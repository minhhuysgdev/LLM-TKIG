    "content": "For more than a decade, Symantec has been publishing monthly intelligence reports, providing a snapshot of what is happening on the threat landscape. Over the years these reports have focused on a variety of activity, covering topics ranging from spam to botnets (and even spam botnets). Back in early 2016, we moved away from PDF reports and launched a new, dynamic page on the Symantec website, providing the latest intelligence available. Today we are happy to share the next iteration of thisLatest Intelligence page. With this new page comes a whole new set of metrics, previously only available annually in the ISTR, along with several old favorites from the intelligence reports over the years. We have also revamped the look and feel of the page, making it easier to navigate, as well as providing a more mobile-device-friendly interface. This new approach allows us the opportunity to tell new stories surrounding the threat landscape. We can now share trends on specific malicious activity classifications, ranging from ransomware, to cryptojacking events, to attacks against IoT devices. To provide a few real-world examples from just last month, financial Trojan activity rose in September by 12.5 percent when compared to August. Then, looking at the specific financial Trojans active during this time frame, we can see that Ramnit is responsible for the lion’s share of activity. However, it appears that this Trojan’s activity declined 6.9 percentage points since August. In comparison, Emotet and Trickybot saw an increase of 8.3 and 2.7 percentage points respectively, likely contributing to the overall increase in activity. Another interesting item that we decided to look at with the launch of this new page is network attack types. The metric reveals that SMB-related attacks dominate this field, comprising around half of all such attacks in a given month. In contrast, attacks against technologies such as Flash and Java, which were quite popular in past years, have declined drastically, well down into the single digits. As we stated in early 2016, when the first version of the Latest Intelligence page launched, the threat landscape is never the same two months in a row. One month there is a jump in web attacks; another might see a spike in downloader activity. This can make the threat landscape a tricky scene to navigate. We hope that ournew Latest Intelligence pagehelps make doing so just a little easier.

    "content": "Symantec has seen a major uptick in formjacking attacks recently, with publicly reported attacks on the websites of companies including Ticketmaster, British Airways, Feedify, and Newegg by a group called Magecart being the most notable examples. Formjacking is a term we use to describe the use of malicious JavaScript code to steal credit card details and other information from payment forms on the checkout web pages of e-commerce sites. Formjacking is not a new technique, but recent campaigns are interesting as they are large, sophisticated, and have increased dramatically since mid-August 2018. Symantec’s Intrusions Prevention System (IPS) technology proactively protects website users from formjacking attacks. When a customer of an e-commerce site clicks “submit” or its equivalent after entering their details into a website’s payment form, malicious JavaScript code that has been injected there by the cyber criminals collects all entered information, such as payment card details and the user’s name and address. This information is then sent to the attacker’s servers. Attackers can then use this information to perform payment card fraud or sell these details to other criminals on the dark web. This is a significant and sustained campaign, with activity increasing substantially in the week of September 13 to 20. According to Symantec telemetry, since August 13 we have blocked 248,000 attempts at formjacking—almost a quarter of a million instances. However, more than one third of those blocks (36 percent) occurred from September 13 to 20, indicating that this activity is increasing. If we compare the week of September 13 to 20 to the same week in August, the number of instances of formjacking blocked by Symantec more than doubled, jumping from just over 41,000 to almost 88,500—a percentage increase of 117 percent. Since August 13, we have blocked an average of 6,368 formjacking attempts every day. Our data shows that any company, anywhere in the world, which processes payments online is a potential victim of formjacking As we can see from the publicly reported attacks, Magecart is targeting large e-commerce businesses like Ticketmaster, British Airways, and Newegg. To get an insight into the type of businesses that are being targeted by formjacking attacks, we examined 1,000 instances of formjacking blocked by Symantec over a three-day period from September 18 to 20. Symantec data showed that from these 1,000 instances 57 individual websites were impacted. These websites were mostly online retail sites ranging from small niche sites to larger retail operations. Websites affected ranged from a fashion retailer in Australia, to a supplier of outdoor accessories in France, and a fitness retailer in Italy. Other retailers affected included a supplier of parts for cars and sites selling kitchen accessories and customized gifts. While the compromise of larger organizations such as British Airways and Ticketmaster makes headlines, our data shows that any company, anywhere in the world, which processes payments online is a potential victim of formjacking. Magecart is the attack group behind the recent formjacking attacks on British Airways, Ticketmaster, Feedify, and Newegg. Magecart has been active since at least 2015. The group injects web-based card skimmers onto websites to steal payment card data and other sensitive information from online payment forms. The group used to primarily focus on hacking into Magneto online stores, but it appears to have changed tactics recently, and we now see it using formjacking and supply chain compromise to steal payment card data. There are many ways attackers can attempt to compromise websites, but in the Ticketmaster formjacking case the Magecart attackers used a supply chain attack to gain access to the website and change the code on its payment page. Wewrote about supply chain attacks in ISTR 23and predicted we would continue to see them occurring frequently in 2018—and we have. Supply chain attacks can allow attackers to gain access to large companies by exploiting weaknesses in smaller businesses used by the larger company to provide different services. Thefamous Petya/NotPetya campaign, for example, was distributed via a supply chain attack. Supply chain attacks are particularly challenging because it doesn’t matter how good your business’ cyber security is if other businesses with access to your network can be exploited by attackers. The uptick in formjacking attacks came to wider notice following the Ticketmasterbreach, which was reported in June. The Magecart attackers injected malicious JavaScript code onto Ticketmaster’s website after they compromised a chatbot from tech firm Inbenta that was used for customer support on Ticketmaster websites. Magecart was then able to alter the JavaScript code on Ticketmaster’s websites to capture payment card data from customers and send it to their servers. The code may have been on the Ticketmaster website for almost a year, with international Ticketmaster customers warned they may have been affected if they bought tickets between September 2017 and June 2018. Inbenta said Magecart had exploited a number of vulnerabilities to target its front-end servers and alter the chatbot code. Following the Ticketmaster breachit was revealed that Magecart was widely targeting third-party companies that are used on e-commerce sitesto manage analytics, website support, and other services. The report at that time said at least 800 e-commerce sites had been hit in that campaign. The danger is that if Magecart can compromise one widely used third-party supplier, they could potentially infect thousands of sites in one go. Feedify is one such third-party service that is used by many websites to serve up push notifications to website visitors. It wasnotified by a threat researcher on September 11 that some of its JavaScript code had been modifiedwith the Magecart script, which prompted Feedify to delete the code. However, within 24 hours the code had been modified again, Feedify again deleted it but it once again reappeared, with threat researchers subsequently warning users of Feedify to stop using it until the issue was resolved. Magecart’sattack on British Airways—which the airline said impacted 380,000 passengers—was, along with Ticketmaster, its most high-profile attack so far. In the attacks on both British Airways andU.S. electronics retailer Newegg, the Magecart attackers took steps to avoid detection, including setting up spoofed web domains designed to look like those of the legitimate company. They even purchased paid SSL certificates from Comodo to make them look more like legitimate servers. British Airways and Newegg were both compromised in a similar manner, with a small amount of JavaScript code added to a page on the companies’ websites to allow entered payment information to be sent to the Magecart attackers’ servers via the spoofed domains. The attacks took place in a similar timeframe, with Magecart present on British Airway’s website from August 21 to September 5, and Newegg’s website from August 14 to September 18. In the cases of both British Airways and Newegg the initial infection vector that allowed the attackers to gain access to the websites is not known. Victims may not realize they are victims of formjacking as generally their websites continue to operate as normal, and attackers like Magecart are sophisticated and stealthy and take steps to avoid detection. Symantec customers are protected from formjacking attacks. Network-based protection File-based protection Website owners should also be aware of the dangers of software supply chain attacks, as these have been used as the infection vector in some of these formjacking attacks. Software supply chain attacks can be difficult to guard against, but there are some steps that website owners can take: Producers of software packages should ensure that they are able to detect unwanted changes in the software update process and on their website. Website owners can also use content security policieswith Subresource Integrity tags (SRI)to lock down any integrated third-party script.

    "content": "We recently observed malware authors using a combination of a tool found on all Windows computers and a usually innocuous file type associated with modifying and rendering XML documents. While these two things—the Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) utility and an eXtensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) file—would not normally raise suspicion if found on a computer, in this case they’re used as part of a multistage infection chain that delivers a modular information-stealing threat. The use of WMI by cyber criminals is not new, however, the tool is typically used for propagation but in this case is used to download a malicious file. The use of WMIC is beneficial for the attackers as it helps them to remain inconspicuous and also provides them with a powerful tool to aid them in their activities. The WMIC utility provides a command-line interface for WMI, which is used for an array of administrative capabilities for local and remote systems and can be used to query system settings, stop processes, and locally or remotely execute scripts. Parallels can be drawn between WMIC and PowerShell, another legitimate tool which is also found on Windows systems and is increasingly being abused by cyber criminals. PowerShell’s popularity among cyber criminals was highlighted when Symantec saw a661 percent increase in malicious PowerShell activityfrom H2 2017 to H1 2018. The use of WMIC here, as well as a host of additional legitimate dual-use tools used in this attack, adds to the continuing evidence of cyber criminals using so-called “living off the land” tactics in order to reduce the chances of their activity being detected. Thankfully Symantec has multiple technologies in place to protect customers from these types of attacks and the tactics used in this particular case were successfully blocked by our file-, behavior-, and network-based protection including Symantec’s advanced machine learning technology. Malware authors are continuously trying to fly under the radar of security products. Their attack techniques are evolving, and they are constantly coming up with new ways to introduce their malware onto computers. For instance, they may drop an encrypted payload and decrypt it in memory to try and bypass security detections. Or instead of directly downloading and executing the payload, they may make use of non-PE files to drop their malware. They may also try to exploit Microsoft tools to download payloads, as we’ve observed in this case. As previously mentioned, as part of our ongoing work to protect customers from these types of attacks we spotted an attack chain that incorporates many layers of obscurity. Email password stealer- The malware uses the MailPassview utility to capture email account passwords. Web browser password stealer- The malware uses WebBrowser Passview to steal passwords stored in web browsers. Keylogger- The malware uses the global keyboard hook WindowsKeyboardhook to capture keystrokes and writes all keystrokes into a file in an encrypted form. It also logs the contents of the clipboard and active window titles. The keylogger requires the keyboard layout to be set to Japanese in order to capture keystrokes. It checks for keyboard layout type value 0x7 (Japanese keyboard). If the value doesn’t match it will not capture keystrokes. The keylogger cannot connect to the command and control (C&C) servers by itself – the network module is required to transfer the stolen information to the attackers’ servers. Network/phishing- The malware uses the phishing module and uses http://renivaxx01.gettrails[DOT]com/01/ for phishing. The remaining three modules—File browser, Backdoor, Coinminer—are unremarkable and their functionality is just as their names suggest.

    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/mirai-cross-platform-infection",
    "content": "It’s safe to say that the last few years have been eventful when it comes to the Internet of Things (IoT) threat landscape, with new waves of distributed denial of service (DDoS) bots emerging with increasing regularity. Ever since thefirst reported incidentof the Mirai botnet (Linux.Mirai) back in 2016, followed by the malware’s source code being leaked, the number of variants of this family has been growing steadily, their success helped along by an environment of poorly managed IoT devices. As it is, the IoT market is hugely fragmented and most of the devices do not receive software patches for the known vulnerabilities. To make things worse, the malware authors continue to evolve these variants, making the malware more powerful and portable across different platforms and architectures. One of the major pain points for a cross-platform IoT botnet is portability. The malware must be able to run on different architectures and platforms in a self-contained capsule without any runtime surprises or misconfiguration. This is also an area where many inexperienced malware authors, or script-kiddies, fail if they simply copy/paste and reuse the existing malware code base. At the end of July, I came across a live remote server hosting multiple malware variants, each for a specific platform. As with many Mirai infections, it starts by firing a shell script on a vulnerable device. That shell script sequentially tries downloading and executing individual executables one by one until a binary compliant with the current architecture is found. The successfully executed executable file is responsible for the actual Mirai payload, such as enumerating a list of IP addresses by creating a list of random addresses and scanning for devices with default credentials, or vulnerabilities. While this is similar behavior to the Mirai variants we’ve seen so far, what makes it interesting is the compiled binary. These variants have been created by leveraging an open-source project calledAboriginal Linuxthat makes the process of cross-compilation easy, effective, and practically fail-proof. It should be noted that there is nothing malicious or wrong with this open-source project, the malware authors are once again leveraging legitimate tools to supplement their creations, this time with an effective cross compilation solution. Given that the existing code base is combined with an elegant cross-compilation framework, the resultant malware variants are more robust and compatible with multiple architectures and devices, making it executable on a wide variety of devices ranging from routers, IP cameras, connected devices, and even Android devices. For example, Figure 2 shows an ARM7 malware variant running on an Android device running Android 4.4, and Figure 3 shows the sample running on Debian ARM. The remainder of the malware’s functionalities are consistent with known Mirai behavior. For example, when I executed the sample in a contained environment, it attempted to scan more than 500,000 IP addresses generated through the random generation process previously described, and then tried to send raw packet data over port 23.

    "title": "jrat new anti parsing techniques",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/jrat-new-anti-parsing-techniques",
    "content": "We have recently observed a newer version of the cross-platform jRAT (Trojan.Maljava) remote access Trojan (RAT) in the wild. This version uses new techniques to evade parsing and detection, as well as to prevent itself from being reverse-engineered, by prepending corrupt MZ files before the malicious JAR file. We first spotted this version of jRAT in early November 2017. In April 2018, we noticed its number increased more than 300 percent to 1,071 from 333 in March. There could be two reasons why we have not seen huge hits for this version: 1) It wants to remain stealthy and difficult to detect, and used only for targeted attacks; and 2) It may not be widely adopted yet among attackers. While the volumes of these attacks are on the lower side, this jRAT has shown that it is quite capable and can go undetected with minimum presence and anti-parsing methods. The malware mainly targets the financial sector, but we’ve also seen infections in the service, communications, hospitality, government, and energy sectors. The malware mainly targets the financial sector, but we’ve also seen infections in the service, communications, hospitality, governments, and energy sectors. The infection chain begins with spam emails, which are specially crafted using social engineering techniques to entice victims into opening the attachment. We’ve seen several themes for emails distributing this version of jRAT, including: The emails contain a JAR file attachment. This file comes with a surprise MZ header, as well as two corrupt MZ files prepended before the JAR file. This thwarts not only MZ parsers, but Java parsers as well. These files do not contain \\x00 bytes, which indicates the intent. The MZ files cannot be parsed due to a broken PE structure; the files appear to be full MZ but apparently are used only for evading parsers. This may be considered a defense layer to protect the JAR file from being reverse-engineered. Surprisingly, Java is still able to load and execute this JAR file as weaker zip parsing implementations rely on end of central directory record and parses the content to locate and execute main class. This file can be recognized as jRAT by looking at the class names. The wrapper JAR file drops a secondary JAR file and copies it to a%Temp%location. The payload JAR file can be extracted using AES decryption. The first 16 bytes in the file “k”seen in Figure 4 contains the key and the file “e” is the encrypted Java payload. The JAR runs every time Windows starts, and starts executing and connecting to its command and control (C&C) server at84.[REMOVED].132.145. It uses a WMIC interface to identify antivirus products installed on the compromised computer and firewall details. wmic /node:localhost /namespace:\\\\root\\SecurityCenter2 path AntiVirusProduct get /format:list The configuration file and key file are visible, but the former is AES-encrypted. The JAR file contains various classes for platform-specific implementations for capturing screenshots, playing audio, downloading and executing files, I/O to and from files, logging keystrokes, among others. This new version of jRAT has the following capabilities: With these capabilities, the malware can violate victims’ privacy and capture and exfiltrate confidential information from target organizations. It’s also potentially capable of running on the following platforms: FreeBSD, OpenBSD, OSX, Solaris, Linux, Windows, and Android. Symantec and Norton products detect this threat as the following: Symantec Email Security.cloud technology blocks attacks such as this using advanced heuristics.

    "content": "Cryptocurrency coinminers are the new ransomware and malicious actors have already pounced on the opportunity to make their fortune. Symantec has beentrackinga large-scale coin-mining campaign which, as per Shodan, has currently infected about 157,000 MikroTik routers. Researchers discovered this coin-mining campaign in early August 2018. The campaign was initially concentrated in Brazil; however, it soon began infecting routers around the world. I decided to take a closer look at one of these infected routers to get a better understanding at what’s going on. At the outset, the compromised router has multiple services running on it. Interestingly, the infected router had the default web service disabled. Pointing a browser to the infected router’s port 80, causes it to serve the Coinhive script responsible for coin mining (Figure 2). But when the infected router is found in between a client sending a request and a server receiving it, this HTML page is only served when there’s an error. This is because internally the router is configured with a firewall rule that helps serve this malicious HTML page. Using network address translation (NAT), the firewall rule takes traffic bound to port 80and redirects it to port 8080 (Figure 3). The router is also configured to run a default proxy server on port 8080that’s responsible for serving the Coinhive script. Looking at the webproxypath,we can find the actual file (error.html)that holds the coin-mining script that’s served every time there’s an error. The error.html file is available from the following path: /webproxy/error.html When the router is compromised, the hackers schedule multiple scripts to run at various times. These scheduled scripts are created to download the error.htmlpage onto the router, which allows the hackers to drop various versions of the error.html page if they wish. These scheduled jobs are set up by another script which is executed on the compromised router during the initial stages of infection. This script is hosted on the min01.com/01/a113.rsc server, as seen in Figure 6. This script is responsible for performing multiple malicious actions on the router including, but not limited to: It’s likely that this script was downloaded using the inbuilt/tool fetchcommand and run using the/importcommand. All of the infected MikroTik routers (v6.29 to v6.42) that I encountered were running the Winboxservice, which is known to be vulnerable toCVE-2018-14847. When exploited successfully, this flaw can allow an attacker to bypass authentication and compromise the router. After the router is compromised, the hackers can load their malicious error page, which is displayed any time a user accessing the internet via the router encounters an HTTP error. Every time the error page is displayed, the victim is unknowingly mining Monero (XMR) for the hackers. These routers are used by many organizations and businesses, including internet service providers. While MikroTik was prompt in patching CVE-2018-14847, unfortunately poor patching practices by vendors and users mean that there are plenty of vulnerable routers still out there. The following Symantec intrusion prevention system (IPS) detections blocked this coin-mining campaign from day one: Figure 7 shows Symantec IPS detections protecting users from this coin-mining campaign. MikroTik has already published a patch to address CVE-2018-14847. Symantec recommends users to install the patch on their routers, if they have not done so already. Users can also consider disabling the following services on their routers, if not required: Karthikeyan is a member of Symantec’s Security Technology and Response team which is focused on providing round-the-clock protection against current and future cyber threats.

    "title": "leafminer espionage middle east",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/leafminer-espionage-middle-east",
    "content": "Symantec has uncovered the operations of a threat actor named Leafminer that is targeting a broad list of government organizations and business verticals in various regions in the Middle East since at least early 2017. The group tends to adapt publicly available techniques and tools for their attacks and experiments with published proof-of-concept exploits. Leafminer attempts to infiltrate target networks through various means of intrusion: watering hole websites, vulnerability scans of network services on the internet, and brute-force/dictionary login attempts. The actor’s post-compromise toolkit suggests that the group is looking for email data, files, and database servers on compromised target systems. During our investigation, there was a breakthrough discovery that helped connect Leafminer to a number of attacks observed on systems in the Middle East and identify the toolkit used in the group’s efforts of intrusion, lateral movement, and exfiltration. The download URL for a malware payload used in one of the attacks lead to the identification of a compromised web server on the domain e-qht.az that had been used to distribute Leafminer’s arsenal of malware, payloads, and tools within the group and make them available for download from victim machines. As of early June 2018, the server hosted 112 files in a subdirectory that could be accessed through a public web shell planted by the attackers. In addition to malware and tools, the served files also included uploads of log files seemingly originating from vulnerability scans and post-compromise tools. The web shell is a modification of the PhpSpy backdoor and references the author MagicCoder while linking to the (deleted) domain magiccoder.ir. Researching the hacker handle MagicCoder results in references to the Iranian hacking forum Ashiyane as well as defacements by the Iranian hacker group Sun Army. During the investigation of the Leafminer group, we were able to assemble a targeting profile from different sources including telemetry and log files hosted publicly on the attacker’s arsenal server. One interesting source of target information discovered during the Leafminer investigation was a list of 809 targets used by the attackers for vulnerability scans. Symantec detection telemetry shows malware and custom tools used by Leafminer on 44 systems across four regions in the Middle East. One interesting source of target information discovered during the Leafminer investigation was a list of 809 targets used by the attackers for vulnerability scans. The list is written in the Iranian language Farsi and groups each entry with organization of interest by geography and industry. Figure 3 shows a breakdown of the industry verticals. Targeted regions included in the list are Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, and Afghanistan. We observed three main techniques used by Leafminer for initial intrusion of target networks: There are indicators that suggest the attackers have also employed email phishing with malicious attachment files. However, this was not directly observed or captured. Our investigation of Leafminer started with the discovery of JavaScript code on several compromised websites in the Middle East. The obfuscated code was planted by the attackers to steal SMB credential hashes that could subsequently be brute-forced offline. When executing the code, the browser creates an invisible image tag and sets the URL to an attack server using the file:// protocol scheme. On Windows machines, this triggers a request to a remote server via the Samba networking protocol (SMB) that also transmits the user’s login NTLM hash. These hashes can be cracked to retrieve the original login password by methods of brute-force, dictionary, or rainbow table lookups. Table 1 shows an overview of the compromised websites used as watering holes, infected JavaScript URLs, and SMB URLs used to collect NTLM hashes. Interestingly, the same technique was also observed in watering hole attacks by the threat actorDragonfly in 2017 as reported by Symantec. As previously mentioned, Leafminer seems to be actively following developments and publications of the offensive security community when selecting their toolkit. This became especially apparent when analyzing the group’s techniques and tools for vulnerability scans and exploitation. The compromised web server used to store Leafminer’s arsenal hosted several public proof-of-concept exploits and exploitation tools. This included the Fuzzbunch framework that was part of an infamous leak of exploits and tools by the Shadow Brokers in April 2017. Leafminer has developed exploit payloads for this framework (Table 2) that deliver custom malware through attacks against SMB vulnerabilitiesdescribed by Microsoft. The EternalBlue exploit from the framework received worldwide attention after being used in the ransomware campaignsWannaCryin May andPetya/NotPetyain June 2017. The Leafminer operators use EternalBlue to attempt lateral movement within target networks from compromised staging servers. Symantec also observed attempts by Leafminer to scan for theHeartbleedvulnerability (CVE-2014-0160) from an attacker-controlled IP address. Furthermore, the Leafminer arsenal server hosted a Python script to scan for this vulnerability. Another intrusion approach used by Leafminer seems a lot less sophisticated than the previously described methods but can be just as effective: using specific hacktools to guess the login passwords for services exposed by a targeted system. This type of attack was observed both via dedicated servers set up by Leafminer as well as staging servers compromised by the group. Commands found in a readme text that was stored in a ZIP archive together with the hacktool THC Hydra in Leafminer’s tool arsenal represent online dictionary attacks on Microsoft Exchange and Remote Desktop Protocol services of regional government servers in Saudi Arabia. \"Online\" in this case refers to the attacker using the protocol of the targeted network service to quickly run through many password guesses. Symantec identified two strains of custom malware used by the Leafminer group:Trojan.ImecabandBackdoor.Sorgu. Directly connected to this malware are several sets of reflective loader DLLs used as droppers or to execute specific commands on a compromised system. The development of custom malware by Leafminer as well as some of the tools used for lateral movement show a preference for the .NET framework. We also observed that the attackers would download and install the .NET framework on compromised machines, supposedly in the situation that an operator would have remote access to the system but required .NET to run Leafminer's custom tools. To this end, the command and control (C&C) server operated by the group hosted the legitimate setup executable for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 SP2. Backdoor.Sorgu is used by the attackers to provide remote access to the infected machine. The backdoor is installed as a service in the Windows system through a shell command script. The purpose of Trojan.Imecab is to set up a persistent remote access account on the target machine with a hardcoded password. Variants of the malware were also observed with the filename guester.exe which likely refers to the functionality of adding a powerful guest account to the system. The malware installs itself in the system as a Windows service to achieve persistence and ensure that the guest account remains available to the attacker. Table 2 gives an overview of the reflective loader DLLs and their purpose: These DLLs were likely used as payloads for exploit shellcode of the Fuzzbunch framework, which is also evidenced by the embedded PDB strings. The discovery of malware and hacktools hosted on e-qht.az allowed us to correlate detection telemetry of potential Leafminer intrusions with tools made available for download to the group’s operators. Understanding the purpose of the tools used by the attacker gives a unique insight into the tactics and procedures used by Leafminer after the initial compromise of a target network. Table 3 outlines the observed toolset for lateral movement, information gathering, and exfiltration. We discovered a number of servers compromised by Leafminer that were used as staging systems to gain a foothold in the targeted network and execute attacks on intranet resources. For example, the use of THC Hydra to execute dictionary attacks against Exchange logins was observed both in initial intrusion attempts as well as in lateral attacks from staging systems. Figure 4 shows a screenshot of the Total SMB BruteForcer hacktool used by Leafminer for lateral movement. The tool requires input files with lists of IPs, users, and passwords respectively. The arsenal server hosted five text files that could be used by Leafminer operators as input for dictionary attacks using Total SMB Bruteforcer and THC Hydra. One of the custom tools used by the Leafminer group is a rebranded version of the widespread post-exploitation tool Mimikatz. While the logo and commands are identical to the original hacktool, the name was changed to OrangeTeghal. To evade security software while deploying this tool on compromised systems, the attackers use a technique revealed at Black Hat EU ‘17 in the presentationLost in Transaction: Process Doppelgänging. The malware file orange64.exe is a .NET executable that drops and executes a PowerShell script with basic obfuscation. After deobfuscation, this script closely resembles the code published by the authors of the technique. Process Doppelgänging uses NTFS transactions to modify the executable of a seemingly benign process that is suspended right after creation. Leafminer is a highly active group, responsible for targeting a range of organizations across the Middle East. The group appears to be based in Iran and seems to be eager to learn from and capitalize on tools and techniques used by more advanced threat actors. On a broad level, it has followed the recent trend among targeted attack groups for “living off the land”—using a mixture of publicly available tools alongside its own custom malware. More specifically, it mimicked Dragonfly’s use of a watering hole to harvest network credentials. It also capitalized on the Shadow Brokers release ofInception Frameworktools, making use of the leaked Fuzzbunch framework by developing its own exploit payloads for it. Leafminer’s eagerness to learn from others suggests some inexperience on the part of the attackers, a conclusion that’s supported by the group’s poor operational security. Leafminer has also been tracking developments in the world of cyber security. After the Heartbleed bug was disclosed it began scanning for instances of the vulnerability. It also utilized Process Doppelgänging, a detection evasion technique first discussed at the Black Hat EU conference last year. However, Leafminer’s eagerness to learn from others suggests some inexperience on the part of the attackers, a conclusion that’s supported by the group’s poor operational security. It made a major blunder in leaving a staging server publicly accessible, exposing the group’s entire arsenal of tools. That one misstep provided us with a valuable trove of intelligence to help us better defend our customers against further Leafminer attacks. Symantec has the following protections in place to protect customers against Leafminer attacks: File-based protection Customers of the DeepSight IntelligenceManaged Adversary and Threat Intelligence(MATI) service have received intelligence that details the characteristics of the Leafminer cyber espionage group and methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this adversary.

    "title": "evolution emotet trojan distributor",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/evolution-emotet-trojan-distributor",
    "content": "Mealybug is a cyber crime actor that has been active since at least 2014. It is identified by its use of its custom malware,Trojan.Emotet. It appears to have changed its business model in recent times, evolving from targeting banking customers in Europe to using its infrastructure to act as a global packing and delivery service for other threat actors. Because it can self-propagate, Emotet presents a particular challenge for organizations. Network worms have been experiencing a kind of renaissance, with notable examples like WannaCry (Ransom.Wannacry) and Petya/NotPetya (Ransom.Petya). Network spreading also means that victims can become infected without ever clicking on a malicious link or downloading a malicious attachment. Once on a computer, Emotet downloads and executes a spreader module that contains a password list that it uses to attempt to brute force access to other machines on the same network. Emotet’s method of self-propagation—brute forcing passwords—has additional potential to cause major headaches for organizations as it may result in multiple failed login attempts, which can lead to users becoming locked out of their network accounts. This has the knock-on effect of increased calls to IT helpdesks and general loss of productivity. This was a hallmark of the notorious Conficker (W32.Downadup) threat and, 10 years later, threats continue to cause similar problems. As well as brute forcing passwords, Emotet can also spread to additional computers using a spam module that it installs on infected victim machines. This module generates emails that use standard social engineering techniques and typically contain subject lines including words such as “Invoice”. Some subject lines include the name of the person whose email account has been compromised, to make it seem less like a spam email. The emails typically contain a malicious link or attachment which if launched will result in them becoming infected with Trojan.Emotet. Most recently, Mealybug appears to have expanded its operations to primarily become a distributor of threats for other attack groups. When Mealybug was first identified in 2014 it was using Emotet to spread banking Trojans, and was focused on targeting banking customers in Germany. At the time, Mealybug was using Trojan.Emotet as the loader portion ofW32.Cridex.B, a rewritten version of the Cridex banking Trojan. In 2015, Mealybug started targeting Swiss banking customers as well and evolved Emotet into more modular malware. The new version of Emotet had separate modules for its loader, banking data theft, email login theft, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and malicious spam. Mealybug has primarily been engaged in using Emotet for the delivery of banking Trojans, and in 2017 it was the first group to deliver the IcedID (Trojan.IcedID) banking Trojan. However, also in 2017, it was observed delivering theTrojan.TrickybotandRansom.UmbreCryptransomware.  Mealybug has developed its capabilities over the years and now appears to offer an “end-to-end” service for delivery of threats. It delivers the threats, obfuscates them to reduce the chances of detection, and provides a spreader module that allows the threats to self-propagate. Emotet gets an initial foothold on a victim machine or network by sending an email containing either a malicious link that leads to a downloader document or that has a malicious document attached. Anti-analysis tactics have been present in Emotet since at least 2015 and, in 2018, Emotet’s payload consists of a packed file containing the main component and an anti-analysis module. The anti-analysis module performs multiple checks to ensure it is not being run on a malware research machine, then loads the main component. Either PowerShell or JavaScript is used to download the Trojan, which delivers a packed payload file to the victim machine. Once on a machine, the latest version of Emotet: It can then download any new payloads from the C&C server, and execute them. Emotet can download an updated version of itself, or any other threat. Existing versions of Emotet download modules from the C&C server that include: According to Symantec telemetry for the first half of 2018, its focus now is mainly on targets in the U.S. All information stolen by these modules is sent to the C&C server. Emotet also has a DDoS module that can add the infected machine to a botnet to carry out DDoS attacks. Emotet’s geographic targets have also increased significantly over the years. After a relatively quiet period since 2015, detections of Emotet surged in the second half of 2017, and in that year Mealybug’s targets included victims in Canada, China, the UK, and Mexico. However, according to Symantec telemetry for the first half of 2018, its focus now is mainly on targets in the U.S. Since February 2018, Emotet has been used to spreadW32.Qakbot, a family of banking Trojans known for behaving like network worms. Like Emotet, Qakbot can self-propagate. Qakbot attempts brute force access to spread across networks and also uses “living-off-the-land” tools to propagate. It uses PowerShell to download and run Mimikatz (Hacktool.Mimikatz), an open-source credential stealing tool that allows attackers to move rapidly across a network once they have established an initial foothold. The fact that both Emotet and Qakbot have self-spreading capabilities mean that once these threats get onto your network they can spread aggressively. The fact that both attempt brute force access to spread across networks also increases the risk of users being locked out of their devices. A spike in Qakbot detections in February 2018 indicates that “double-spreading” of the threat was taking place, meaning that Mealybug was using Emotet to spread Qakbot across networks, while Qakbot was simultaneously using its own self-spreading capabilities. The account lockout scenario is a very real danger, and a potential major headache for organizations. Symantec analysis shows that Emotet and Qakbot are packed with the same packer, but there are multiple factors that suggest Mealybug is only providing Emotet as a delivery service for the actors behind Qakbot, and is not controlling the Trojan. There does not appear to be any overlap between the C&C infrastructure of the two Trojans, and analysis also revealed differences in the code of their main components and in their anti-debugging techniques. Mealybug using two different spreading mechanisms is also surprising because, as mentioned above, both Trojans attempting to brute force passwords could trigger account lockouts and stop the Trojans from spreading. It is unlikely Mealybug would use the two different spreading techniques if it was controlling both Trojans. For these reasons we believe Emotet and Qakbot are controlled by two separate groups, and that Mealybug is offering Emotet as a delivery mechanism for other threats. Mealybug seems to have found its niche as a provider of delivery services for other threats. The main component of Trojan.Emotet functions as a loader, and can theoretically support any payload. While it is still primarily known for distributing banking Trojans, it can in theory spread any threat, and there have been reports of it distributing the Ransom.UmbreCrypt ransomware. Mealybug presumably makes its money by taking a cut of the profits made by the threat actors who use its services. From what we can see, Mealybug appears to be operating for more than one attack group at a time, so we have no evidence that it offers itself as an “exclusive” distributor. In November 2017, Mealybug was observed delivering the Trojan.Trickybot and W32.Qakbot threats simultaneously onto the same machine in a few instances, and in one case within a few minutes. Mealybug’s shift from distributing its own banking Trojan to a relatively small number of targets, to acting primarily as a global distributor of other groups’ threats is interesting, and backs up an observation we made inthe ISTRthat threat actors are evolving and refining their techniques and business model to maximize profits. In the ISTR we outlined how some threat actors appeared to be turning to coin mining as it became hugely profitable due to the rise in the value of cryptocurrencies. It appears Mealybug has decided that it can best maximize its returns through taking a role as distributor. It may be that Mealybug was finding it harder to make money exclusively from banking Trojans so it had to change its approach. The growth in popularity and use by banks of two-factor authentication (2FA) has made it more difficult to compromise accounts by stealing credentials, and awareness and protection has improved as online banking has matured. Mealybug activity presents a number of challenges for organizations, including: Symantec has had protection for Mealybug attacks since the initial identification of the group’s activities in 2014 and blocks such activities at every level of Mealybug’s attack chain. Macro downloader stage: Main module file stage: Main module loaded stage: C&C communication stage: Spam and stealer and spreader module stage: Emotet spreader infection stage: Targeted Attack Analytics Symantec’s newTargeted Attack Analytics (TAA), available inour ATP Productcan detect attacks where an executable spreads to multiple machines across a network via credential theft, brute forcing, or an exploit. TAA detects Emotet’s malicious activity due to patterns in its spreading behavior. In particular, TAA will detect when files are dropped by Emotet’s spreader module on multiple machines in an organization. Customers of the DeepSight IntelligenceManaged Adversary and Threat Intelligence(MATI) service have received multiple reports on Emotet.  These reports detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of the group that leverages this Trojan.

    "title": "powershell threats grow further and operate plain sight",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/powershell-threats-grow-further-and-operate-plain-sight",
    "content": "The preinstalled and versatile Windows PowerShell has become one of the most popular choices in cyber criminals’ arsenals. We have observed an increase of 661 percent in computers where malicious PowerShell activity was blocked from the second half of 2017 to the first half of 2018—a clear indication that attackers are still growing the use of PowerShell in their attacks. Of course, it is not just a method seen with targeted attack groups, but also among common cyber criminals deploying financial Trojans or cryptocurrency miners. Especially for fileless attacks, where no file is written to disk, such PowerShell scripts have become very popular, as recently seen with theGhostMinerandBluwimpsworms that distribute coinminers directly in memory. The whole “living off the land” tactic, of which PowerShell is a part, is very popular these days. Dual-use tools such as WMI or PsExec, which are commonly seen during attacks, are another frequently observed aspect of this tactic. Attackers are constantly experimenting with scripts, learning, and sharing their experience among themselves. In addition, PowerShell frameworks such as PowerSploit or Empire have made it easy not only for penetration testers but also attackers to integrate malicious scripts into their toolset. We extensively discussed PowerShell threats in our December 2016white paper, and most of the analysis is still valid today. However, we wanted to see how much the malicious usage has changed since then. To get a better understanding of today’s landscape, we analyzed more than 115,000 randomly selected malicious PowerShell command lines that we saw in 2018. Many of them came from Microsoft Office documents or self-propagating worms. The first thing that caught our eye was that, even though there are many obfuscation tricks available for PowerShell and even automated tools that can obfuscate scripts for users, these are rarely used in the wild. Only four percent of the PowerShell command lines we analyzed tried to obfuscate themselves by using a mixture of lower- and uppercase letters. And even those that do are often auto-generated by some toolkit with a poor randomizer. The following are two examples that were embedded into Microsoft Office documents: Of course, the classical string rearranging with the “-f” function or string concatenation are also used in an attempt to fool simple pattern matching. In our test set, we saw it used by 3.2 percent of the samples: Isolated cases of other string manipulation or special characters like the tick do occur as well, but very rarely: Occasionally there are PowerShell scripts generated by frameworks such as Invoke-Obfuscation resulting in cryptic scripts which make use of ConvertTo-SecureString and SecureStringToGlobalAllocUnicode. Many attackers probably are not too concerned about obfuscation because they know that not everybody is monitoring PowerShell activity anyway. Even if the security personnel do, then a non-obfuscated command line might be more likely to slip unnoticed through the cracks. Too much obfuscation can be a red flag. Of course, another option for the attacker is to use a BASE64-encoded blob to hide their commands, resulting in an extra step of decoding required, before the payload can be seen. This is often done by all kinds of scripts, including benign ones. From all analyzed scripts, 5.7 percent used a BASE64-encoded string to hide their commands. With 80 percent of this subset of scripts, most simply used the built-in “-EncodedCommand” command line argument or a variation thereof to decode and run their commands. But some attackers used other commands to achieve the same results, as there are usually many ways to reach a goal with PowerShell: The most common command line parameters we observed are still “-NoP -NonI -W Hidden”. Although the arguments can be written in different ways, most attackers stick to the short version. Regardless of the typing, we see that they appear in about three out of four command lines. The ExecutionPolicy flag is not used that often, as it is not needed when only one command is executed by the script. From all analyzed scripts, 5.7 percent used a BASE64-encoded string to hide their commands. With 80 percent of this subset of scripts, most simply used the built-in “-EncodedCommand” command line argument or a variation thereof to decode and run their commands. Some attackers are quite upfront about their intentions. We regularly see attackers trying to download and invokeHacktool.Mimikatzor Meterpreter shell directly from open source code repositories without even trying to hide it, although they only make up less than half a percent. One of the main goals of most malicious PowerShell scripts is still to download and execute some remote payload. From all samples analyzed, 17 percent downloaded something through HTTP or HTTPS. The scripts are getting more robust and often try multiple URLs, use the local proxy settings, or set a specific user agent in order to succeed. However, the user agent is not always used to blend in by spoofing an installed browser or Office application. Some downloader threats use it to track different campaigns or prevent anyone from accidentally downloading the payload without the right password. For example, one very active PowerShell downloader often uses “USR-KL” or “USRUE-VNC” as user agent when downloading the next stage. But looking at other instances indicates that they do some granular tracking as well: “LL-Chrome”, “Linux-MK”, “CA_SKULL”, “US-SKULL”. They likely know that these strings are visible, and therefore sometimes have fun as well, e.g. “Rembo 20”, “TrumpOK 1.0.0”, “Breakthrough 1.0.0”. The number of computers where PowerShell commands were executed doubled from 734,262 in Q1 2018 to 1,451,449 in Q2 2018. In May 2018, we saw PowerShell scripts being executed on an average of 480,000 computers per day. Of course, not every invocation of PowerShell is malicious. As a matter of fact, the majority of cases are benign scripts and only 0.8 percent were malicious, but don’t let that fool you—the threat from malicious PowerShell is definitely increasing. The high number of PowerShell activity makes it obvious that you cannot just ban all PowerShell activity on a computer. At Symantec, we use the vast number of data to feed our various protection engines such as behavioral detection or advanced machine learning. With this telemetry data, we can then find previously unknown malicious scripts and stop them, without affecting the regular administration work on the system. The number of computers where PowerShell commands were executed doubled from 734,262 in Q1 2018 to 1,451,449 in Q2 2018. In May 2018, we saw PowerShell scripts being executed on an average of 480,000 computers per day. We see that PowerShell is still heavily used as part of the living off the land tactic for lateral movement, downloaders, and fileless threats. This trend is most likely to increase further in combination with dual-use tools. Most attackers don’t even try to hide their intention very much. Unfortunately, they often do not have to and are still successful since many system administrators do not monitor such activity. The attacker can hide in plain sight with all the benign PowerShell activity that occurs. One has to look carefully to spot the malicious activity with the naked eye. Now that Windows PowerShell officially has a built-in SSH client, we expect even more legitimate use of PowerShell on various systems and some malicious scripts misusing SSH too.

    "title": "thrip hits satellite telecoms defense targets",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/thrip-hits-satellite-telecoms-defense-targets",
    "content": "One of the most significant developments in cyber espionage in recent years has been the number of groups adopting “living off the land” tactics. That’s our shorthand for the use of operating system features or legitimate network administration tools to compromise victims’ networks. The purpose of living off the land is twofold. By using such features and tools, attackers are hoping to blend in on the victim’s network and hide their activity in a sea of legitimate processes. Secondly, even if malicious activity involving these tools is detected, it can make it harder to attribute attacks. If everyone is using similar tools, it’s more difficult to distinguish one group from another. Most attack groups do still create and leverage custom malware, but it tends to be employed sparingly, reducing the risk of discovery. This doesn’t mean espionage attacks are now going undiscovered, but it does mean that they can take longer for analysts to investigate. This is one of the reasons why Symantec createdTargeted Attack Analytics (TAA), which takes tools and capabilities that we’ve developed for our own analysts and makes them available to our Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) customers. TAA leverages advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning that combs through Symantec’s data lake of telemetry in order to spot patterns associated with targeted attacks. Its advanced AI automates what previously would have taken thousands of hours of analyst time. This makes it far easier for us, and for our customers, to find that “needle in the haystack.” It was TAA that led us to the latest cyber espionage campaign we’ve uncovered. Back in January 2018, TAA triggered an alert at a large telecoms operator in Southeast Asia. An attacker was using PsExec to move laterally between computers on the company’s network. PsExec is a Microsoft Sysinternals tool for executing processes on other systems and is one of the most frequently seen legitimate pieces of software used by attackers attempting to live off the land. However, it’s also widely used for legitimate purposes, meaning malicious use of PsExec can be difficult to spot. TAA not only flagged this malicious use of PsExec, it also told us what the attackers were using it for. They were attempting to remotely install a previously unknown piece of malware (Infostealer.Catchamas) on computers within the victim’s network. Armed with this information about the malware and living off the land tactics being used by this group of attackers whom we named Thrip, we broadened our search to see if we could find similar patterns that indicated Thrip had been targeting other organizations. We uncovered a wide-ranging cyber espionage campaign involving powerful malware being used against targets that are a cause for concern. We identified three computers in China being used to launch the Thrip attacks. Thrip’s motive is likely espionage and its targets include those in the communications, geospatial imaging, and defense sectors, both in the United States and Southeast Asia. Perhaps the most worrying discovery we made was that Thrip had targeted a satellite communications operator. The attack group seemed to be particularly interested in the operational side of the company, looking for and infecting computers running software that monitors and controls satellites. This suggests to us that Thrip’s motives go beyond spying and may also include disruption. Another target was an organization involved in geospatial imaging and mapping. Again, Thrip seemed to be mainly interested in the operational side of the company. It targeted computers running MapXtreme Geographic Information System (GIS) software which is used for tasks such as developing custom geospatial applications or integrating location-based data into other applications. It also targeted machines running Google Earth Server and Garmin imaging software. The satellite operator wasn’t the only communications target Thrip was interested in. The group had also targeted three different telecoms operators, all based in Southeast Asia. In all cases, based on the nature of the computers infected by Thrip, it appeared that the telecoms companies themselves and not their customers were the targets of these attacks. In addition, there was a fourth target of interest, a defense contractor. Thrip uses a mixture of custom malware and living off the land tools to perform its attacks. The latter include: All of these tools, with the exception of Mimikatz (which is almost always used maliciously), have legitimate uses. For example, PowerShell is widely used within enterprises and the vast majority of scripts are legitimate. Similarly, PsExec is frequently used by systems administrators. However, in this case, it was Thrip’s use of PsExec that drew our attention. Through advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, TAA has trained itself to spot patterns of malicious activity. While PsExec itself may be innocuous, the way that it was being used here triggered an alert by TAA. In short, Thrip’s attempts at camouflage blew its cover. While Thrip now makes heavy use of living off the land tactics, it also employs custom malware (Infostealer.Catchamas), particularly against computers of interest. Catchamas is a custom Trojan designed to steal information from an infected computer and contains additional features designed to avoid detection. From the initial alert triggered by TAA, we were able to follow a trail that eventually enabled us to see the bigger picture of a cyber espionage campaign originating from computers within China and targeting multiple organizations in the U.S. and Southeast Asia. Espionage is the group’s likely motive but given its interest in compromising operational systems, it could also adopt a more aggressive, disruptive stance should it choose to do so. The following protections are in place to protect customers against Thrip attacks: File-based protection Network protection products Threat intelligenceIn addition to file-based protection, customers of theDeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence(MATI) service have received reports on Thrip, which detail methods of detecting and thwarting activities of this group.

Symantec identified up to 7,700 distinct organizations targeted in such attacks during 2017, with each organization being attacked an average of 4.9 times during the year. As well as pursuing technical measures to block such attacks against targets, since December of 2015, Symantec has been participating in a private industry and law enforcement working group with the goal of arresting business email compromise (BEC) attackers. That joint effort, by over 450 individuals spread across private sector companies and international law enforcement agencies, has helped to enableOperation Wire-Wire, resulting in the arrest of 74 individuals in recent months. Symantec was able to contribute to this effort through the identification of email accounts and infrastructure used by various attackers. Symantec will continue to cooperate with industry and law enforcement in order to pursue additional arrests.

    "content": "UPDATE: September 26, 2018:This blog has been updated to include new information that was released by Cisco Talos on seven new Stage 3 modules. For further details see below. UPDATE: June 6, 2018:This blog has been updated to include new information that was released by Cisco Talos. This includes an expanded list of vulnerable devices and details on a newly discovered stage 3 module known as “ssler” which could permit the attackers to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks on traffic going through vulnerable routers and allow them to intercept web traffic and insert malicious code into it. For further details see below. A new threat which targets a range of routers and network-attached storage (NAS) devices is capable of knocking out infected devices by rendering them unusable. The malware, known as VPNFilter, is unlike most other IoT threats because it is capable of maintaining a persistent presence on an infected device, even after a reboot. VPNFilter has a range of capabilities including spying on traffic being routed through the device. Its creators appear to have a particular interest in SCADA industrial control systems, creating a module which specifically intercepts Modbus SCADA communications. According to new research from Cisco Talos, activity surrounding the malware has stepped up in recent weeks and the attackers appear to be particularly interested in targets in Ukraine. While VPNFilter has spread widely, data from Symantec's honeypots and sensors indicate that unlike other IoT threats such as Mirai, it does not appear to be scanning and indiscriminately attempting to infect every vulnerable device globally. Q: What devices are known to be affected by VPNFilter? A: To date, VPNFilter is known to be capable of infecting enterprise and small office/home office routers from Asus, D-Link, Huawei, Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear, TP-Link, Ubiquiti, Upvel, and ZTE, as well as QNAP network-attached storage (NAS) devices. These include: Q: How does VPNFilter infect affected devices? A: Most of the devices targeted are known to use default credentials and/or have known exploits, particularly for older versions. There is no indication at present that the exploit of zero-day vulnerabilities is involved in spreading the threat. Q: What does VPNFilter do to an infected device? A: VPNFilter is a multi-staged piece of malware. Stage 1 is installed first and is used to maintain a persistent presence on the infected device and will contact a command and control (C&C) server to download further modules. Stage 2 contains the main payload and is capable of file collection, command execution, data exfiltration, and device management. It also has a destructive capability and can effectively “brick” the device if it receives a command from the attackers. It does this by overwriting a section of the device’s firmware and rebooting, rendering it unusable. There are several known Stage 3 modules, which act as plugins for Stage 2. These include a packet sniffer for spying on traffic that is routed through the device, including theft of website credentials and monitoring of Modbus SCADA protocols. Another Stage 3 module allows Stage 2 to communicate using Tor. A newly discovered (disclosed on June 6) Stage 3 module known as “ssler” is capable of intercepting all traffic going through the device via port 80, meaning the attackers can snoop on web traffic and also tamper with it to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Among its features is the capability to change HTTPS requests to ordinary HTTP requests, meaning data that is meant to be encrypted is sent insecurely. This can be used to harvest credentials and other sensitive information from the victim’s network. The discovery of this module is significant since it provides the attackers with a means of moving beyond the router and on to the victim’s network. A fourth Stage 3 module known as “dstr” (disclosed on June 6) adds a kill command to any Stage 2 module which lacks this feature. If executed, dstr will remove all traces of VPNFilter before bricking the device. Details on seven more Stage 3 modules were released on September 26, 2018. These include: “tcpvpn”: Allows establishment of a Reverse-TCP VPN on compromised devices, enabling remote attacker to access internal networks behind infected devices. Q: What should I do if I’m concerned my router is infected?Concerned users are advised to use Symantec's free online tool to help check if their router is impacted by VPNFilter. This also includes instructions on what to do if the router is infected. Q: What do the attackers intend to do with VPNFilter’s destructive capability? A: This is currently unknown. One possibility is using it for disruptive purposes, by bricking a large number of infected devices. Another possibility is more selective use to cover up evidence of attacks. Q: Do Symantec/Norton products (Win/Mac/NMS) protect against this threat? A: Symantec and Norton products detect the threat asLinux.VPNFilter. Acknowledgement:Symantec wishes to thank Cisco Talos and the Cyber Threat Alliance for sharing information on this threat in advance of publication. UPDATE:Netgear is advising customers that, in addition to applying the latest firmware updates and changing default passwords, users should ensure that remote management is turned off on their router. Remote management is turned off by default and can only be turned on using the router's advanced settings. To turn it off, they should go to www.routerlogin.net in their browser and log in using their admin credentials. From there, they should click \"Advanced\" followed by \"Remote Management\". If the check box for \"Turn Remote Management On\" is selected, clear it and click \"Apply\" to save changes. UPDATE May 24, 2018:TheFBI has announcedthat it has taken immediate action to disrupt the VPNFilter, securing a court order, authorizing it to seize a domain that is part of the malware's C&C infrastructure.Meanwhile, Linksys is advising customers to change administration passwords periodically and ensure software is regularly updated. If they believe they have been infected, a factory reset of their router is recommended.  Full instructions can be found here.MikroTik has said that it is highly certain that any of its devices infected by VPNFilter had the malware installed through a vulnerability in MikroTik RouterOS software, which was patched by MikroTik in March 2017. Upgrading RouterOS software deletes VPNFilter, any other third-party files and patches the vulnerability. UPDATE May 25, 2018:QNAP has published asecurity advisory on VPNFilter. It contains guidance on how to use the company’s malware removal tool to remove any infections.

    "content": "Two men have been found guilty of charges relating to the operation of Scan4You, a scanning service that allowed malware authors to check if their creations were detected by security products. The men were arrested overseas last year. Symantec assisted the case by testifying in court for the prosecution. Jurijs Martisevs pleaded guilty in March to charges of conspiracy and aiding and abetting computer intrusions.Ruslans Bondars was found guilty in a Virginia court yesterdayof conspiracy to violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act; conspiracy to commit wire fraud; and computer intrusion with intent to cause damage, and aiding and abetting. Sentencing is scheduled for September. The maximum penalties for conspiracy are five years in prison, a fine of $250,000, full restitution and forfeiture of any proceeds of the crime. The maximum penalties for computer intrusion are 10 years in prison, a fine of $250,000, full restitution and forfeiture of any proceeds of the crime. Scan4You ran from at least 2009 until 2016. Advertised on underground forums used by the cyber crime community, it was used by at least 30,000 customers. Bondars was responsible for the technical side of the service, maintaining its infrastructure and website. Martisevs took care of customer support, usually via email or instant messaging. The FBI investigation found that one Scan4You customer used the service to test malware that was then used to steal approximately 40 million credit and debit card numbers from a string of U.S. retailers. One retailer alone lost approximately $292 million from the attack. Scan4You was also used to develop the notorious Citadel financial Trojan which infected over 11 million victims worldwide and was used to steal over $500 million from victims. Symantec’s Vikram Thakur was called by the prosecution as an expert witness during the case. Thakur explained how legitimate malware scanning services work by analyzing submitted files and listing which security software vendors flag the file as malware and what they detect it as. After a file is scanned, the scan results are available to all vendors who subscribe to the service. This, Thakur said, was the crucial difference between legitimate services and their underground equivalents, whose results are shared with no one other than the person submitting the file. In order to run an underground malware scanning service, its operators would need to acquire security software from multiple vendors. Thakur told the court that use of Symantec products in any such service would be in violation of our End User License Agreement (EULA). “It’s important to distinguish between legitimate services, which allow the information security community to share information and protect customers, and illegal services which simply help malware authors try evade detection,” said Thakur. “Symantec is always happy to assist law enforcement agencies in prosecuting cyber crime.” Symantec's Security Response organization develops and deploys new security content to Symantec customers.

    "content": "Some of the key takeaways fromMarch’s Latest Intelligence, and the threat landscape in general, include an insight into what the Inception Framework group has been up to for the past three years, the email malware rate increases for the second month in a row, and malware that conducts browser-based cryptocurrency mining without a browser. Following a significant drop in January (1 in 786 emails, down from 1 in 431 the previous month), the email malware rate rose in February and that increase continued into March. However, the increase was slight, up to 1 in 635 emails, compared to 1 in 645 for February. The Mining sector continued to have the highest email malware rate, increasing from 1 in 461 emails in February to 1 in 308 for March. In March, Symantec discovered a new cryptocurrency mining malware (Trojan.Coinminer). However, this malware is not like most coinminers—it uses an interesting technique involving browser-based coin miningwithout any visible signs of a browser being used. One advantage of this type of threat for attackers is that coin mining may not be suspected for any CPU slowdown and instead the user may blame installed software for the problem. There was an increase in the rate of phishing emails in March, up from 1 in 3,331 emails in February to 1 in 2,981 in March.Agriculture, Forestry, & Fishingwas the sector with the highest rate in March, with 1 in 1,394 received emails being a phishing attempt. The cyber espionage group known as Inception Framework is using new types of lure documents in its spear-phishing campaigns and its malware has expanded to use new types of plugins,according to research published by Symantec in March. The group has remained active over the past three years, using cloud and the Internet of Things (IoT) to hide in plain sight. The group has been targeting organizations on several continents since 2014. It wasfirst exposed by Blue Coat (now part of Symantec) in December 2014targeting the Energy and Defense sectors, and organizations in the Consultancy/Security, Aerospace, Research, and Media sectors, in addition to embassies. However, the group appeared to fall quiet in late 2014 only to return in April 2015. Symantec has kept a close eye on the group’s activities, including changes in targeted regions. While there were no new Android malware families discovered in March, the threat to mobile devices is still as serious as ever. This is highlighted in this year’sISTR (volume 23), which shows that new mobile malware variants increased by 54 percent in 2017, andan average of 24,000 malicious mobile applications were blocked by Symantec every single day. Whenever there’s an event that generates interest online it’s inevitable that there will be scams trying to take advantage of the social media engagement that follows. This year’s Oscars ceremony was no exception and it wasn’t long beforebots began targeting the Twitter accounts of award winnersin order to spread gift card spam campaigns. The bots created fake accounts with similar handles to the real celebrities’ accounts. They then began replying to tweets in the real celebrities’ feeds. These replies contained spam links and were upvoted by other bot accounts so that the maximum number of people would see them. This is just a snapshot of the news for the month.

    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/coin-mining-without-browser",
    "content": "Browser-based cryptocurrency mining is making a lot of headlines recently and is affecting millions of users. This type of activity doesn’t take over your computer or steal your personal information, instead its goal is to use your CPU cycles to earn money. As covered in ourprevious cryptocurrency mining blog,browser-based mining activity exploded in the last few months of 2017. While this type of coin mining can be done in a legitimate way, where the user is informed and consent given for the mining taking place, it is illegitimate mining that concerns us. So far we’ve seen JavaScript and also WebAssembly (WASM) files being used for browser-based mining, but what’s next? How about browser-based coin mining that doesn’t involve a browser being opened? While this may sound strange, we recently came across a case where this method was being used. The case involved a portable executable file launching a web-based coinminer script to begin mining for cryptocurrency. Let’s take a closer look. The file in question is a .net executable file (0x231a3fbbc025c659be407c316aba4392f8a13915f08580398bca21082723dbf8), and .net executable files can contain various element to define different resources used by the executable. One of the resources defined within the resource section of this executable defines a user interface window (aka a form) named Form1. When we looked closer at the code that defines this form, we saw that it contained a script tag that references the Coinhive in-browser mining script, which is a clue to what this executable might do. Figure 1 shows that the JavaScript contains a reference to hxxps://coinhive[.]com/lib/miner.min.js and we already know that the Coinhive script is used for browser-based coin mining. This made us wonder what this JavaScript was doing in a PE file, so we dug a little deeper and found that it used some rather interesting techniques. The first thing we noticed after executing the file was that while mining was taking place and the Coinhive website was being visited, we didn’t see any browser running in the background. So how exactly is this JavaScript executed? This WebBrowser class enables the malware to navigate web pages inside the form and, as long as the form remains hidden, there will not be any visible cues that a browser is running. We can see in Figure 2 that a component resource manager is created of type Form1. We saw earlier how the Coinhive script is referenced in the code of Form1. The TextBox1.Text string of Form1 contains the JavaScript shown in Figure 1, which is responsible for the coin-mining activity. Also, a class named WebBrowser1 is created of WebBrowser class. This WebBrowser class enables the malware to navigate web pages inside the form and, as long as the form remains hidden, there will not be any visible cues that a browser is running. In Figure 3 we can see that the Webrowser1.DocumentText property of the WebBrowser class is given the value of TextBox1.Text, which is the JavaScript in the resource section responsible for coin mining. ThisDocumentTextproperty of theWebBrowserclass manipulates the contents of an HTML page displayed in theWebBrowsercontrol using string processing tools. This means that theNavigating,Navigated, andDocumentCompletedevents occur when this property is set, and the value of theURLproperty is no longer meaningful so will be ignored. Instead, the DocumentText property is loaded by the browser object which causes the coin-mining script to run. This gives the effect of running web browser based functionality but without a browser to be seen. To make sure that the mining restarts after each reboot, the originally executed PE file is also added to the Startup folder with the name windata0.exe. The usual tell-tale sign of browser-based coin mining is a sudden, unexpected and sustained ramp up in CPU activity. This usually manifests itself as sluggishness in the computer’s performance. When these symptoms are encountered while browsing the internet, a user might suspect that browser mining is taking place. But with an executable based browser miner, like the one discussed in this blog, the user won’t see any browser windows open so may not suspect the slowdown to be a symptom of coin mining and may, for example, blame installed software for the problem. However, using some simple tools allows us to see what’s responsible for maxing out the CPU. Using Windows Task Manager we can confirm the CPU load on the computer and, with some additional system analysis tools, we can see a number of network connections being made to coinhive.com, which confirms the presence of a miner using Coinhive scripts. We can also capture WebSocket traffic using network analysis tools and see the traffic sent between the miner and the server, which may include calculated hashes sent to the mining pool while the mining code is running. As already mentioned, browser-based miners became quite prevalent in the last few months of 2017. We can see the percentage change when looking at our network protection telemetry. Even with the recent large drops in cryptocurrency values since late January, incidents of browser-based cryptocurrency mining remains high. As we have seen in this blog, the criminals behind illegitimate mining continue to find new ways to highjack their victims’ processing power in order to enrich themselves. Symantec will continue to monitor their activities and respond in kind.

    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/istr-23-cyber-security-threat-landscape",
    "content": "Coin mining, ransomware, targeted attacks, mobile security, and attacks leveraging the software supply chain. These are just some of the topics that made headlines in infosec in 2017 and which are covered in ISTR 23, your comprehensive guide to the cyber security threat landscape, which isavailable to download now. The biggest trend in 2017 was the explosion in cryptocurrency coin mining. The surge in interest in this area was such that detections of coinminers on endpoint computers in 2017 surged by 8,500 percent. A coinminer is a file or script that is used to mine cryptocurrencies such as Monero. Cyber criminals started trying to make money this way primarily because there was a huge rise in the value of cryptocurrencies in the last quarter of 2017, making this type of cyber crime extremely profitable. Cyber criminals use coinminers to steal victims’ computer processing power and cloud CPU usage to mine cryptocurrencies. The barrier to entry for coin mining is pretty low—potentially only requiring a couple of lines of code to operate—and coin mining can allow criminals to fly under the radar in a way that is not possible with other types of cyber crime. Victims may not even realize a coinminer is slurping their computer’s power as the only impact may be a slowdown of their device that they could easily attribute to something else. However, coin mining on a device could potentially cause batteries to overheat and devices to become unusable. Coin mining also has implications for organizations. Self-propagating coinminers may require corporate networks to be shut down. Coin mining in the cloud also has financial implications for organizations that are being billed based on CPU usage. While malicious coinminers appear to thus far be primarily targeting computers, and mobile phones to some extent, as it evolves cyber criminals may increasingly target IoT devices. We observed a 600 percent increase in overall attacks on IoT devices in 2017, showing that while they didn’t make headlines like they did thanks to theMirai botnet in 2016, they are still very much a target for cyber criminals. Ransomware made headlines in 2017 thanks to theWannaCry ransomware(Ransom.WannaCry) andPetya/NotPetya(Ransom.Petya), which was a destructive wiper that masqueraded as a ransomware. However, these were not “typical” ransomware attacks, and both appear to have been the work of targeted attack groups, rather than typical cyber criminals. They were part of a new trend we have observed where ransomware is being used by targeted attack groups as a decoy, to cause disruption or, in the case of WannaCry, to try and generate revenue. The “traditional” cyber crime ransomware market made a “correction” in 2017, with fewer new ransomware families and lower ransom demands. Ransomware’s profitability in 2016 led to a crowded market and overpricing of ransom demands, but in 2017 cyber criminals seemed to find the sweet spot that victims are willing to pay. The average ransom demand in 2017 was $522, less than half of the average of 2016. Ransomware variants increased by 46 percent in 2017, which indicates that established cyber crime groups are still quite active, but there was a drop in the number of new families discovered. This may indicate less innovation on behalf of cyber criminals, and may be a sign that their focus is currently elsewhere. Some online banking threats experienced a renaissance in 2017 as ransomware groups sought to diversify, while many cyber criminals may also have focused on coin mining while cryptocurrency values were high. In this year’s ISTR we also examined the tools, tactics, and motivations of targeted attack groups. There are currently 140 targeted attack groups actively tracked by Symantec. We found that overall targeted attack activity increased by 10 percent in 2017, and the primary motive of 90 percent of groups was intelligence gathering. However, one-in-ten groups was also engaged in some kind of disruptive activity. Analysis also showed that the use of “living off the land” tools and techniques is still favored by many attack groups. The use of zero days continues to fall out of favor for many groups, with only 27 percent of the targeted attack groups known to Symantec having ever used zero days. There was an average of one supply chain attack every month in 2017, compared to four attacks annually in previous years. Somewhat related to this is another trend we observed in 2017: an increase in software update supply chain attacks. This attack type sees attackers inject malware implants into the supply chain to infect unsuspecting victims. This type of attack was the initial infection vector for the Petya/NotPetya malware, which used a Trojanized update for a Ukrainian accounting software to gain a foothold on corporate networks, before eventually spreading worldwide using the EternalBlue exploit and other methods. There was an average of one supply chain attack every month in 2017, compared to four attacks annually in previous years. These types of attacks allow attackers to infiltrate well protected networks by exploiting weaker links in their software supply chain. Threats on the mobile threat landscape continued to grow in 2017. New mobile malware variants increased by 54 percent, and an average of 24,000 malicious mobile applications were blocked every single day. The threat from grayware increased in 2017 as well. Grayware encompasses apps that aren’t entirely malicious but can be troublesome, and this type of threat increased by 20 percent compared to 2016. The challenge of ensuring mobile security is also exacerbated by the high percentage of devices, particularly Android devices, running outdated mobile operating systems. Only 20 percent of mobile devices are running the latest major release of Android, meaning 80 percent of devices are missing out on protections contained in that update.

    "content": "We’ve recently come across a new malicious behavior among apps infected withAndroid.Fakebank: interception of phone calls made by users to their banks. These apps are sourced from third-party Android markets and some social media sites. We’ve discovered 22 apps so far, targeting Korean bank clients. The Fakebank variants we’ve seen in the past usually collect bank SMS, record phone calls to banks, and display a fake bank login UI. This new variant, however, is able to intercept calls both incoming and outgoing. When the app is launched, it collects and submits user’s personal information to a command and control (C&C) server, and presents its display (Figure 1). The server will respond with configuration specifying the phone numbers that will be used in the scam (Figure 2). Four numbers are passed to the malware app: This allows the app to deceive users, when the configured phone numbers appear for an outgoing or incoming call: When users call a real banking phone number, the malware is able to intercept and transfer the call to the scammer’s configured phone number. When a call comes in from a scammer, the app will overlay a fake UI dialog that spoofs a legitimate bank caller ID and number. The APIs and associated permission used to carry out this deception (android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW) have evolved across Android versions. This malware optimizes its version targets to avoid requesting permissions from the user: In addition to tricking users into conversations with scammers, this malicious app sends call events to the C&C server. It also has a number of layouts customized to popular phone layouts in Korea. MitigationSymantec recommends users follow these best practices to stay protected from mobile threats: ProtectionSymantec and Norton products detect this malware asAndroid.Fakebank.

    "title": "inception framework hiding behind proxies",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/inception-framework-hiding-behind-proxies",
    "content": "The cyber espionage group known as the Inception Framework has significantly developed its operations over the past three years, rolling out stealthy new tools and cleverly leveraging the cloud and the Internet of Things (IoT) in order to make its activities harder to detect. Since 2014, Symantec has found evidence of a steady stream of attacks from the Inception Framework targeted at organizations on several continents. As time has gone by, the group has become ever more secretive, hiding behind an increasingly complex framework of proxies and cloud services. The Inception Framework has been active since at least May 2014 and its activities werefirst exposed by Blue Coat (now part of Symantec) in December 2014. Right from the start, the group stood out because of its use of an advanced, highly automated framework to support its targeted attacks. This level of sophistication is rarely seen, even in the targeted attacks sphere. The nature of Inception’s targets, from 2014 right through to today, along with the capabilities of its tools, indicate that espionage is the primary motive of this groups In 2014, Inception was compromising targeted organizations using spear-phishing emails, which masqueraded as legitimate emails concerning international policy, upcoming conferences, and specific sectoral interests of the targeted organization. More than half of the group’s earlier targets were in the Energy or Defense sectors, but it also targeted organizations in the Consultancy/Security, Aerospace, Research, and Media sectors, in addition to embassies. Its activities ranged across the globe, with targets located in South Africa, Kenya, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Suriname, along with several other European and Middle Eastern countries. Word documents attached to Inception’s spear-phishing emails leveraged two Microsoft Office vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-1761andCVE-2012-0158) to install malware on the recipient’s computer. The malware had a multi-staged structure that began with a malicious RTF document and ended with an in-memory DLL payload that communicated, via the WebDAV protocol, with a command and control (C&C) address from a legitimate cloud service provider (CloudMe.com). The name “Inception” comes from the group’s many levels of obfuscation and indirection it employed in delivering this payload. Further layers of obfuscation emerged when Blue Coat was able to determine that the attackers were communicating with CloudMe.com through a hacked network of compromised routers, the majority of which were located in South Korea. Following its exposure in late 2014, Inception fell quiet. However, this turned out to be only a brief hiatus and, by April 2015, there had been a resurgence in activity. Attacks have continued since then, right through to 2017. In the intervening years, the Inception Framework has evolved, adding additional layers of obfuscation in a bid to avoid detection. The group is using new types of lure documents in its spear-phishing campaigns and its malware has expanded to use new types of plugins. Inception has also increased its use of the cloud, and diversified the range of cloud providers it uses for C&C purposes. The locations of Inception’s targets have shifted since 2014, but the group continues to have a global reach. Russia accounted for the largest number of attacks between 2015 and 2017, followed by Ukraine, Moldova, Belgium, Iran, and France. Since 2014, the Inception Framework has steadily changed its tools and techniques. In its early attacks, the group’s malware payload (with the exception of plugins) was fully contained within an exploit document emailed to the victim. In more recent activity, these spear-phishing attacks are now a two-stage process. The group will first email the target a malicious “Reconnaissance document” which, if opened, willfingerprint the target computer, gathering information on what software it is running and whether that software is up to date. Several days later, Inception will send a second spear-phishing email to the target, with another malicious document attached. This document is designed to retrieve a remote RTF file, which contains the exploit, and open it on the target’s computer. Shortly after this RTF document is opened, the remaining stages of the Inception malware are found executing on the system. The loader DLL is responsible for decrypting and injecting the core payload DLL into memory, from an encrypted file present on disk. The core payload DLL's main function is to gather system information, execute other malware in the form of plugins, and update itself. It accesses C&C via WebDAV hosted on legitimate cloud storage providers. The use of an initial reconnaissance document allows Inception to profile the target’s computer and potentially customize any subsequent malicious document to exploit known vulnerabilities in unpatched software on the computer. By breaking its attacks up into distinct stages, Inception also makes them harder to detect. For investigators to trace an attack, each stage will have be uncovered and referenced to the other stages. Inception’s malware is modular and the attackers will load plugins based on requirements for each attack. The group has used a range of plugins in recent attacks, some of which are improved versions of plugins used in 2014, while others were previously unseen. Since 2014, Inception has widened its use of cloud service providers for C&C purposes. Whereas previously it relied on one service provider (CloudMe.com), more recently it has employed a least five cloud service providers Leveraging the cloud for C&C has a number of advantages for groups like Inception. Any C&C communications will involve encrypted traffic to a known website, meaning it is less likely to raise flags on targeted networks. Legitimate cloud services are not likely to be blacklisted. Varying the cloud service provider used adds a further degree of stealth. Once it became known Inception was using a single provider, any traffic to that provider may have attracted additional scrutiny. Symantec has notified all cloud providers affected. Where possible Symantec has provided details on the C&C accounts used by Inception to the affected cloud providers. The accounts in questions have been deleted or disabled. Inception is continuing to use chains of infected routers to act as proxies and mask communications between the attackers and the cloud service providers they use. Certain router manufacturers have UPnP listening on WAN as a default configuration. Akamai research has found that there are 765,000 devices vulnerable to this attack. These routers are hijacked by Inception and configured to forward traffic from one port to another host on the internet. Abuse of this service requires no custom malware to be injected on the routers and can be used at scale very easily. Inception strings chains of these routers together to create multiple proxies to hide behind. Every connection builds different chains of infected routers and once the connection is complete, it cleans up after itself. In several cases, Symantec has been able to follow the entire chain of compromised routers and found it led to a virtual private server (VPS), meaning the attackers have employed an additional layer of security by routing communications through rented hosting servers. Inception has an ongoing interest in mobile devices and has previously developed malware to infect Android (Android.Lastacloud), iOS (IOS.Lastaccoud) and BlackBerry devices (BBOS.Lastacloud). Mobile malware continues to be deployed and the group has made some modifications to its Android malware. The malware is spread via SMS messages and emails containing malicious links. Once installed, it uses user profile pages on online forums as dead drops for its C&C. Even prior to its discovery in 2014, Inception went to great lengths both to avoid detection and conceal its location. Exposure hasn’t deterred the group. Instead, it has redoubled its efforts, adding more layers of obfuscation to an already complex attack framework. Its persistence, stealth, and global reach mean the group continues to pose an ongoing risk to organizations, particularly in its areas of interest, which include defense, aerospace, energy, governments, telecoms, media, and finance. Aside from a suite of advanced modular malware, the group is notable for its ability to make use of new platforms such as the cloud, IoT, and mobile to facilitate its attacks. An “early adopter”, Inception’s tactics may point the way towards how other espionage groups may modify their methods in years to come. Symantec has had protection for all of the Inception Framework tools since the initial emergence of the group in 2014.  The following detections are in place today: File-based protection Network Protection Products Customers with Webpulse-enabled products are protected against activity associated with Inception The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "content": "Some of the key takeaways fromFebruary’s Latest Intelligence, and the threat landscape in general, include the Chafer attack group mounts further operations against targets in the Middle East, the email malware rate remains low, and a mobile threat attempts to log into Facebook accounts to steal credentials. After a significant drop last month, the email malware rate rose again in February. However, at 1 in 645 emails, the current rate is still quite a bit lower than what was generally seen in the second half of 2017. This is likely due to lower levels of email activity by the Necurs botnet, little of which served up malware during February. The Chafer attack group has been observed carrying out further operations against organizations in the Middle East, according tonew research by Symantec. The group has been seen working its way further into targets in the telecom and transport industries, using new tools to traverse the networks, primarily to carry out surveillance activities. This recent activity indicates that the group remains highly active, working to hone its tools and tactics. The global spam rate declined slightly in February, dropping to 55.1 percent. However, the rate remains above 55 percent, as it has for 6 of the last 7 months. The Finance, Insurance, & Real Estate sector tops our list of industry spam rates, while last month’s top sector, Mining, dropped to fifth place. While quiet on the email malware front, there were a couple large spam runs sent by the Necurs botnet during the month. The first run was a continuation of a run we mentioned last month:a classic fake romance-themed scam, using a simple subject line of “hi”. This scam continued into February and the lead-up to Valentine’s Day, offering the semblance of a romantic encounter in order to scam the user. Hi [YOUR EMAIL HANDLE], My name is [RANDOM NAME] and i'm writing you to tell you that you are super cute from your photos on Facebook. I myself am from Russia, but now I live in the USA. I want to get to know you more! If you have the same, email me, this is my email [PREDETERMINED DOMAIN]. Lets know each other better. The second major Necurs campaign came later in the month and contained an attached PDF with advertisements for online pharmaceuticals. The subject lines were a random “Offer”, “Discount”, “Sale”, “Coupon”, or “Final sale”, followed by a random 7- to 9-digit number. The phishing rate dropped in February, coming in at 1 in 3,331 emails. While slightly lower than January, overall rates have hovered in the 1 in 2,000-3,000 range for the last 10 months. The Agriculture, Forestry, & Fishing sector had the highest industry phishing rate with 1 in 1,854 emails, followed by Retail Trade at 1 in 2,505 emails. A phishing scam mimicking a customer service notice from Netflix has been making the rounds, attempting totrick recipients into divulging personally identifiable informationsuch as credit card numbers. The phishing emails attempt to trick a user into believing their Netflix membership will be suspended if they do not validate their billing information. Manual sharing topped social media scams in February, comprising 62.78 percent of scams, while Fake Offers dropped more than 10 percentage points, from 29.75 percent to 19.49 percent. Coming in third for February, Like Jacking increased 1.29 percentage points at 17.25 percent. A newly discovered version of the Fakeapp Android malware familyhas been discovered by Symantec researchersattempting to log into Facebook accounts in order to steal user names and passwords, as well as a variety of personal details available in the user’s profile. The threat gains access to the user’s account by displaying a fake login page once it has compromised the device. The threat will periodically display this message until the user credentials or the threat is removed. This is just a snapshot of the news for the month.

    "title": "chafer latest attacks reveal heightened ambitions",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/chafer-latest-attacks-reveal-heightened-ambitions",
    "content": "Chafer, the Iran-based targeted attack group, mounted further operations throughout 2017, attacking more organizations in the Middle East and beyond, and deploying several new tools. The group staged a number of ambitious new attacks last year, including the compromise of a major telecoms services provider in the region. There is also evidence that it attempted to attack a major international travel reservations firm. Chafer appears to be primarily engaged in surveillance and tracking of individuals, with most of its attacks likely carried out to gather information on targets or facilitate surveillance. Chafer has been active since at least July 2014 and its activitieswere first exposed by Symantec in December 2015, when it was found to be conducting targeted surveillance of domestic and international targets. At the time, many of its targets were individuals located in Iran, and it had already begun compromising telecom providers as well as airline companies in the Middle East region. Chafer appears to have been undeterred by its exposure in 2015 and continued to be very active during 2017, using seven new tools, rolling out new infrastructure, and attacking nine new target organizations in the region. The group hit organizations in Israel, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Sectors targeted included airlines; aircraft services; software and IT services companies serving the air and sea transport sectors; telecoms services; payroll services; engineering consultancies; and document management software. Outside of the Middle East, Symantec has also found evidence of attacks against one African airline and attempts to compromise an international travel reservations firm. One of the organizations compromised by Chafer in 2017 was a telecoms services provider in the Middle East, which sells its solutions to multiple telecoms operators in the region. The ultimate goal of the attack may have been to facilitate surveillance of end-user customers of telecoms operators. By moving two steps up the supply chain the attackers could potentially have carried out surveillance on a vast pool of end-users. Alongside evidence of compromise of the organization itself, Symantec also found a copy of one of the company’s own files, relating to its messaging software, on a staging server used by Chafer. The file was in a directory alongside a number of hacking tools used by the attackers. A second target outside the Middle East provides further confirmation of Chafer’s heightened ambitions in recent times. Symantec found evidence that it had tried to compromise a large international travel reservations firm. There was no indication that the attack was successful, but Chafer did successfully infiltrate an African airline that is a customer of the reservations firm. The group hit organizations in Israel, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Sectors targeted included airlines; aircraft services; software and IT services companies serving the air and sea transport sectors; telecoms services; payroll services; engineering consultancies; and document management software. In the earlier attacks from 2015, Symantec found evidence that Chafer had been compromising targeted organizations by attacking their web servers, likely through SQL injection attacks, in order to drop malware onto them. In 2017, the group added a new infection method to its toolkit, using malicious documents which are likely circulated using spear-phishing emails sent to individuals working in targeted organizations. These documents were Excel spreadsheets. When opened, they downloaded a malicious VBS file that in turn ran a PowerShell script. Several hours later, a dropper would appear on the compromised computer. This would install three files on the computer, an information stealer, a screen capture utility, and an empty executable. The screen capture utility appeared to be used for initial information gathering, as it was only used briefly at the beginning of each infection and not seen again. The information stealer was capable of stealing the contents of the clipboard, taking screenshots, recording keystrokes and stealing files and user credentials. After this initial activity, the attackers usually downloaded more of their tools to the computer using a PowerShell downloader and began moving across the victim’s network. Symantec has seen Chafer use seven new tools in its more recent campaigns, in addition to malware it is previously known to have used. Most of the new tools are freely available, off-the-shelf tools, put to a malicious use. The new tools include: Chafer has also continued to use tools previously associated with the group, including its own custom backdoor Remexi (Backdoor.Remexi); the aforementioned PsExec; Mimikatz (Hacktool.Mimikatz), a free tool capable of changing privileges, exporting security certificates, and recovering Windows passwords in plaintext; Pwdump (Pwdump) a tool that is used to grab Windows password hashes from a remote Windows computer; and Plink (PuTTY Link) a command-line utility used to create reverse SSH sessions. Chafer has used these tools in concert to traverse targeted networks. The group has recently adopted NSSM to maintain persistence and install the service which runs Plink on the compromised computer. Plink is then used to open reverse SSH sessions from the attacker's server to the RDP port on the victim computer. This presumably gives them RDP access to the compromised computer. Once a foothold is established, the attackers use PsExec, Remcom, and SMB hacking tools to begin moving across the victim’s network. Chafer has also begun using new infrastructure. The domain win7-updates[.]com is being used by the group as a command and control address. The domain has been referenced several times in command lines, e.g: It has also been embedded in a dropper: Symantec also discovered multiple IP addresses that were used as infrastructure by the attackers. It is unclear whether these were leased or hijacked, but the fact that many of them appear to follow a pattern—with the latter three numbers of each address often running in sequence—makes it likely they were deliberately selected by the attackers. In one case, Symantec found what appeared to be a staging server used by the attackers. The server belonged to one of the targeted organizations. Copies of many of the tools used by the group were discovered on the server. The attackers didn’t even bother hiding their activity and saved items to the desktop, often without renaming them. Chafer’s activities have some links to another group known as Crambus (aka Oilrig). Both groups have been observed using the same IP address for command and control purposes. In addition to this, both groups have been seen using a similar infection vector, namely an Excel document which drops a malicious VBS file. Both VBS files reference the same file path, containing the same misspelling: Are the two groups one and the same? While this may be a possibility, at present there isn’t enough evidence to support that hypothesis. What is more likely is that the two groups are known to each other and enjoy access to a shared pool of resources. Chafer’s recent activities indicate that the group remains highly active, is continuing to hone its tools and tactics, and has become more audacious in its choice of targets. Although a regional actor, the group has followed two trends seen globally among targeted attack groups. The first is a greater reliance on freely available software tools, also known as “living off the land.” By limiting their use of malware, groups such as Chafer hope to be less conspicuous on a victim’s network and, if discovered, make their attack more difficult to attribute. The second trend is towards attacks on the supply chain, compromising organizations with the goal of then attacking the customers, or even the customers of the customers, of those organizations. These attacks require more “steps” to reach their ultimate target, which adds additional time and risk for attackers to reach their targets.  However these attacks also leverage trusted channels into the eventual target, e.g., through a trusted supplier, allowing attackers to potentially circumvent security systems at the organization they ultimately wish to compromise. These attacks are riskier but come with a potentially higher reward and, if successful, could give the attackers access to a vast pool of potential targets. Chafer’s recent activities indicate that the group remains highly active, is continuing to hone its tools and tactics, and has become more audacious in its choice of targets. Although a regional actor, the group has followed two trends seen globally among targeted attack groups.

    "content": "Recently, there have beenreportsof mobile threats stealing Facebook login credentials, such as user names and passwords. We’ve encountered new Android malware (detected asAndroid.Fakeapp) that takes a more aggressive approach: logging into Facebook accounts and harvesting account details directly from victims’ devices. The majority of the victims are located in the Asia-Pacific region. The malware we’ve encountered was sourced from third-party markets. The apps target English speakers. Once installed, the malicious app immediately hides itself from the home screen, leaving only a service running in the background. This service takes the following steps to steal details from a Facebook user’s account: Using JavaScript from a hidden WebView, the threat silently logs into the compromised Facebook account. The malware hides the WebView by setting the display to be almost completely transparent (Figure 2). It then ensures that a CAPTCHA isn’t presented. If it is, it sends the event to the C&C server, clears caches and cookies, and retries later. Once the malware is logged into the Facebook page, it can leverage a wide range of capabilities to follow links and scrape the personal data of the victim and their friends, sending it back to the C&C server. This includes: The functionality that crawls the Facebook page has a surprising level of sophistication. The crawler has the ability to use the search functionality on Facebook and collect the results. Additionally, to harvest information that is shown using dynamic web techniques, the crawler will scroll the page and pull content via Ajax calls (Figures 4 and 5). MitigationWe advise users to follow these best practices to stay protected from mobile threats: ProtectionSymantec and Norton products detect this malware asAndroid.Fakeapp. Martin is a member of Symantec’s Security Technology and Response team who are focused on providing round-the-clock protection against current and future cyber threats.

Of the two, Meltdown poses the greatest threat because it is easier to exploit and affects all kinds of computers, including personal computers and virtual machines in the cloud. Symantec is not aware of either vulnerability being exploited in the wild. The vulnerabilities are significant, since a successful exploit could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, including passwords. However, exploit of any vulnerable computer would require an attacker to gain access to the targeted computer via a prior step, such as running a malicious application on it; through JavaScript which triggers an exploit in order to run as native code; or running JavaScript to map the kernel. All of these malicious activities can be blocked by Symantec products. Nevertheless, users are advised to apply operating system patches as soon as they are made available. Both Meltdown and Spectre exploit flaws in processors in order to bypass memory isolation in the operating system. Operating systems are designed in a way to block one application from accessing memory being used by another. If memory isolation fails to work, a malicious application could steal information from memory being used by other applications. Meltdown (CVE-2017-5754) exploits a flaw in out-of-order execution, a performance feature found in many modern processor chips. The researchers who discovered it have confirmed that it affects every Intel processor since 1995 (with the exception of pre-2013 Intel Itanium and Intel Atom processors). However, they added that it remains unclear whether ARM and AMD processors are also affected by the vulnerability. If successfully exploited, an attacker can obtain a copy of the entire kernel address space, including any mapped physical memory, in other words, any data stored in memory at the time of the attack. Meltdown can be exploited regardless of the operating system a computer is running. It affects both individual computers and any computers hosting cloud services, meaning an attack on a single server could lead to the compromise of multiple virtual machines running on that server. Exploitation against cloud services is potentially the most worrying scenario, since the Meltdown can be exploited on a virtual machine in order to access memory from the host machine. Attackers could potentially buy space on a vulnerable cloud service and use it to stage an attack against other customers using the same host. Spectre (CVE-2017-5753andCVE-2017-5715) has a similar outcome but works in a slightly different way, and exploits a flaw in processor design to trick an application into leaking information stored in memory. According to the team who discovered Spectre, virtually all modern processors are affected by the vulnerability, including Intel, AMD, and ARM chips. Once again, the vulnerability is operating system agnostic. Users are advised to apply operating system patches immediately. Patches have already been released forMicrosoft Windows,Apple macOS, andLinuxto patch Meltdown. Spectre is reportedly more difficult to patch but also more difficult to exploit. Work is underway to harden software against any potential exploits. Operating system vendors have already warned that patching is likely to have a performance impact on affected computers. According to Microsoft, the impact may not be noticeable on most consumer devices, however the specific impact “varies by hardware generation and implementation by the chip manufacturer.” The developers of the Linux patch said average performance could decline by 5 percent, but instances of a 30 percent decline were observed.

    "content": "While analyzing the most recentAndroid.Fakeappmalware variants, we came across a sample that was using a quite novel and different monetization technique, in addition to the regular overlay tricks asking users to enter their credit card details. This one would be of particular concern to Uber users on Android, which number in the millions worldwide. The Fakeapp variant we found had a spoofed Uber application user interface (UI) which pops up on the user’s device screen in regular intervals until the user gets tricked into entering their Uber ID (typically the registered phone number) and password. Figure 1 shows the fake Uber app UI displayed by the malware to get the user to enter their details. Once the user clicks the Next button (->), the malware sends the user ID and password to its remote server. Next, the malware tries to cover up the heist. To avoid alarming the user, the malware displays a screen of the legitimate app that shows the user’s current location, which would not normally arouse suspicion because that’s what’s expected of the actual app. This is where creators of this Fakeapp variant got creative. To show the said screen, the malware uses the deep link URI of the legitimate app that starts the app’s Ride Request activity, with the current location of the victim preloaded as the pickup point. To show the said screen, the malware uses the deep link URI of the legitimate app that starts the app’s Ride Request activity, with the current location of the victim preloaded as the pickup point. Deep links are URLs that take users directly to specific content in an app. Deep linking in Android is a way to identify a specific piece of content or functionality inside an app. It is much like a web URL, but for applications. For example, the Uber app has the following deep link URI for its Ride Request activity: Figure 3 illustrates the code snippet of the malware that fires the VIEW intent with the Ride Request deep link URI after exfiltrating the Uber credentials to its remote server. This case again demonstrates malware authors’ neverending quest for finding new social engineering techniques to trick and steal from unwitting users.

    "title": "browser mining cryptocurrency",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/browser-mining-cryptocurrency",
    "content": "Browser-based cryptocurrency mining activity exploded in the last few months of 2017. After many years of deathly silence, the catalyst appears to be the launch of a new browser-based mining service in September by Coinhive. This service wraps everything up nicely in an easy-to-use package for website owners and has injected new life into an idea that was long thought of as dead and buried. Browser-based mining, as its name suggests, is a method of cryptocurrency mining that happens inside a browser and is implemented using scripting language. This is different compared to the more widely known file-based cryptocurrency mining approach which involves downloading and running a dedicated executable file. Browser-based mining dates back to May of 2011 when an innovative service called BitcoinPlus.com was initially launched—back when Bitcoin was cheap and mining was easy—not to be confused with another cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin Plus.org (XBC). That service was in many ways remarkably similar to its modern reincarnation, Coinhive. It used JavaScript code for pooled mining and website owners could sign up to the service and embed these scripts into their web pages to make page visitors mine for them. The big difference is that back in 2011 BitcoinPlus.com, as its name suggests, mined for Bitcoin (BTC) whereas the current browser-based miners like Coinhive are mining for Monero (XMR)—a newer, privacy-focused cryptocurrency. Back in 2011, before theadvent of ASIC mining in 2013, Bitcoin was still in its infancy,mining difficultywas relatively low, and cryptocurrency prices were even lower. It was (just about) possible to do some mining with home-grade hardware. Even though it was possible at that time to mine for Bitcoin via BitcoinPlus.com, the reality of the situation was that it was largely a futile exercise. The reward was minuscule compared to the amount of mining power and electricity required. Of course, this was back in the days before Bitcoin prices shot through the roof—in June 2011, Bitcoin reached the then lofty heights of almost US$30. Due to this fundamental profitability problem with browser-based mining, it soon withered away. However, the idea was once again revived in December 2013 by a group of MIT students in a project called Tidbit—ostensibly touted as an alternative way for website owners to raise revenue. Once again, this project didn’t last long, as soon after it started the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs stepped in to investigate the fledgling company on charges of unlawful access to \"a person’s computer processing power.\" This resulted ina long drawn out case which was finally settled in 2015. The case for browser-based mining wasn’t looking good. The growing problem of profitability was made even worse by the increasing use of ASIC miners. The advent of ASIC miners dragged bitcoin mining out of the realm of home users and into an industrial age dominated by the massive mining farms that we are more familiar with today. After the demise of Tidbit, the idea of browser-based JavaScript cryptocurrency mining largely died away once again. Despite these setbacks, key lessons were learned. The point of a service like Tidbit was never about single servers or high-end computers doing solo mining. The true power of this service came from scaling up and pooling the potentially massive combined mining power of masses of users with average hardware visiting a website. Higher website traffic means higher returns and sooner or later, somebody was bound to figure out a better way to get browser mining to work on end users' computers more efficiently. Fast forward to September 2017, the cryptocurrency landscape compared with 2013 had changed drastically.In April 2013, the cryptocurrency market only had a handful of coins and the total market capitalization was just $1.5 billion. The market for cryptocurrency was extremely limited and illiquid, meaning that even if you got some, it was not easy to turn it back into fiat currency for spending. Contrast that withSeptember 2017 when the market capitalization stood at an incredible $166billion spread over more than a thousand different coins. Together with the diversity of coins to choose from in 2017, there was also now a diversity of coin reward mechanisms. Some, like Bitcoin, can still only be mined via a proof-of-work (PoW) process using dedicated power-hungry ASIC hardware—though there have been attempts to change this, with the various hard forks such as Bitcoin Gold (BTG) and Bitcoin Diamond (BCD), to bring in GPU mining. Other cryptocurrencies like Monero, Ethereum (ETH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), and Dash (DASH) can be mined using retail-grade GPU hardware found in many home computers. There are also some that are more suited to CPU mining; these include Monero and Verium Reserve (VRM). The trading environment is massively different too; it’s now much easier to move between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, making the latter more useful and valuable. It's against this backdrop that Coinhive released its browser-mining scripts designed to mine Monero, effectively bringing the idea of browser-based mining back from the dead. Coinhive is marketed as an alternative to browser ad revenue. The motivation behind this is simple: users pay for the content indirectly by coin mining when they visit the site and website owners don't have to bother users with sites laden with ads, trackers, and all the associated paraphernalia being downloaded to the browser. Users hopefully then get a cleaner, faster, and potentially less risky website (remember malvertising?) to use, and everybody is happy. What could go wrong? Soon after the release of the Coinhive service, the hash rate for the service started to climb, and quickly too. Hash rate is the number of hashes calculated by the combined power of the mining pool and is measured in the number of hashes per second—usually in units of millions (MH/s). Hashing is the process of carrying out cryptographic hash calculations which are used to help process transactions. Miners who participate in a mining pool get paid a share of income generated by the pool. According to a blog by Coinhive, the hash rate for their pool climbed from 0 MH/s to 3 MH/s in a couple of days before reaching 13.5 MH/s in the space of a week. To put that into perspective, the total network hash rate (the total amount of mining power for all computers mining) for Monero stood at around 260 MH/s on September 20, 2017. The Coinhive pool reached just over five percent of that total which is quite an achievement in such a short time. Monero can be mined with CPUs and GPUs, but the Coinhive browser-based mining service only works for CPU mining which is a limitation that substantially reduces potential returns. To maximize revenue, the script is best placed on high-traffic websites and \"sticky\" websites (where users stay on the same page for longer). According to one early adopter,the revenue generated by his particular site was far lower than the revenue generated from ads. In fairness to Coinhive, it recommends being transparent with site visitors and that website owners notify users of the mining that will be taking place and, better still, offer users a way to opt in. Unfortunately, despite Coinhive’s best intentions, unscrupulous operators quickly latched on to the idea of secret mining in the hope that users will not notice. The first high-profile site to start using Coinhive mining was The Pirate Bay torrent website. The Pirate Bay has had a checkered history and, being a highly trafficked site (global ranking #161 with 290 million visitors in the last six months), has been looking for alternative ways to monetize its considerable traffic. Its initial attempts at browser mining were quickly spotted by users and they were not too happy about it. At least in the case of The Pirate Bay, this was a case of the site's owners making a decision to use Coinhive. The Pirate Bay's initial attempts at browser mining were quickly spotted by users and they were not too happy about it. The Pirate Bay was soon followed by another high-profile site—this time Coinhive's miner wasfound on two of Showtime's websites. One of the Showtime sites affected was its content streaming site which has high traffic and user sessions are lengthy as visitors stay on the site while content is streaming. Showtime is a premium-based service so it would seem strange that users are made to pay twice for content. The scripts were promptly removed after they were discovered, suggesting that they were planted there maliciously. Reports of many other sites using the Coinhive mining scripts soon followed. Over the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S.,the Coinhive miner was also found in a LiveHelpNow widgetwhich is used by many websites around the world to offer in-browser support chat sessions. The apparent cause of this was the compromise of one of the CDN servers used by LiveHelpNow to serve up its widget. As with Showtime, LiveHelpNow is already a legitimate revenue-generating business and there's no obvious reason as to why it would risk user confidence to earn a few extra bucks from users. So the most likely scenario is that the server was compromised either by an outsider, or even an insider. Browser mining is cropping up in many other different places too: There are many reasons why browser-based mining is back with a vengeance. Unlike in previous failed attempts, recent developments in the cryptocurrency and threat landscapes have made this a much more viable activity. Let's have a look at some of these factors in more detail: Privacy is important if you want to mine coins maliciously, in order to ensure others cannot easily follow the money trail back to you. Monero, which came to the market in 2014, can offer a high level of transaction privacy. Unlike with most other cryptocurrencies that use public transparent blockchains where transaction addresses can be easily viewed by anyone, Monero does things differently. By default, everything is private, including the amount in a transaction, who sent it, and who received it. There is an option with whichwallet owners can selectively reveal some information via what's called a view key, but this is not a feature that cyber criminals are likely to want to use. As mentioned earlier, Coinhive provides a very neat and easy-to-use package for people to get involved in Monero mining. All you have to do is add a few lines of script to your website code. You don't have to make website visitors download and install executable files. The mining process can start quickly and quietly in the browser without anybody noticing, unless insufficient throttling is used, in which case the CPU load may max out during the users' session which would be an easy tell-tale for end users to spot. CPU load may max out during the users' session which would be an easy tell-tale for end users to spot. Even with the price of Monero reaching over $300 recently, given the current network hash power of the network at around 300 MH/s, profitable mining is a game of scale and requires a careful eye on costs. With browser-based mining, the cost of mining is borne mostly by the website visitors through hardware wear and tear as well as energy costs. Scale is achieved by using high-traffic sites with sticky content. Coinhive currently pays 0.000104 XMR ($0.025) for every million hashes. Take for example a user of a PC with a mid-range Intel i7-7700K CPU which is capable of pushing out around 300 H/s. The user would have to spend 3,333 seconds on the site, or roughly 55 minutes, in order to achieve a million hashes. However, if you can get 3,333 users to spend approximately one second each on the site it would achieve a similar result. Even under optimal conditions, the amount of hashes produced in each instance will be small, but when it comes to distributed computing power, it's all about scale and every little bit adds up. As we noted earlier, the value of mining rewards are not great, at least not initially. To get a better understanding, we need to look at the profitability of this activity over the longer term and take in the macroeconomic picture to get a true sense of the reward. The value of cryptocurrencies like Monero is going up dramatically. So far in 2017, the price has gone from $13 to over $300. Under these circumstances where the price of Monero can go up substantially in dollar terms over a relatively short time, mining Monero can become an attractive proposition. A small amount of Monero mined today could potentially be worth a great deal more in a matter of months (conversely it could also drop significantly depending on the health of the overall cryptocurrency economy). Mirroring the rising interest and price of cryptocurrency, we have also seen a big jump in our detections of both file- and browser-based cryptocurrency mining activity in recent months. Malicious cryptocurrency mining isn't just confined to desktop computers and servers. Always-connected mobile devices are also a growing target. We have even seen growth in coin mining on mobile phones in recent years. In 2016, we discovered 26 different Android apps that were mining cryptocurrencies. So far in 2017 we have found 35, which is around a 34 percent increase. Modern mobile phones have processors that can beas powerful as low- to mid-range desktop computerswhich help to make mobile mining more viable. But cryptocurrency mining is always an energy-intensive activity so the biggest problem facing mobile mining is of course battery drain as battery technology has not progressed as fast as processing power. Mobile mining will inevitably be noticed by the heat generated and the fast-draining battery, not to mention any performance impacts that it may also have on the device. If we consider the cryptocurrency market as whole, we can see that just as the total value of cryptocurrencies increased manifold during the year, interest in malicious mining activity, both browser- and executable-based as indicated by detections of malicious mining activity, increased in tandem with it. As interest increases, more participants, both as miners and tool makers, join the fray. Coinhive, while being the best known at this time, doesn't have the market to itself. Similar projects like Crypto Loot are cropping up, and other browser mining projects like JSEcoin have been in beta since August 2017 and are trying to generate growth in this activity. Symantec has observed a significant jump in all cryptocurrency mining activity in recent months as evidenced in our increasing detection rate (See Figures 4 and 5). Despite the genuine aspirations of most browser mining projects to offer a real and potentially better alternative to traditional web revenue generation methods, the sad reality is, it can and is being misused. Increasing user awareness and detection by security vendors will trigger a new arms race between cyber criminals and defenders. Recent innovations in the malicious use of browser-based mining scripts, such as the\"pop-under\" techniquewhere browser mining takes place in a hidden browser window, are a sign of this in action. We can expect to see adoption of a wide range of traditional malware propagation and evasion techniques to help spread and prolong mining activity in order to maximize profit. For as long as the current enabling factors are in place making it favorable for mining, we can expect to see interest in browser mining to be sustained or even increase in the short to medium term. Symantec is keeping a watchful eye on the growing trend of browser mining. We are making adjustments as necessary to prevent unwanted cryptocurrency miners from stealing your computing resources to enrich others. Website owners should watch for injection of the browser-mining scripts into their website source code. Our network solutions can help you spot this in the network traffic as your server communicates with visitors. In addition, file system scans can also show up any files where the browser-based miner code has been injected, enabling you to identify and clean up the content. Symantec helps prevent others from stealing your computing resources by protecting various stages of the attack chain: All mining software, whether it is file- or browser-based, must be able to connect to either the cryptocurrency network or a mining pool to exchange data, in other words its proof-of-work. Without this connection, it cannot get the data it needs to generate hashes, rendering it useless. We can also block the mining scripts from being downloaded in the first instance. Our network protection operates on our endpoint solutions as well as our gateway and cloud touch points; all these solutions help build a solid defense against unwanted mining activity. Here are some of the network protection signatures geared towards detection of browser-based mining: Our endpoint solutions, including those for mobile devices, can detect and block all types of mining activity whether they are file-based or in-browser. These solutions can prevent mining software from installing or running in the first instance. Browser-based mining scripts are detected asPUA.JScoinminer.

    "content": "Symantec is aware of a new Trojan which targets industrial control systems (ICS) and has the potential to cause severe disruption at any targeted organization. Triton (Trojan.Trisis), is designed to communicate with a specific type of ICS, namely safety instrumented systems (SIS) and deploy alternative logic to these devices, meaning they may not function correctly. Triton has reportedly been used against at least one organization in the Middle East. Triton, which has been in existence since at least August 2017, works by infecting a Windows computer that is expected to be connected to a SIS device.The malware then injects code modifying the behavior of the SIS device. However, at present the intended effect is unclear and investigation is still underway. Safety instrumented systems are a type of industrial control system designed to monitor the performance of critical systems and take remedial action should an unsafe condition be detected. This could include overly high temperatures or pressure readings in industrial systems. The SIS is designed to detect such conditions and initiate action that will put the affected systems into a safe state. Attacks on SIS devices could potentially cause disruption at a targeted organization and, at worst, facilitate sabotage. By interfering with the operation of an SIS, an attacker could cause it to malfunction and shutdown operations at a plant. A worst case scenario is an attack where an SIS malfunctions, does not detect an unsafe event and therefore fails to prevent an industrial accident. The latter would be more difficult to accomplish since the attacker would need to ensure an unsafe condition occurs while the SIS is malfunctioning. While there have been a small number previous cases of malware designed to attack ICS, Triton is the first to attack SIS devices. The first and most notable example of ICS malware was Stuxnet (W32.Stuxnet) which wasdesigned to attack programmable logic controllers (PLCs)being used in the Iranian uranium enrichment program. The Dragonfly cyber espionage grouphas also been known to target ICSand previously compromised a number of ICS equipment providers, infecting their software with the Oldrea Trojan (Backdoor.Oldrea) (aka Havex). More recently, the Disakil disk-wiping malware (Trojan.Disakil), which wasused in attacks against the Ukrainian energy sector in late 2016, contained a component designed to target SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) ICS systems. The malware attempted to stop and delete a service used by software designed to communicate with legacy SCADA systems. Triton appears to be designed to be used in a highly targeted fashion, meaning it is possible the attackers may be focused on one specific target or a small number of targets. Nevertheless, users of SIS devices are advised to review operational security and follow the manufacturer’s best practices, such as ensuring safety systems are deployed on isolated networks and no unauthorized persons have access to SIS devices.

    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/mailsploit-email-exploit-spoofing",
    "content": "A newly discovered exploitaffects more than 30 widely used email applications, could allow attackers to spoof sender addressesand, in some cases, carry out cross site scripting (XSS) and code injection attacks. “Mailsploit” is the collective name for several vulnerabilities affecting email clients, including Microsoft Outlook 2016, Mail for Windows 10, Apple Mail (including macOS, iOS, and watchOS versions), Mozilla Thunderbird, and Yahoo Mail for iOS and Android. Mailsploit was discovered by security researcher Sabri Haddouche, who published his findings on Tuesday December 5. Haddouche said Mailsploit had been found and confirmed in 33 different products. If successfully exploited, Mailsploit allows an attacker to falsify the address an email appears to come from. It takes advantage of a flawed implementation of RFC-1342, a 25-year-old recommendation for displaying non-ASCII text in mail headers, and allows an attacker to create headers that insert various bytes into the “from” line in an attempt to mask the true sender. This could allow an attacker to increase their chances of successfully delivering a malicious email to a target since the recipient is more likely to open it if it appears to come from a trusted source. Spoofing email headers was once a fairly trivial thing to do, but the practice was curtailed by the rollout of new safeguards such as Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC). Mailsploit could allow an attacker to create a spoofed email that will bypass DMARC. Additionally, in the case of some affected email clients, Mailsploit also permits code injection and cross XSS attacks. These include Spark, a mail client for MacOS and iOS, MacOS clients Polymail and Airmail, and mobile apps TypeApp and AquaMail. To date, Mailsploit has been patched in eight products and triaged on 12 more products. Two vendors—Mozilla and Opera—said they won’t fix the bug because they consider it to be a server-side problem. Apple Mail, Mail for Windows, and Outlook 2016 are all listed as triaged. The bug has been fixed in Yahoo Mail for iOS and Android. A full list of affected products and mitigation status isavailable here. Symantec Email Security.cloud and Symantec Messaging Gateway (SMG) message filtering are not affected by any of the vulnerabilities reported atwww.mailsploit.com.  For general message handling and sender authentication, we do not attempt to decode the local part of the “From” header’s email address. Symantec products are also not susceptible to the XSS/Code Injection portion of the vulnerabilities. Symantec has the following protection in place to protect customers against these attacks: Symantec's Security Response organization develops and deploys new security content to Symantec customers.

    "title": "surge adwind distribution emails",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/surge-adwind-distribution-emails",
    "content": "In August 2017, we began to see a surge of emails that were tied to the Adwind remote access Trojan (RAT). This increased activity led to a peak in October 2017, when we observed a large spike in the number of emails—totaling over 1.5 million—all attempting to deliver several variants of Adwind. In November, Symantec blocked over 1.3 million malicious emails related to this threat, this represents a small dip from October but the activity trend is still definitely upwards. Adwind (Backdoor.Adwind) is a cross-platform, multifunctional RAT also known as AlienSpy, Frutas, Unrecom, Sockrat, JSocket, and jRAT. It was first discovered in 2013 and can be used for logging keystrokes, using the webcam, stealing information, downloading potentially malicious files, as well as a host of other nasty activities. This high-volume campaign kicked off just in time for the holiday/shopping season, and the timing could be designed to give attackers more time to use any stolen credentials, as victims may let their guard down because they are more relaxed and engaged with other festive activities during this time. The emails spreading Adwind come with JAR or ZIP file attachments. There was a surge in the number of malicious JAR files detected by Symantec, which peaked in October but actually began in August. The increase in malicious JAR detections corresponds with the recent Adwind campaign. The number of malicious JARs jumped from just over 840,000 in July to almost 1,272,000 in August. October saw 1.55 million, and November saw over 1.3 million detected. The email surge that began in August is now well established, with the average volume now well above one million emails a month. The Adwind-spreading emails in this recent campaign are made to look like they originate from various service providers from industry sectors such as finance, telecoms, software, and logistics. The emails come with subject lines containing keywords such as “Account statement”, “payment”, and “PURCHASE ORDER”. In some instances the email used (Figure.2) is made to look like it came from a well-known logistics firm. The email looks very convincing and could fool the recipient into thinking it is legitimate, however the email attachment tells a different story. The file is a fake shipping invoice made to look like a PDF file but is actually a JAR file containing the Adwind malware. Other convincing emails appear to come from financial institutions, and some contain two attachments in case someone suspects that the JAR file may be malicious. The Adwind RAT has been around for quite some time but, in an effort to remain undetected, new variants contain very few identifiable strings and use a convoluted scheme involving layer upon layer of obfuscated function calls and classes wrapped inside numerous JAR files. The wrapper file used in this campaign has multiple packages and classes with nested function calls within these multiple classes. The packages contain AES encrypted binary files with different extensions, such as .dll, .bin, and .so, to disguise themselves. All three variants shown in Figure.3 are different in terms of obfuscation but the functionality remains the same. Once executed, the JAR files drop a payload JAR file with a random name and extension. The payload JAR is dropped in a randomly named directory and executed. The threat then runs VBS scripts in order to fingerprint the compromised computer. It also uses the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) interface to get details of any installed firewall or security products. The threat then sets registry entries to disable System Restore and set Image File Execution Options for many security products and reversing tools to svchost.exe so that the tools cannot start. It also starts ending processes related to monitoring tools. The threat also connects to its command and control (C&C) server (we observed Adwind connecting with 174[.]127[.]99[.]211 but similar IP address ranges have also been used). The payload JAR is similar to previous versions of Adwind and can be decompiled and reverse engineered using Bytecode Viewer or Java Decompiler and freely available Adwind decryptors. The important files here are those that provide further information on the threat’s configuration: The configuration file points to yet more files specified by the SERVER_PATH, PASSWORD_CRYPTED, and PRIVATE_PASSWORD keys. These keys represents the following attributes: We can use these additional files to isolate the core Adwind RAT tool and decompile it to check the core functionalities. Figure.6 is what we eventually find in the core of Adwind. Looking even deeper into the JAR file, we can see operating system specific implementations (Adwind can work on macOS, Windows, and Linux), and utility classes containing code to execute other files, open shells, and carry out other activities. The resources directory of decrypted.jar contains a set of files that are used to decrypt the contents of config.json. This file contains configuration details (Figure.7) with information on network, path, user, and VMware, among other things. After all the layers of obfuscation are peeled back, what we are left with is Adwind. And Adwind is really a cross-platform malware that can monitor user activity, take screenshots, log keystrokes, record video and audio, and much more. This latest spam campaign spreading yet another variant of the RAT shows that the criminals behind it are constantly changing their tactics to evade detection. However, we are keeping a close eye on Adwind and are adjusting our protection when necessary to keep our customers safe. In the meantime, follow these simple steps to help keep you safe from cyber attacks: Symantec has the following protection in place to protect against the malware mentioned in this blog: Symantec.Cloud has advanced heuristics to detect the type of email used to spread Adwind.

    "content": "Some of the key takeaways fromNovember’s Latest Intelligence, and the threat landscape in general, include increases in spam and phishing rates surrounding key shopping dates, new Android malware, and new research published regarding an attack group. The spam rate increased in November, up 0.6 percentage points from October, following back-to-back months where the rate declined. At 55.5 percent, this is the highest spam rate seen since March 2015. The month of November tends to come with elevated spam rates, having had the highest rate for 2016 and second-highest in 2015. Given how major shopping events in November, such as Black Friday, Cyber Monday, andSingles Day, tend to lead to an increase in email spam, these increases likely come as little surprise. In fact, over the Black Friday to Cyber Monday weekend,the Necurs botnet appears to have sent out a massive volume of spam. The particular campaign appears to be an attempt to compromise the email recipients’ computers with ransomware. The phishing rate also increased in November, where 1 in every 2,560 emails was a phishing attempt. This is the first monthly increase in the rate seen since it reached a 12-month high back in July of this year. One particular scam seen in the lead up to Black Fridayinvolved SMS and messaging apps, where the messages appear to come from legitimate companies. However, rather than legitimate offers, these messages attempt to steal personal information from the unsuspecting recipient. There were three new Android malware threats seen in November. Tying again into the holiday shopping period, two of these threats—Android.DoublehiddenandAndroid.Fakeyouwon—display advertisements and present fake offers, respectively. The third threat,Android.Rootnik.B, installs a rootkit on the compromised device. The email malware rate declined slightly in November, dropping from 1 in 355 emails to 1 in 505. This is the lowest rate seen since April, 2017 and declines were seen across all industry sectors and organization sizes. In November, Symantec identifiedan attack group targeting specific organizations in South America and Southeast Asia. Dubbed Sowbug, the group has been observed stealing documents from the organizations that it manages to break into, most of which appear to be foreign policy and diplomatic targets. This is just a snapshot of the news for the month. Check out theLatest Intelligencefor the big picture of the threat landscape with more charts, tables, and analysis.

    "content": "We have uncovered a new Android Trojan that uses several techniques to hide itself on devices, and remain in the Google Play Store. The malicious app collects device information and displays advertisements. However the functionality and behavior of this app could be easily extended to a wide range of other malicious purposes. The malware (Android.Doublehidden) is localized in the Persian language. Its name translates to ‘Photograph by Fiery’and it has a package name of com.aseee.apptec.treeapp. The pattern of availability of this malicious app on Google Play suggests the author is attempting to remain under the radar. During October and November 2017, the app has been updated five times, alternating between a working legitimate photo editing app, and this self-hiding malicious non-app. As far as we can tell, the app developer ‘i.r.r developer’ publishes several other apps which are legitimate. The app presents itself as a photo editing app, but immediately dupes the user and hides itself on installation. On launch, the app asks the user for Device Administrator permissions—awell-used approachfor malware to gain a strong foothold on the device. In the subsequent user interface (UI) screen, the app displays a message which roughly translates as: “Unfortunately, this app does not work on your phone. After exiting, the application will be deleted.” Although the app closes, the malicious functionality is already in place. The app hides itself on the device using the following techniques: The app calls setComponentEnableSetting(). Once the app launches, it disappears from the app launcher (its icon no longer appears on the home screen). The app leverages its position on the victim’s device to collect data and advertising revenue. The app collects user information to send to the malware authors. Google Cloud Messaging is used to push configuration information, including when to collect data and where to send it. The malware may collect the following information: If the user gave the malicious application the Device Administrator permission, it will be more difficult to remove. The malware also requests and displays advertisements on the device including suggestions for additional applications by using the OneSignal notification network. If the user gave the malicious application the Device Administrator permission, it will be more difficult to remove, as the user will have to disable ‘Device Administrator’ for the app in the app settings (and remember, this entry is a blank row) to actually uninstall it.

This toolkit has a broad range of capabilities, including: The apps find their way onto devices via app-centric websites, forums, and torrent sites. These can also spread over popular social messaging networks. This malware hides its primary malicious payload in a fake .tiff image in the resources of the application. The payload downloads other malicious components from a set of helper web servers. The malware sets immutable flags (atechnique laid out in a previous blog) to protect the files from being deleted by a savvy user or an antivirus application. The threat also attempts to replacedebuggerd, a key service that enables it to survive cleaning attempts by antivirus applications, or even more aggressive cleaning measures such as a factory reset. The malware decrypts and dynamically loads the hidden payload (detected asAndroid.Reputation.1). It decrypts the following command and control (C&C) URLs and queries them to get root-relevant configurations: The following is a sample response that tells the malware where to download the rootkits, when to start a root attempt, how many retry attempts to make if the attempt fails, and the metadata for the rootkit itself: After gaining root privileges, the malware selects a good candidate process (such as a system process or an app-store process) into which it can inject malicious code. The injected code launches a UNIX domain server socket, and listens for commands to trigger methods. Any malicious client entity (an app on the device) can now command the infected process to carry out malicious activities on its behalf, including sending premium-rate messages. The malware also silently downloads and installs a known malicious app namedister59.apk(detected asAndroid.Reputation.3) from the following URL: It can download and dynamically load other payloads from the following URLs without the user’s consent: Moreover, it subscribes to premium services and sends premium text messages. It requests ads and pushes other malicious apps. All devices with Android API level 8 (2.2) or greater are affected. Even if some devices with higher platform versions cannot be rooted, the malware still sends premium-rate messages. In this case, the malware falls back to premium-rate scamming, as it cannot inject or install malware. Furthermore, the malware code is highly modularized, which means it can be easily repackaged into any other popular apps. In addition, the malware is protected by a private packer, asoutlined in a previous post. The malicious code is obfuscated and the key strings are encrypted, thwarting base-level forms of static analysis and detection. Symantec recommends mobile users observe the following security best practices: Symantec and Norton products detect the malware as well as related threats discussed in this blog as the following: Martin is a member of Symantec’s Security Technology and Response team who are focused on providing round-the-clock protection against current and future cyber threats.

    "title": "tech support scams aes",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/tech-support-scams-aes",
    "content": "In my lastpost, I discussed the evolution of tech support scams and their growing penchant towards the use of code obfuscation to hide their malicious activity behind heaps of obfuscated JavaScript code. This growing trend was an endeavor, undertaken with a single and simple objective in mind: to avoid detection by string-based detection engines employed by various security vendors. This allowed the attackers behind these fake scams to remain under the radar and still be as effective as ever. Since then, a year has passed and a lot of water has flowed under the bridge. The threat landscape has witnessed a lot of significant changes, some of which include the introduction ofJavaScript-based coin miners, malware (in particular ransomware)exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s implementation of the Server Message Block(SMB) protocol to spread, and the continuing decline in exploit kit activity. But where do tech support scams stand in today’s threat landscape? As it turns out, tech support scams have got meaner, adding new anti-detection techniques to their arsenal. Over the past year, there has been a growing trend towards so-called “living off the land” tactics, which involves attackers using tools and technologies already installed on target computers. The main benefits behind using this approach are twofold: the attacker can target a larger pool of victims (as most of the users have these tools installed by default or use these technologies frequently), and at the same time keep a low profile (as these tools are not inherently malicious, using them is unlikely to trigger any alarms). In this blog post, I will describe how tech support scams have embraced this approach by making use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) specification algorithm to obfuscate their scam content. Advanced Encryption Standard orAESis an encryption algorithm used to encrypt sensitive electronic data so as to protect it from unintended third-party use while the data is stored or is in transit. AES is fast in both software and hardware and is the first (and only) publicly accessible algorithm approved by the National Security Agency (NSA). Now tech support scams are following the trend and are using the AES encryption algorithm as an anti-detection mechanism. While I’m not going to deep dive into the intricacies of this algorithm, the fact that it allows for strong data encryption, and is in widespread use around the world to secure sensitive data, makes it an ideal candidate for living off the land attacks. We have already witnessed this algorithm being used in various ransomware threats, such as TorrentLocker (Ransom.TorrentLocker) and TeslaCrypt (Trojan.Cryptolocker.N), and in other attacks such as in phishing kits. Now tech support scams are following the trend and are using the AES encryption algorithm as an anti-detection mechanism. The scam is initiated when an unsuspecting user visits a malicious website or is redirected to one by various means such as a malvertisement or compromised website. The scam web page informs the victim that the license key file has been deleted from the computer due to a malware infection and tries to lure the user into calling a “Toll free” number for assistance. An audio file, stating that the computer is infected, is also played in the background when the user arrives on the scam web page. A first look through the source code for the scam web page reveals the piece of code responsible for playing the audio. After that we come across some interesting pieces of JavaScript code. The first piece of code loads a file named aes.js, which is actually a library code implementation of the AES algorithm. As is the usual practice with software code development, this library is then used to decrypt AES obfuscated content on the fly, as we will see later. The second piece of code contains two JavaScript functions. The first function takes AES encrypted hexadecimal content as input and uses a predefined hardcoded encryption key. The function proceeds as follows: The code in Figure.2 is a sample from the AES library which is used for this decryption process. The second JavaScript function works in a similar fashion except for a minor difference in the input format. The function takes a HTML DOM element as input, from which it then extracts the encrypted HTML content. The function then proceeds to decrypt this content, similar to the earlier function, and then replaces the encrypted HTML content in the DOM element with the decrypted content which is then presented to the user. Moving forward, the scammers use the first function repeatedly by feeding it with pre-calculated encrypted hexadecimal content, to decode it on the fly into the scam messages, which are then presented to victims. A sample block of code can be seen in Figure.3. The code seen in Figure.3 decodes into the sample seen in Figure.4. This is essentially what is visible to victims when they land on the scam web page. The scam page also has JavaScript code to look out for certain keyboard key presses. Any attempt to press ESC, F11, or the Ctrl+Alt+Delete combination is thwarted by the web page going full screen, making the scenario more alarming for the user. While this tech support scam does, to a certain extent, manage to avoid detection, it fails in other aspects. For example, by using hardcoded values such as, for example, the operating system that the victim is supposedly using (hardcoded value is Windows 7), there is a risk that users will figure out it’s a scam. Considering these types of scams are usually tailored to each victim, it’s a likely assumption that this is still a work in progress and the scammers could well add more features in the future. Even though the threat landscape has evolved a great deal in the year sincemy last tech support scam blog, these scams have continued to persist and keep generating revenue for the criminals behind them. Tech support scams have also started integrating JavaScript-based cryptocurrency miners into their web pages, which serves a dual purpose in the sense that cryptocurrency can be mined using the victim’s CPU power and, as the computer’s performance becomes sluggish due to mining, it also makes the victim believe that their computer really is infected. These new techniques employed by criminals demonstrate that this type of scam is continuing to evolve and that there is still plenty of money to be made, as such I think it is safe to assume that tech support scams are here to stay. At Symantec, we provide a variety of products to protect our customers. Our Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) security component proactively protects customers from tech support scams by blocking the malicious network activity associated with such scams using a wide variety of detections. The scam is thus blocked even before it reaches the end user. Our IPS telemetry for this year shows that the countries targeted the most by tech support scams were the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, and Japan. Norton Security, Symantec Endpoint Protection, and many other Symantec security products have comprehensive network-based protection features such as firewall and IPS built in. To protect yourself from these types of scams, ensure that none of these features are turned off. Also make sure you visit legitimate websites when you need support for any product. If you notice any piracy related to our products, please feel free to contact ushere. Last but not the least, make sure your antivirus product is updated regularly. More information on tech support scams is availablehere. Siddhesh works for the Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) team in Symantec's Security Technology and Response (STAR) division.

    "title": "sowbug cyber espionage south america asia",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/sowbug-cyber-espionage-south-america-asia",
    "content": "Symantec has identified a previously unknown group called Sowbug that has been conducting highly targeted cyber attacks against organizations in South America and Southeast Asia and appears to be heavily focused on foreign policy institutions and diplomatic targets. Sowbug has been seen mounting classic espionage attacks by stealing documents from the organizations it infiltrates. Symantec saw the first evidence of Sowbug-related activity with the discovery in March 2017 of an entirely new piece of malware called Felismus used against a target in Southeast Asia.  We have subsequently identified further victims on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. While the Felismus tool was first identified in March of this year, its association with Sowbug was unknown until now. Symantec has also been able to connect earlier attack campaigns with Sowbug, demonstrating that it has been active since at least early-2015 and may have been operating even earlier. To date, Sowbug appears to be focused mainly on government entities in South America and Southeast Asia and has infiltrated organizations in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Brunei and Malaysia. The group is well resourced, capable of infiltrating multiple targets simultaneously and will often operate outside the working hours of targeted organizations in order to maintain a low profile. Some clues about the motivation and interests of the attackers can be found in their activities after compromising victims. For example, in a 2015 attack on one South American foreign ministry, the group appeared to be searching for very specific information. The first evidence of its intrusion dated from May 6, 2015 but activity appeared to have begun in earnest on May 12. The attackers appeared to be interested in one division of the ministry that is responsible for relations with the Asia-Pacific region. They attempted to extract all Word documents stored on a file server belonging to this division by bundling them into a RAR archive by running the following command: Interestingly, the command specified that only files modified from May 11, 2015 onwards should be archived. The attackers appear to have successfully extracted the archive because an hour later they returned, this time attempting to extract all documents modified from May 7, 2015, an extra four days’ worth of data. Presumably they either didn't find what they were looking for in the initial incursion, or else noticed something in the documents they stole earlier that prompted them to hunt for more information. The attackers didn’t stop there. Their next move was to list any remote shared drives and then attempt to access remote shares owned by the specific government office they were targeting, again attempting to extract all Word documents. In this case, they searched for any documents modified from May 9 onwards. The attackers then seemed to broaden their interest, listing the contents of various directories on remote shares, including one belonging to another division of the South American foreign ministry, this one responsible for relations with international organizations. They also deployed two unknown payloads to the infected server. In total, the attackers maintained a presence on the target’s network for four months between May and September 2015. Sowbug frequently maintains a long-term presence on the networks of targeted organizations, sometimes remaining inside a victim environment for up to six months. One of the tactics it uses to avoid drawing attention to itself is impersonating commonly used software packages such as Windows or Adobe Reader. It has never attempted to compromise the software itself. Rather, it gives its tools file names similar to those used by the software and places them in directory trees that could be mistaken for those used by the legitimate software. This allows the attackers to hide in plain sight, as their appearance in process listings is unlikely to arouse suspicion. For example, in September 2016, Sowbug infiltrated an organization in Asia, deploying the Felismus backdoor on one of its computers, Computer A, using the file name adobecms.exe in CSIDL_WINDOWS\\debug. From there, it installed additional components and tools to a directory named CSIDL_APPDATA\\microsoft\\security. The attackers then began to perform reconnaissance activities on Computer A via cmd.exe, collecting system-related information, such as the OS version, hardware configuration, and network information. They then performed some further reconnaissance, attempting to identify all installed applications on the computer. They returned four days later, creating a sub-directory called “common” in the Adobe directory of the Program Files folder, i.e. c:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\common, and installed another tool in this sub-directory,  again named adobecms.exe.  This was possibly an updated version of the backdoor. The attackers’ network reconnaissance appeared to be successful because a second computer of interest in the organization was identified and compromised. The attackers then returned to Computer A, installing another executable called fb.exe. This file appears to be used to copy Felismus across the network to other computers and there is evidence that the attackers used it to attempt to infect at least two more computers. The attackers took further measures to remain under the radar by carrying out their operations outside of standard office hours. In this case, the attackers maintained a presence on the target’s network for nearly six months between September 2016 and March 2017. How Sowbug performs its initial infiltration of a target’s network remains unknown. In some cases, there was no trace of how Felismus made its way onto compromised computers, meaning it was likely deployed from other compromised computers on the network. In other attacks, there was evidence that Felismus was installed using a tool known as Starloader (detected by Symantec as Trojan.Starloader). This is a loader that installs and decrypts data from a file called Stars.jpg. Additionally, Starloader was also observed deploying additional tools used by the attackers, such as credential dumpers and keyloggers. It is still unknown how Starloader is installed on the compromised computer. One possibility is that the attackers use fake software updates to install files. Symantec has found evidence of Starloader files being named AdobeUpdate.exe, AcrobatUpdate.exe, and INTELUPDATE.EXE among others. These were used to create versions of the Felismus backdoor as well as other tools. While cyber espionage attacks are often seen against targets in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, it is much less common to see South American countries targeted. However, the number of active cyber espionage operations has increased steadily in recent years and the emergence of Sowbug is a reminder that no region is immune to this kind of threat. Symantec customers are protected against Sowbug and Symantec has also made efforts to notify identified targets of its operations.

    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/ransomeware-risks-2017",
    "content": "While ransomware has long been one of the main cyber threats to businesses, the past number of months have seen organizations more exposed than ever.Symantec’s latest research paper on ransomwarehas found that businesses were the main victims of theWannaCryandPetyaoutbreaks, with corporate networks the ideal breeding ground for this new generation of self-propagating threats. Our research found that overall ransomware infection numbers have continued to trend upwards.  During the first six months of 2017, Symantec blocked just over 319,000 ransomware infections. If this infection rate continued for the full year, 2017 would be a significant increase over 2016, when a total of 470,000 infections were blocked. Contributing to this increase was a spike in blocked infections during May and June 2017, the months when the WannaCry and Petya outbreaks occurred. This year saw the arrival of a new generation of self-propagating ransomware. WannaCry, which was the first to appear, caused global panic due to its ability to spread itself across the networks of infected organizations and then spread to other organizations across the internet. Petya mimicked some of the techniques employed by WannaCry to spread itself across networks. What enabled WannaCry to spread so quickly was that its developers had incorporated the leaked “EternalBlue” exploit into its code. An exploit of a vulnerability in the Windows implementation of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol (CVE-2017-0144), it had been patched two months earlier, but there were still enough unpatched computers online for WannaCry to spread quickly. EternalBlue allowed WannaCry to act like a worm, spreading itself to other unpatched computers on the local network and across the internet by scanning random IP addresses in an attempt to find other vulnerable computers. Six weeks later, a new variant of Petya adopted similar tactics, using EternalBlue as a propagation mechanism, but also incorporating other SMB network spreading techniques, which meant it could spread within organizations to computers that had been patched against EternalBlue. Another difference from WannaCry was that Petya was far more targeted, configured to mainly affect organizations in Ukraine, although other organizations in other countries were also affected. The impact of WannaCry and Petya makes it quite likely that more attackers will attempt to replicate the tactics used by deploying ransomware as a worm. The propagation mechanisms employed by both ransomware families enabled the threats to spread quickly across an entire computer network. Many consumer computers are not connected to a network, unlike those found in organizations. While WannaCry and Petya also did have the ability to spread across the internet to other vulnerable computers, this means of transmission again largely affected other organizations. Most home internet routers would have blocked infection attempts involving the EternalBlue exploit. WannaCry and Petya’s disproportionate impact on organizations can be seen in infection statistics. During 2015 and 2016, businesses accounted for between 29 and 30 percent of ransomware infections. That figure shot up to 42 percent in the first half of 2017, with a major spike in business infections during May and June, the months WannaCry and Petya spread. Organizations need to prepare themselves for the threat posed by self-propagating ransomware. The Petya outbreak demonstrated that even without EternalBlue, attackers can create worm-like ransomware that is capable of spreading across a network. While it does require more skill and the use of additional tools, such as credential stealers, the potential rewards are much greater. During the first six months of 2017, the average ransom demand seen in new ransomware families was US$544. This follows on from a period of rapid inflation in ransom demands. During 2016, the average ransom demand seen in new ransomware families increased dramatically, rising more than threefold from $294 to $1,077. This could suggest that after a period of trial-and-error in 2016, many attackers have settled on a ransom demand of around $500 as the “sweet spot” for ransom demands. While this may not sound like a major loss for an organization, most ransom demands are for a single infected computer. If an organization finds itself with tens or hundreds of infected computers, the price demanded by attackers will quickly add up. WannaCry and Petya proved that ransomware is not a predictable threat and organizations who are complacent may be caught out. Building a multi-layered defense ensures that any point of failure is mitigated by other defensive practices. This should include not only regularly patching vulnerabilities and ensuring critical systems are backed up, but also employing multiple, overlapping, and mutually supportive defensive systems to guard against single-point failures in any specific technology or protection method. Adopting a multi-layered approach to security minimizes the chance of infection. Symantec has a comprehensive strategy that protects against ransomware in three stages.

    "content": "A new strain of the Petya ransomware started propagating on June 27, 2017, infecting many organizations. Similar toWannaCry, Petya uses the EternalBlue exploit as one of the means to propagate itself. However, it also uses classic SMB network spreading techniques, meaning that it can spread within organizations, even if they have patched against EternalBlue. Symantec has confirmed that MEDoc, a tax and accounting software package, is used for the initial insertion of Petya into corporate networks. MEDoc is widely used in Ukraine, indicating that organizations in that country were the primary target. After gaining an initial foothold, Petya then uses a variety of methods to spread across corporate networks. Petya is a worm, meaning it has the ability to self-propagate. It does this by building a list of target computers and using two methods to spread to those computers. Petya builds a list of IP addresses to spread to, which includes primarily addresses on the local area network (LAN) but also remote IPs. The full list is built as follows: Once the list of target computers has been identified, Petya builds out a list of user names and passwords it can use to spread to those targets. The list of user names and passwords is stored in memory. It uses two methods to gather credentials: Petya uses two primary methods to spread across networks: Petya checks for the presence of the following processes which are used by Norton products and Symantec Endpoint Protection: If found, Petya will not use the EternalBlue and EternalRomance exploits to spread. Petya is initially executed via rundll32.exe using the following command: Once the DLL has been loaded, it will first attempt to remove itself from the infected system. This is done by opening the file and overwriting its contents with null bytes before finally deleting the file from disk. Overwriting the file with null bytes is used as an attempt to thwart recovery of the file using forensic techniques. Next, it attempts to create the following file to be used as a flag indicating that the computer has been infected: Once installed, Petya proceeds to modify the master boot record (MBR). This allows it to hijack the normal loading process of the infected computer during the next system reboot. The modified MBR is used to encrypt the hard disk while simulating a CHKDSK screen. It then displays a ransom note to the user. MBR modification does not succeed if the threat is executed as a normal user but the threat will still attempt to spread across the network At this point, a system reboot is scheduled using the following command: By scheduling and not forcing a reboot, it provides time to allow Petya to spread to other computers in the network before user-mode encryption occurs. Petya performs encryption in two ways: Once spreading has occurred, Petya then lists all files on any fixed drive (e.g. C:\\) and checks for any of the following file extensions (skipping the%Windir%directory of that drive): .3ds .7z .accdb .ai .asp .aspx .avhd .back .bak .c .cfg .conf .cpp .cs .ctl .dbf .disk .djvu .doc .docx .dwg .eml .fdb .gz .h. hdd .kdbx .mail .mdb .msg .nrg .ora .ost .ova .ovf .pdf .php .pmf .ppt .pptx .pst .pvi .py .pyc .rar .rtf .sln .sql .tar .vbox .vbs .vcb .vdi .vfd .vmc .vmdk .vmsd .vmx .vsdx .vsv .work .xls .xlsx .xvd .zip If any of the file extensions match that of the file list, encryption occurs. As mentioned, encryption performed by Petya is twofold; firstly specific file types are encrypted in user-mode after spreading occurs and the key is encrypted with an embedded public key, Base64 encoded, and appended to the README.TXT file. After a system reboot occurs, the infected MBR is loaded, disk encryption begins, and the ransom note is displayed to the user. The \"installation key\" referenced in the ransom note is a randomly generated string that is displayed to the user. A randomly generated Salsa20 key is then used for disk encryption. As there is no relationship between the “installation key” and Salsa20 key, the disk can never be decrypted. This demonstrates that Petya is more accurately a wiper rather than ransomware. Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) and Norton products proactively protect customers against attempts to spread Petya using EternalBlue. SONAR behavior detection technology also proactively protects against Petya infections. Symantec products using definitions version 20170627.009 also detect Petya components asRansom.Petya. Petya has been in existence since 2016. It differs from typical ransomware as it doesn’t just encrypt files, it also overwrites and encrypts the master boot record (MBR). In this latest attack, the following ransom note is displayed on infected computers, demanding that $300 in bitcoins be paid to recover files: The MEDoc accounting software is used to drop and install Petya into organizations’ networks. Once in the network it uses two methods to spread. One of the ways in which Petya propagates itself is by exploiting theMS17-010vulnerability, also known as EternalBlue. It also spreads by acquiring user names and passwords and spreading across network shares. Petya is primarily impacting organizations in Europe. It is unclear at this time, however, the initial infector is software used solely in Ukraine, indicating that organizations there were the initial targets. Symantec recommends that users do not pay the ransom, particularly as there is no evidence that files will be restored. Symantec has the following IPS protection in place to protect customers against these attacks: For further detail seehttps://email.status.symantec.com/ Symantec is continuing to analyze this threat and will post further information as soon as it becomes available.

    "content": "Symantec has uncovered further links to more closely tie the WannaCry attacks with the Lazarus group. For further details, see:WannaCry: Ransomware attacks show strong links to Lazarus group Symantec has uncovered two possible links that loosely tie the WannaCry ransomware attack and the Lazarus group: While these findings do not indicate a definitive link between Lazarus and WannaCry, we believe that there are sufficient connections to warrant further investigation. We will continue to share further details of our research as it unfolds. A virulent new strain of ransomware known as WannaCry (Ransom.Wannacry) has hit hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide since its emergence on Friday, May 12. WannaCry is far more dangerous than other common ransomware types because of its ability to spread itself across an organization’s network by exploiting critical vulnerabilities in Windows computers, which were patched by Microsoft in March 2017 (MS17-010). The exploit, known as “Eternal Blue,” was released online in April in the latest of aseries of leaks by a group known as the Shadow Brokers, who claimed that it had stolen the data from the Equation cyber espionage group. Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) and Norton have proactively blocked any attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities used by WannaCry, meaning customers were fully protected before WannaCry first appeared. SEP14 Advanced Machine Learning proactively blocked all WannaCry infections on day zero, without any updates. The Blue Coat Global Intelligence Network (GIN) provides automatic detection to all enabled products for web-based infection attempts. Symantec and Norton customers are automatically protected against WannaCry using a combination of technologies. Proactive protection was provided by: Customers should have these technologies enabled for full proactive protection. SEP customers are advised to migrate to SEP 14 to take advantage of the proactive protection provided by Advanced Machine Learning signatures. WannaCry searches for and encrypts 176 different file types and appends .WCRY to the end of the file name. It asks users to pay a US$300 ransom in bitcoins. The ransom note indicates that the payment amount will be doubled after three days. If payment is not made after seven days it claims the encrypted files will be deleted. However Symantec has not found any code within the ransomware which would cause files to be deleted. Decryption of encrypted files is not possible at present but Symantec researchers continue to investigate the possibility. Seethis articlefor further details. If you have backup copies of affected files, you may be able to restore them. Symantec does not recommend paying the ransom. In some cases, files may be recovered without backups. Files saved on the Desktop, My Documents, or on a removable drive are encrypted and their original copies are wiped. These are not recoverable. Files stored elsewhere on a computer are encrypted and their original copies are simply deleted. This means they could be recovered using an undelete tool. WannaCry first appeared on Friday, May 12. Symantec saw a dramatic upsurge in the number of attempts to exploit the Windows vulnerabilities used by WannaCry from approximately 8:00 GMT onwards. The number of exploit attempts blocked by Symantec dropped slightly on Saturday and Sunday but remained quite high. Exploit numbers increased on Monday, presumably as people returned to work after the weekend. Any unpatched Windows computer is potentially susceptible to WannaCry. Organizations are particularly at risk because of its ability to spread across networks and a number of organizations globally have been affected, the majority of which are in Europe. However individuals can also be affected. Current WannaCry activity is not believed to be part of a targeted attack. WannaCry has the ability to spread itself within corporate networks without user interaction, by exploiting known vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. Computers that do not have the latest Windows security updates applied are at risk of infection. While WannaCry can spread itself across an organization’s networks by exploiting a vulnerability, the initial means of infection—how the first computer in an organization is infected—remains unconfirmed. Symantec has seen some cases of WannaCry being hosted on malicious websites, but these appear to be copycat attacks, unrelated to the original attacks. The WannaCry attackers request that the ransom be paid using Bitcoins. WannacCy generates a unique Bitcoin wallet address for each infected computer, however due to a race condition bug this code does not execute correctly. WannaCry then defaults to three hardcoded Bitcoin addresses for payment. The attackers are unable to identify which victims have paid using the hardcoded addresses, meaning that victims are unlikely to get their files decrypted. The WannaCry attackers subsequently released a new version of the malware that corrected this flaw, however this version was not as successful as the original. On May 18, a new notice was displayed on infected computers informing victims that files will be decrypted if the ransom is paid.

    "title": "dragonfly energy sector cyber attacks",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/dragonfly-energy-sector-cyber-attacks",
    "content": "The energy sector in Europe and North America is being targeted by a new wave ofcyber attacksthat could provide attackers with the means to severely disrupt affected operations. The group behind these attacks is known as Dragonfly. The group has been in operation since at least 2011 but has re-emerged over the past two years from a quiet periodfollowing exposure by Symantecand a number of other researchers in 2014. This “Dragonfly 2.0” campaign, which appears to have begun in late 2015, shares tactics and tools used in earlier campaigns by the group. The energy sector has become an area of increased interest to cyber attackers over the past two years. Most notably,disruptions to Ukraine’s power systemin 2015 and 2016 were attributed to a cyber attack and led to power outages affecting hundreds of thousands of people. In recent months, there have also been media reports ofattempted attacks on the electricity gridsin some European countries, as well as reports ofcompanies that manage nuclear facilities in the U.S. being compromisedby hackers. The Dragonfly group appears to be interested in both learning how energy facilities operate and also gaining access to operational systems themselves, to the extent that the group now potentially has the ability to sabotage or gain control of these systems should it decide to do so. Symantec customers are protected against the activities of the Dragonfly group. Symantec has evidence indicating that the Dragonfly 2.0 campaign has been underway since at least December 2015 and has identified a distinct increase in activity in 2017. Symantec has strong indications of attacker activity in organizations in the U.S., Turkey, and Switzerland, with traces of activity in organizations outside of these countries. The U.S. and Turkey were also among the countries targeted by Dragonfly in its earlier campaign, though the focus on organizations in Turkey does appear to have increased dramatically in this more recent campaign. As it did in its prior campaign between 2011 and 2014, Dragonfly 2.0 uses a variety of infection vectors in an effort to gain access to a victim’s network, including malicious emails, watering hole attacks, and Trojanized software. The earliest activity identified by Symantec in this renewed campaign was a malicious email campaign that sent emails disguised as an invitation to a New Year’s Eve party to targets in the energy sector in December 2015. The group conducted further targeted malicious email campaigns during 2016 and into 2017. The emails contained very specific content related to the energy sector, as well as some related to general business concerns. Once opened, the attached malicious document would attempt to leak victims’ network credentials to a server outside of the targeted organization. In July, Cisco blogged aboutemail-based attacks targeting the energy sector using a toolkit called Phishery.Some of the emails sent in 2017 that were observed by Symantec were also using the Phishery toolkit (Trojan.Phisherly), to steal victims’ credentials via a template injection attack. This toolkit became generally available on GitHub in late 2016, As well as sending malicious emails, the attackers also used watering hole attacks to harvest network credentials, by compromising websites that were likely to be visited by those involved in the energy sector. The stolen credentials were then used in follow-up attacks against the target organizations. In one instance, after a victim visited one of the compromised servers,Backdoor.Goodorwas installed on their machine via PowerShell 11 days later. Backdoor.Goodor provides the attackers with remote access to the victim’s machine. In2014, Symantec observed the Dragonfly group compromise legitimate software in order to deliver malware to victims, a practice also employed in the earlier 2011 campaigns. In the 2016 and 2017 campaigns the group is using the evasion framework Shellter in order to develop Trojanized applications. In particular,Backdoor.Dorshelwas delivered as a trojanized version of standard Windows applications. Symantec also has evidence to suggest that files masquerading as Flash updates may be used to install malicious backdoors onto target networks—perhaps by using social engineering to convince a victim they needed to download an update for their Flash player. Shortly after visiting specific URLs, a file named “install_flash_player.exe” was seen on victim computers, followed shortly by theTrojan.Karagany.Bbackdoor. Typically, the attackers will install one or two backdoors onto victim computers to give them remote access and allow them to install additional tools if necessary. Goodor, Karagany.B, and Dorshel are examples of backdoors used, along withTrojan.Heriplor. There are a number of indicators linking recent activity with earlier Dragonfly campaigns. In particular, the Heriplor and Karagany Trojans used in Dragonfly 2.0 were both also used in the earlier Dragonfly campaigns between 2011 and 2014. Trojan.Heriplor is a backdoor that appears to be exclusively used by Dragonfly, and is one of the strongest indications that the group that targeted the western energy sector between 2011 and 2014 is the same group that is behind the more recent attacks. This custom malware is not available on the black market, and has not been observed being used by any other known attack groups. It has only ever been seen being used in attacks against targets in the energy sector. Trojan.Karagany.B is an evolution ofTrojan.Karagany, which was previously used by Dragonfly, and there are similarities in the commands, encryption, and code routines used by the two Trojans. Trojan.Karagny.B doesn’t appear to be widely available, and has been consistently observed being used in attacks against the energy sector. However, the earlier Trojan.Karagany was leaked on underground markets, so its use by Dragonfly is not necessarily exclusive. Sabotage attacks are typically preceded by an intelligence-gathering phase where attackers collect information about target networks and systems and acquire credentials that will be used in later campaigns. The most notable examples of this are Stuxnet and Shamoon, where previously stolen credentials were subsequently used to administer their destructive payloads. The original Dragonfly campaigns now appear to have been a more exploratory phase where the attackers were simply trying to gain access to the networks of targeted organizations. The Dragonfly 2.0 campaigns show how the attackers may be entering into a new phase, with recent campaigns potentially providing them with access to operational systems, access that could be used for more disruptive purposes in future. The most concerning evidence of this is in their use of screen captures. In one particular instance the attackers used a clear format for naming the screen capture files, [machine description and location].[organization name]. The string “cntrl” (control) is used in many of the machine descriptions, possibly indicating that these machines have access to operational systems. While Symantec cannot definitively determine Dragonfly’s origins, this is clearly an accomplished attack group. It is capable of compromising targeted organizations through a variety of methods; can steal credentials to traverse targeted networks; and has a range of malware tools available to it, some of which appear to have been custom developed. Dragonfly is a highly focused group, carrying out targeted attacks on energy sector targets since at least 2011, with a renewed ramping up of activity observed in the last year. Some of the group’s activity appears to be aimed at making it more difficult to determine who precisely is behind it: Conflicting evidence and what appear to be attempts at misattribution make it difficult to definitively state where this attack group is based or who is behind it. What is clear is that Dragonfly is a highly experienced threat actor, capable of compromising numerous organizations, stealing information, and gaining access to key systems. What it plans to do with all this intelligence has yet to become clear, but its capabilities do extend to materially disrupting targeted organizations should it choose to do so. Symantec customers are protected against Dragonfly activity, Symantec has also made efforts to notify identified targets of recent Dragonfly activity. Symantec has the following specific detections in place for the threats called out in this blog: Symantec has also developed a list of Indicators of Compromise to assist in identifying Dragonfly activity: Customers of the DeepSight Intelligence Managed Adversary and Threat Intelligence (MATI) service have previously received reporting on the Dragonfly 2.0 group, which included methods of detecting and thwarting the activities of this adversary. Dragonfly relies heavily on stolen credentials to compromise a network. Important passwords, such as those with high privileges, should be at least 8-10 characters long (and preferably longer) and include a mixture of letters and numbers. Encourage users to avoid reusing the same passwords on multiple websites and sharing passwords with others should be forbidden. Delete unused credentials and profiles and limit the number of administrative-level profiles created. Employ two-factor authentication (such asSymantec VIP) to provide an additional layer of security, preventing any stolen credentials from being used by attackers. Emphasize multiple, overlapping, and mutually supportive defensive systems to guard against single point failures in any specific technology or protection method. This should include the deployment of regularly updated firewalls as well as gateway antivirus, intrusion detection or protection systems (IPS), website vulnerability with malware protection, and web security gateway solutions throughout the network. Implement and enforce a security policy whereby any sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Ensure that customer data is encrypted as well. This can help mitigate the damage of potential data leaks from within an organization. Implement SMB egress traffic filtering on perimeter devices to prevent SMB traffic leaving your network onto the internet. Educate employees on the dangers posed by spear-phishing emails, including exercising caution around emails from unfamiliar sources and opening attachments that haven’t been solicited. A full protection stack helps to defend against emailed threats, includingSymantec Email Security.cloud, which can block email-borne threats, andSymantec Endpoint Protection, which can block malware on the endpoint.Symantec Messaging Gateway’sDisarm technology can also protect computers from threats by removing malicious content from attached documents before they even reach the user. Understanding the tools, techniques, and procedures (TTP) of adversaries through services likeDeepSight Adversary Intelligencefuels effective defense from advanced adversaries like Dragonfly 2.0. Beyond technical understanding of the group, strategic intelligence that informs the motivation, capability, and likely next moves of the adversaries ensures more timely and effective decisions in proactively safeguarding your environment from these threats.

    "title": "bachosens cyber crime investigation",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/bachosens-cyber-crime-investigation",
    "content": "In attacks reminiscent of the early days of malware, a lone wolf threat actor who appears to be based in a disputed part of eastern Moldova is using advanced malware to carry out cyber attacks against large organizations for relatively modest rewards. The malware in question, Trojan.Bachosens, was so advanced that Symantec analysts initially thought they were looking at the work of nation-state actors. However, further investigation revealed a 2017 equivalent of the hobbyist hackers of the 1990s—the only difference being this hacker wasn’t out for bragging rights. He was out for financial reward. This lone wolf attacker—who we call Igor—is not an average cyber criminal with the aim of infecting as many victims as possible. Rather, he has been carrying out highly targeted attacks on specific organizations. Igor developed a specialized tool, a piece of malware called Bachosens, to gain access to at least two large organizations, an international airline and a Chinese auto-tech company. Symantec believes that Igor planted the malware through the use of spear-phishing emails, a tactic typically employed by nation-state actors. Igor targeted the auto-tech company in order to steal car diagnostics software. This software retails for approximately $1,100 through legitimate channels. Igor is selling it for just a few hundred dollars on underground forums and websites he has created expressly for this purpose. Considering the audacity of this attack, the financial rewards for Igor are pretty low. There are indications that Igor has been active for quite some time. Symantec first identified the use of Bachosens in 2014. However, the auto-tech company targeted by Igor issued an alert as far back as 2009 about its software being sold by an unauthorized reseller. Symantec was able to confirm links between the domains mentioned in this alert and Igor, indicating he has been active for almost 10 years. Symantec researchers’ analysis of Igor’s activities allowed us to gain an insight into his methods and areas of focus. Based on publicly available information, Symantec was able to find likely connections between Igor and an auto parts store located in Transnistria, a disputed territory in Moldova. His involvement in the automotive industry could explain why he showed an interest in targeting the auto-tech company. While the targeting of the Chinese auto-tech company with this malware seems to have an obvious aim—to steal software with the aim of selling it and making money—Symantec also saw some activity that is harder to explain. The Bachosens Trojan was also found on a number of systems in a large commercial airline, however, the motive for this attack is unclear at this time. Symantec is confident that this malware is only being used by Igor. Our evidence also shows that Igor’s campaigns are highly targeted, therefore it’s unlikely that this infection was accidental. There is also evidence Igor attempted to infect an online gambling organization. He used targeted spear-phishing emails with an attachment containing malicious macros in this infection attempt, which was ultimately unsuccessful. This is an attacker who is made up of contradictions: he uses well-developed malware, but makes some basic operational mistakes that allowed Symantec researchers to uncover a lot about his activities. As previously mentioned, this malware is highly sophisticated, displaying a technical competency similar to that seen in malware used by nation-state actors, indicating that its developer has a high level of skill. It is possible Igor purchased this malware from another developer, however, as no one else has been observed online using it, Symantec researchers believe this is unlikely, and believe that Igor developed this malware himself. Elements of this attack that make it stand out from the ordinary include the use of rarely used covert communication channels, such as DNS, ICMP, and HTTP, to communicate with the command and control (C&C) server. The attacker also encrypts the victim’s information before it is transmitted to the C&C server, with the malware programmed to create a set of ephemeral AES keys to encrypt the data before sending it. He also sends these communications over IPv6, which can make them harder to detect than if sent over IPv4. Igor also uses dynamic DNS (DDNS) and domain generation algorithms (DGA). DGA is used to generate a prefix, which is added to a DDNS controlled root domain to form the C&C server. Oddly, while malware that uses DGA normally creates hundreds of domains at a time—with the aim being to make it more difficult for the malware to be detected—this attacker only created 13 domains using DGA over the course of an entire year. One domain was valid for the entire year, with one new domain created each month. Creating such a small number of domains essentially defeats the purpose of using DGA, as it would only allow the attacker to avoid the most basic cyber defenses. This unusual use of DGA is just one of the parts of Igor’s operations that demonstrates a lack of polish, and shows an interesting contradiction between the advanced level of the malware and the rather unpolished way in which it is used. Igor submitted malware samples to Virus Total to test the detection capabilities of defenders, and used development names (such as mod_exe and mod_dll) in the submission, which would draw attention to it. It is known that malicious hackers often use Virus Total, a tool that analyzes URLs and files to detect malware, to test the malware they are developing. Using development file names indicates that a piece of malware is a work in progress and is more likely to draw the attention of investigators. The malware was also found packaged with computer games, which is not generally something that would be seen in advanced attacks. In fact, Symantec researchers first realized that this malware was unlikely to be the work of a nation state or sophisticated cyber attacker when they found it packaged with an online video game. Igor also used an unobfuscated keylogger, something professional cyber attackers are very unlikely to do. He also posted personal information on publicly accessible auto forums where he was attempting to sell the stolen software, exposing himself as a likely perpetrator. These various missteps indicate that while Igor may be talented enough to create highly advanced malware, he lacks the expertise of more professional cyber attackers. Symantec researchers’ investigations have turned up quite a lot of information about this cyber attacker. Symantec believes he may be based in the town of Tiraspol in eastern Moldova. Officially, Tiraspol is the second-largest city in Moldova, but it is also the capital of the self-declared republic of Transnistria, which is not recognized as an independent state by the UN. The dominant language in Transnistria is Russian, and there were Russian strings used in the Bachosens malware, and communication with the C&C server uses what appears to be the Russian equivalents of size suffixes for KB, MB, GB, and TB. This had indicated to researchers that the individual behind this malware was likely Russian speaking. The level of information the attacker knowingly or negligently revealed about himself online gave us high confidence that he is an individual involved in the auto industry who is based in this part of Eastern Europe. His likely location in Tiraspol may also explain why he appears to have such modest aims when it comes to the gains he seems to be making from cyber crime. Although it is hard to get official data given it is a disputed territory, the average monthly salary in Transnistria has been reported as being as little as a few hundred euro. In that context, selling stolen software online for a few hundred euro could represent quite the windfall for an individual based in that part of the world. While we have gleaned a lot of information about this attack, much of this attacker’s activity remains a mystery, such as the motivations behind some of his activity, and where he may have acquired the skills to create such sophisticated malware, while clearly demonstrating lack of expertise in other areas. However, this activity does show us that while nation-state actors and organized cyber crime gangs carrying off big heists may be what grabs headlines, there are still lone wolf attackers out there making a comfortable living from cyber crime.

    "content": "Spying tools and operational protocols detailed in the recent Vault 7 leak have been used in cyberattacks against at least 40 targets in 16 different countries by a group Symantec calls Longhorn. Symantec has been protecting its customers from Longhorn’s tools for the past three years and has continued to track the group in order to learn more about its tools, tactics, and procedures. The tools used by Longhorn closely follow development timelines and technical specifications laid out in documents disclosed by WikiLeaks. The Longhorn group shares some of the same cryptographic protocols specified in the Vault 7 documents, in addition to following leaked guidelines on tactics to avoid detection. Given the close similarities between the tools and techniques, there can be little doubt that Longhorn's activities and the Vault 7 documents are the work of the same group. Longhorn has been active since at least 2011. It has used a range of back door Trojans in addition to zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise its targets. Longhorn has infiltrated governments and internationally operating organizations, in addition to targets in the financial, telecoms, energy, aerospace, information technology, education, and natural resources sectors. All of the organizations targeted would be of interest to a nation-state attacker. Longhorn has infected 40 targets in at least 16 countries across the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa. On one occasion a computer in the United States was compromised but, following infection, an uninstaller was launched within hours, which may indicate this victim was infected unintentionally. A number of documents disclosed by WikiLeaks outline specifications and requirements for malware tools. One document is a development timeline for a piece of malware called Fluxwire, containing a changelog of dates for when new features were incorporated. These dates align closely with the development of one Longhorn tool (Trojan.Corentry) tracked by Symantec. New features in Corentry consistently appeared in samples obtained by Symantec either on the same date listed in the Vault 7 document or several days later, leaving little doubt that Corentry is the malware described in the leaked document. Early versions of Corentry seen by Symantec contained a reference to the file path for the Fluxwire program database (PDB) file. The Vault 7 document lists removal of the full path for the PDB as one of the changes implemented in Version 3.5.0. Up until 2014, versions of Corentry were compiled using GCC. According to the Vault 7 document, Fluxwire switched to a MSVC compiler for version 3.3.0 on February 25, 2015. This was reflected in samples of Corentry, where a version compiled on February 25, 2015 had used MSVC as a compiler. A second Vault 7 document details Fire and Forget, a specification for user-mode injection of a payload by a tool called Archangel. The specification of the payload and the interface used to load it was closely matched in another Longhorn tool called Backdoor.Plexor. A third document outlines cryptographic protocols that malware tools should follow. These include the use of inner cryptography within SSL to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, key exchange once per connection, and use of AES with a 32-byte key. These requirements align with the cryptographic practices observed by Symantec in all of the Longhorn tools. Other Vault 7 documents outline tradecraft practices to be used, such as use of the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) as a means of command and control (C&C) communications, employing wipe-on-use as standard practice, in-memory string de-obfuscation, using a unique deployment-time key for string obfuscation, and the use of secure erase protocols involving renaming and overwriting. Symantec has observed Longhorn tools following all of these practices. While other malware families are known to use some of these practices, the fact that so many of them are followed by Longhorn makes it noteworthy. While active since at least 2011, with some evidence of activity dating back as far as 2007, Longhorn first came to Symantec’s attention in 2014 with the use of a zero-day exploit (CVE-2014-4148) embedded in a Word document to infect a target with Plexor. The malware had all the hallmarks of a sophisticated cyberespionage group. Aside from access to zero-day exploits, the group had preconfigured Plexor with elements that indicated prior knowledge of the target environment. To date, Symantec has found evidence of Longhorn activities against 40 targets spread across 16 different countries. Symantec has seen Longhorn use four different malware tools against its targets: Corentry, Plexor, Backdoor.Trojan.LH1, and Backdoor.Trojan.LH2. Before deploying malware to a target, the Longhorn group will preconfigure it with what appears to be target-specific code words and distinct C&C domains and IP addresses for communications back to the attackers. Longhorn tools have embedded capitalized code words, internally referenced as “groupid” and “siteid”, which may be used to identify campaigns and victims. Over 40 of these identifiers have been observed, and typically follow the theme of movies, characters, food, or music. One example was a nod to the band The Police, with the code words REDLIGHT and ROXANNE used. Longhorn’s malware has an extensive list of commands for remote control of the infected computer. Most of the malware can also be customized with additional plugins and modules, some of which have been observed by Symantec. Longhorn’s malware appears to be specifically built for espionage-type operations, with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities. The malware uses a high degree of operational security, communicating externally at only select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals—all attempts to stay under the radar during intrusions. For C&C servers, Longhorn typically configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target. The domains appear to be registered by the attackers; however they use privacy services to hide their real identity. The IP addresses are typically owned by legitimate companies offering virtual private server (VPS) or webhosting services. The malware communicates with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom underlying cryptographic protocol to protect communications from identification. Prior to the Vault 7 leak, Symantec’s assessment of Longhorn was that it was a well-resourced organization which was involved in intelligence gathering operations. This assessment was based on its global range of targets and access to a range of comprehensively developed malware and zero-day exploits. The group appeared to work a standard Monday to Friday working week, based on timestamps and domain name registration dates, behavior which is consistent with state-sponsored groups. Symantec’s analysis uncovered a number of indicators that Longhorn was from an English-speaking, North American country. The acronym MTWRFSU (Monday Tuesday Wednesday ThuRsday Friday Saturday SUnday) was used to configure which day of the week malware would communicate with the attackers. This acronym is common in academic calendars in North America. Some of the code words found in the malware, such as SCOOBYSNACK, would be most familiar in North America. In addition to this, the compilation times of tools with reliable timestamps indicate a time zone in the Americas. Longhorn has used advanced malware tools and zero-day vulnerabilities to infiltrate a string of targets worldwide. Taken in combination, the tools, techniques, and procedures employed by Longhorn are distinctive and unique to this group, leaving little doubt about its link to Vault 7. Throughout its investigation of Longhorn, Symantec’s priority has been the protection of its customers. Through identifying different strains of Longhorn malware, connecting them to a single actor, and learning more about the group’s tactics and procedures, Symantec has been able to better defend customer organizations against this and similar threats. In publishing this new information, Symantec’s goal remains unchanged: to reassure customers that it is aware of this threat and actively working to protect them from it. Symantec and Norton products have been protecting against Longhorn malware for a number of years with the following detections: The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "title": "bayrob suspects extradited",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/bayrob-suspects-extradited",
    "content": "Three Romanian men have been indicted in the US for allegedly operating a longstanding fraud operation known as Bayrob that conned victims out of millions of dollars. Bogdan Nicolescu (aka “Masterfraud”, aka “mf”); Danet Tiberiu (aka “Amightysa”, aka “amy”); and Radu Miclaus (aka “Minolta”, aka “min”) were arrested by police in Romania earlier this year before being extradited to the US, where they now face multiple charges relating to fraud, identity theft, money laundering, and trafficking in counterfeit goods or services. Our research shows that the Bayrob gang are career cybercriminals, earning a living from online fraud. They specialize in detailed scams and go to great lengths to craft convincing emails and create fake websites, voice messages, and even customer support chatrooms in order to dupe victims. The gang began its career running elaborate cons where it created fake vehicle auctions to defraud victims out of tens of thousands of dollars. It later expanded and diversified with a number of different fraud and malware operations, ranging from credit card theft to cryptocurrency mining using infected computers. The FBI believes that the Bayrob group has stolen at least US$4 million from victims over the past eight years, though the actual total may be up to $35 million. It also established that the group infected between 60,000 and 160,000 computers and sent out 11 million malicious emails. The arrests are the culmination of an eight-year law enforcement investigation which was assisted by Symantec. During this time, Symantec discovered multiple versions of Bayrob malware, collected helpful intelligence data, and witnessed Bayrob as it morphed from online fraud to a 300,000+ botnet for cryptocurrency mining. Symantec succeeded in exposing the gang’s operations, gaining insight into its key players, tactics, malware, and the potential impact and criminal activity undertaken. Bayrob first came to our attention in 2007, when it was discovered operating a scam that conned victims into believing they were buying a vehicle on eBay. Victims’ computers were infected with custom designed malware (Trojan.Bayrob) which displayed fake eBay web pages and misled users into thinking they were conducting a legitimate purchase on the auction site. The gang identified potential victims by listing vehicles for sale on a number of websites, including eBay and classified advertising websites. It noted anyone who displayed an interest in the sale, such as those who asked questions or put a bid on the vehicle. The gang would then pretend that the sale had concluded but later email potential victims, informing them that the sale had fallen through and asking if they were still interested. Attached to these emails was a slideshow file, containing pictures of the vehicle supposedly on sale. This file was infected with Trojan.Bayrob. If the victim opened it, the malware was installed on their computer. Once the attackers verified that the Bayrob Trojan was running on a victim’s computer, they moved on to the next stage of the scam by sending an email with what they claimed was a link to a new auction for the vehicle. It was at this point that the Trojan came into play. If the victim clicked on the link, it would redirect them to a fake eBay page. If they decided to buy the vehicle, they were asked to pay by way of a bank transfer, which was routed to an account that belonged to a money mule, who would in turn transfer the proceeds of the fraud to the gang. From the victim’s standpoint it appeared they were visiting a real eBay auction. However, if the link was followed from an uninfected computer, there would be no such auction. The gang went to great lengths to make the scam appear realistic. Its emails were composed in fluent English and every iteration of the Bayrob Trojan was customized for its intended victim. The fake eBay web pages even included fictitious feedback about the seller. The Trojan was also capable of generating fake vehicle history reports, along with fake pages from escrow and delivery services. The fraud had a major impact on its victims, who often transferred thousands of dollars thinking they were paying for a new car and ended up with nothing. Bayrob’s activities were initially exposed by Symantec in 2007, when wepublished a series of blogshighlighting the eBay scam, and several media outlets reported on their activities. The gang reacted angrily and, for a while, registered command and control (C&C) domain names that contained abusive references to our researchers and made disparaging references to Symantec in its code. However, public attention didn’t deter the gang from further expanding and refining its operations. For example, they created a fake trucking company, which was used to supposedly transport purchased vehicles to their victims. The trucking company would first inform the victim their vehicle was on the way and then later email them informing them of delays. It even operated a phone line and fake voicemail service to appear more convincing. The whole purpose of the fake trucking company was to string the victim along for as long as possible in order to make sure the gang received the money before the victim realized they’d been conned. In order to move the proceeds of its scams back to Romania, the gang recruited a wide network of money mules. It found potential mules by spamming classified advertising websites with fake job ads. Rather than the usual cybercriminal tactic of using “work from home” ads, the Bayrob gang often copied legitimate job ads in order appear more convincing. Those who responded were told that the job had been filled but were then offered an alternative, work from home job. As with its other operations, money mule recruitment was professionally executed and backed up by a series of fake websites and convincing looking emails, such as one purporting to offer the recipient a job with a technology company. Some victims were even told they’d gotten a job with a fake Yahoo subsidiary called Yahoo Transfers. Given that they would be handling the gang’s stolen money, mules were thoroughly vetted during recruitment, using Google searches, instant messaging, and VoIP calls. The group recruited mules on both sides of the Atlantic. Victims in the US were instructed to route payments to a bank account controlled by a mule in the US. These in turn were asked to transfer the money to another mule, usually in an Eastern European country. They would then presumably transfer the money on to gang members. Mules in the US were often vulnerable people in difficult circumstances. They appeared to be unwitting pawns of the gang, unaware of what they’d become involved with. Less is known about the money mules used in Europe, but most appeared to collect transferred funds using fake identities, indicating they may have been more complicit in the gang’s activities. Mules in the US were given two options for payment. They could keep six percent of the funds they transferred or they could send the entire amount and later receive a check for 10 percent of the total.  The latter option was a scam and nobody who opted for it received any payment from the gang. Despite putting these money mules at risk of arrest and prosecution, the gang had no qualms about double-crossing them and stealing from them too. Over time, the Bayrob gang expanded beyond its original auction fraud and into other areas of cybercrime. The group began stealing credit card information from the users of infected computers, using the stolen cards to finance the purchase of online infrastructure and services that allowed it to grow its operations. In recent years, the gang has concentrated on rapidly growing the number of infected computers in order to build a botnet. When it was exclusively involved in auction fraud, the number of infected computers was around 1,000 at any one time. However, by 2014 it had jumped to approximately 50,000 and by mid-2016 it had grown to over 300,000 and continued to grow. One of the main purposes of this botnet appeared to be cryptocurrency mining. A large number of infected computers provided the gang with the necessary processing power to profit significantly from mining. Since 2011, Symantec has managed to progressively uncover the gang’s network, gaining a broad picture of its operations. The information generated by our investigation not only helped us to improve our protections against the group’s malware, but also allowed us to prevent future attacks and warn potential victims. What we learned assisted the FBI in its investigation and we opted not to publish what we discovered in recent years until the FBI investigation was concluded. Bayrob employed a high degree of internal security. Their online communications involved extensive use of encryption, with email encrypted using PGP and instant messaging encrypted with the Off-The-Record (OTR) messaging protocol. In order to cover its tracks, the gang hid behind a double layer of proxies, connecting first to proxies in Romania and then to more proxies in the US. One of our most significant breakthroughs came when we discovered a weak point in their use of these proxies. Due to this weakness, the gang's malicious activities were exposed, allowing us to passively observe its activities on computers Symantec was protecting.Our investigation required time and patience. In one case, we observed the gang’s malicious activities for a year and a half before it made an error that exposed one of its suspected members. Over time we came to understand the group’s infrastructure which helped us to get see more of the gang’s operations. Symantec’s pursuit of Bayrob is one of many long-standing investigations we currently have underway, all of which are motivated by a desire to protect our customers. Today’s arrests illustrate the value of effective co-operation between security companies and law enforcement and sends a clear signal to international cybercrime gangs that they are not beyond the reach of the justice system. Symantec products use multiple layers over protection against Bayrob’s malware. Protection has been continuously updated since 2007 to block against each new iteration of the group’s malware. Symantec and Norton products block Bayrob malware with the following detections: Intrusion prevention system In addition to this, a range of Symantec generic detections also successfully block Bayrob malware. The addition of generic detections to our defense layer makes it more difficult for attackers to identify which detections are designed to specifically block their malware, making it hard to test against them. Symantec has gathered full technical details and indicators of compromise for all Bayrob malware variants discovered since 2007. This can be supplied to any member of the information security community upon request.

    "content": "Shamoon (W32.Disttrack), the aggressive disk-wiping malware which was used in attacks against the Saudi energy sector in 2012, has made a surprise comeback and was used in a fresh wave of attacks against targets in Saudi Arabia. The malware used in the recent attacks (W32.Disttrack.B) is largely unchanged from the variant used four years ago. In the 2012 attacks, infected computers had their master boot records wiped and replaced with an image of a burning US flag. The latest attacks instead used a photo of the body of Alan Kurdi, the three year-old Syrian refugee who drowned in the Mediterranean last year. The attackers appear to have done a significant amount of preparatory work for the operation. The malware was configured with passwords that appear to have been stolen from the targeted organizations and were likely used to allow the threat to spread across a targeted organization’s network. How the attackers obtained the stolen credentials is unknown. The malware had a default configuration that triggered the disk-wiping payload at 8:45pm local time on Thursday, November 17. The Saudi Arabian working week runs from Sunday to Thursday. It would appear that the attack was timed to occur after most staff had gone home for the weekend in the hope of reducing the chance of discovery before maximum damage could be caused. Shamoon uses a number of components to infect computers. The first component is a dropper, which creates a service with the name ‘NtsSrv’ to remain persistent on the infected computer. It spreads across a local network by copying itself on to other computers and will drop additional components to infected computers. The dropper comes in 32-bit and 64-bit versions. If the 32-bit dropper detects a 64-bit architecture, it will drop the 64-bit version. The second component is the wiper, which drops a third component, known as the Eldos driver. This enables access to the hard disk directly from user-mode without the need of Windows APIs. The wiper uses the Eldos driver to overwrite the hard disk with the aforementioned photos of the Syrian boy. The final component is the reporter. This is responsible for handling communications with a command and control (C&C) server operated by the attackers. It can download additional binaries from the C&C server and change the pre-configured disk-wiping time if instructed by the C&C server. It is also configured to send a report verifying that a disk has been wiped to the C&C server. Although attacks involving destructive malware such as Shamoon are relatively rare, they can be highly disruptive for the targeted organization, potentially knocking mission-critical computers offline. Why Shamoon has suddenly returned again after four years is unknown. However, with its highly destructive payload, it is clear that the attackers want their targets to sit up and take notice. Symantec and Norton products protect against Shamoon with the following detections: Intrusion prevention system The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "content": "The group behind the Gatak Trojan (Trojan.Gatak) continues to pose a threat to organizations, with the healthcare sector in particular heavily affected by attacks. Gatak is known for infecting its victims through websites promising product licensing keys for pirated software. While the group focused on US targets, it has diversified over the past two years and attacks are now taking place against organizations in a broad range of countries. The majority of Gatak infections (62 percent) occur on enterprise computers. Analysis of recent enterprise attacks indicates that the healthcare sector is by far the most affected by Gatak. Of the top 20 most affected organizations (organizations with the most infected computers), 40 percent were in the healthcare sector. In the past, the insurance sector was also heavily targeted by the group. Gatak victims are infected using websites offering product key generators or “keygens” for pirated software. The malware is bundled with the product key and, if the victim is tricked into downloading and opening one of these files, the malware is surreptitiously installed on their computer. The attackers appear to focus on offering product keys for software that is more likely to be used in professional environments. The websites used in the attacks are controlled by the attackers and have no connection with the developers of the software.  At no point are legitimate versions of software compromised. Among the software brands used as lures were: The product keys downloaded from these websites do not work and simply generate pseudo-random sequence of characters. This means all the victim gets from the download is a junk file and a potential Gatak infection. The Gatak Trojan (aka Stegoloader) has been used in attacks since at least 2011. There are two main components of the malware. A lightweight deployment module (Trojan.Gatak.B) can perform detailed system fingerprinting on infected computers and selectively install additional payloads. The main module (Trojan.Gatak) is a fully fledged back door Trojan, which maintains a persistent presence on an infected computer and steals information from it. A notable feature of Gatak is its use of steganography, a technique for hiding data within image files. When Gatak is installed on a computer, it attempts to download a PNG image file from one of a number of URLs hardcoded into the malware. The image looks like an ordinary photograph, but contains an encrypted message within its pixel data. The Gatak Trojan is capable of decrypting this message, which contains commands and files for execution. In approximately 62 percent of incidents, lateral movement across the victim’s network occurs within two hours of infection. In the remaining cases, lateral movement began at some point after the two hour mark. The variance indicates that lateral movement isn’t automated and instead carried out manually by the attackers. Whether the attackers don’t have the resources to exploit all infections immediately or whether they prioritize some infections over others is unknown. Little is known about how the attackers move across an organization’s network. The most likely explanation is that they exploit weak passwords and poor security in file shares and network drives. There is no evidence of zero-day exploits or sophisticated hacking tools being employed. In some cases, the attackers have infected computers with other malware, including various ransomware variants and the Shylock (Trojan.Shylock) financial Trojan. In the case of Shylock, these appear to be older versions of the threat and might even be “false flag” infections. They may be used by the group when they believe their attack has been uncovered, in order to throw investigators off the scent. Little is known about the group behind Gatak, although the corporate nature of its targets, along with the absence of zero-day vulnerabilities or advanced malware modules suggest that it may be cybercriminal in nature, however there are also capabilities within the malware for more traditional espionage operations. It is unclear how Gatak is profiting from its attacks. One possibility is data theft, with the attackers selling personally identifiable information and other stolen data on the cyberunderground. This could explain the attackers’ heavy focus on the healthcare sector, with healthcare records usually selling for more than other personal information. However, Gatak’s means of distribution, through keygen websites, indicates that the attackers may be more opportunistic. By using a watering-hole approach, the attackers play a largely passive role, with relatively little control over who is infected. If this is the case, the healthcare sector may simply be the most susceptible to these kinds of attacks. Healthcare organizations can often be pressurized, under-resourced, and many use legacy software systems that are expensive to upgrade. Consequently, workers could be more likely to take shortcuts and install pirated software. While organizations in other sectors appear to be infected less frequently, the attackers don’t appear to ignore or remove these infections when they occur. Since it first appeared five years ago the Gatak group has carried out a steady stream of attacks and the Trojan represents a serious threat to any organization, particularly in the healthcare sector. Gatak provides a timely reminder that the use of pirated software can compromise security in addition to creating legal issues for an organization. Along with using a robust security solution, organizations should regularly audit the software used on their network and educate staff about the dangers of using pirated or unapproved software.

    "title": "odinaff trojan financial attacks",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/odinaff-trojan-financial-attacks",
    "content": "Since January 2016, discreet campaigns involving malware called Trojan.Odinaff have targeted a number of financial organizations worldwide. These attacks appear to be extremely focused on organizations operating in the banking, securities, trading, and payroll sectors. Organizations who provide support services to these industries are also of interest. Odinaff is typically deployed in the first stage of an attack, to gain a foothold onto the network, providing a persistent presence and the ability to install additional tools onto the target network. These additional tools bear the hallmarks of a sophisticated attacker which has plagued the financial industry since at least 2013–Carbanak. This new wave of attacks has also used some infrastructure that has previously been used in Carbanak campaigns. These attacks require a large amount of hands on involvement, with methodical deployment of a range of lightweight back doors and purpose built tools onto computers of specific interest. There appears to be a heavy investment in the coordination, development, deployment, and operation of these tools during the attacks. Custom malware tools, purpose built for stealthy communications (Backdoor.Batel), network discovery, credential stealing, and monitoring of employee activity are deployed. Although difficult to perform, these kinds of attacks on banks can be highly lucrative. Estimates of total losses to Carbanak-linked attacks range from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of dollars. Attacks involving Odinaff appear to have begun in January 2016. The attacks have hit a wide range of regions, with the US the most frequently targeted. It was followed by Hong Kong, Australia, the UK and Ukraine. Most Odinaff attacks were against financial targets. In attacks where the nature of the victim’s business was known, financial was by far the most frequently hit sector, accounting for 34 percent of attacks. There were a small number of attacks against organizations in the securities, legal, healthcare, government and government services targets; however, it is unclear whether all of these were financially motivated. Around 60 percent of attacks were against targets whose business sector was unknown, but in many cases these were against computers running financial software applications, meaning the attack was likely financially motivated. The Odinaff attackers’ use a variety of methods to break into the networks of targeted organizations. One of the most common methods of attack is through lure documents containing a malicious macro. If the recipient opts to enable macros, the macro will install the Odinaff Trojan on their computer. Another attack involves the use of password-protected RAR archives, in order to lure the victims into installing Odinaff on their computers. Although Symantec has not seen how these malicious documents or links are distributed, we believe spear-phishing emails are the most likely method. Trojan.Odinaff has also been seen to be distributed through botnets, where the Trojan is pushed out to computers already infected with other malware, such as Andromeda (Downloader.Dromedan) and  Snifula (Trojan.Snifula). In the case of Andromeda, this was bundled as a Trojanized installer for AmmyyAdmin, a legitimate remote administration tool. The Trojanized installer was downloaded from the official website, which has been targeted repeatedly in recent times to spread a number of different malware families. Odinaff is a relatively lightweight back door Trojan that connects to a remote host and looks for commands every five minutes. Odinaff has two key functions: it can download RC4 encrypted files and execute them and it can also issue shell commands, which are written to a batch file and then executed. Given the specialist nature of these attacks, a large amount of manual intervention is required. The Odinaff group carefully manages its attacks, maintaining a low profile on an organization’s network, downloading and installing new tools only when needed. Trojan.Odinaff is used to perform the initial compromise, while other tools are deployed to complete the attack. A second piece of malware known as Batle (Backdoor.Batel) is used on computers of interest to the attackers. It is capable of running payloads solely in memory, meaning the malware can maintain a stealthy presence on infected computers. The attackers make extensive use of a range of lightweight hacking tools and legitimate software tools to traverse the network and identify key computers. These include: The group also appears to have developed malware designed to compromise specific computers. The build times for these tools were very close to the time of deployment. Among them were components capable of taking screenshot images at intervals of between five and 30 seconds. Symantec has found evidence that the Odinaff group has mounted attacks on SWIFT users, using malware to hide customers’ own records of SWIFT messages relating to fraudulent transactions. The tools used are designed to monitor customers’ local message logs for keywords relating to certain transactions. They will then move these logs out of customers’ local SWIFT software environment. We have no indication that SWIFT network was itself compromised. These “suppressor” components are tiny executables written in C, which monitor certain folders for files that contain specific text strings. Among the strings seen by Symantec are references to dates and specific International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs). The folder structure in these systems seem to be largely user defined and proprietary, meaning each executable appears to be clearly tailored to for a target system. One of the files found along with the suppressor was a small disk wiper which overwrites the first 512 bytes of the hard drive. This area contains the Master Boot Record (MBR) which is required for the drive to be accessible without special tools. We believe this tool is used to cover the attackers’ tracks when they abandon the system and/or to thwart investigations. These Odinaff attacks are an example of another group believed to be involved in this kind of activity, following the Bangladesh central bank heist linked to the Lazarus group. There are no apparent links between Odinaff’s attacks and the attacks on banks’ SWIFT environments attributed to Lazarus and the SWIFT-related malware used by the Odinaff group bears no resemblance to Trojan.Banswift, the malware used in the Lazarus-linked attacks. The attacks involving Odinaff share some links to the Carbanak group, whose activities became public in late 2014. Carbanak also specializes in high-value attacks against financial institutions and has been implicated in a string of attacks against banks in addition to point of sale (PoS) intrusions. Aside from the similar modus operandi, there are a number of other links between Carbanak and Odinaff: Since Carbanak’s main Trojan, Anunak (Trojan.Carberp.B and Trojan.Carberp.D) was never observed in campaigns involving Odinaff, we firmly believe the group uses a number of discreet distribution channels to compromise financial organizations. While it is possible that Odinaff is part of the wider organization, the infrastructure crossover is atypical, meaning it could also be a similar or cooperating group. The discovery of Odinaff indicates that banks are at a growing risk of attack. Over the past number of years, cybercriminals have begun to display a deep understanding of the internal financial systems used by banks. They have learned that banks employ a diverse range of systems and have invested time in finding out how they work and how employees operate them. When coupled with the high level of technical expertise available to some groups, these groups now pose a significant threat to any organization they target. Symantec and Norton products detect these threats as: Bluecoat products will: The following are examples of the various tools in use: Odinaff document droppers SWIFT log suppressors Backdoor.Batel RTF document dropper Backdoor.Batel stagers Older Batel *.CPL droppers Cobalt Strike, possible ATM implants Cobalt Strike implants Backdoor.Batel loaders Ammyy Admin remote administration tools Ammyy Admin, Trojanized RemoteUtilities remote administration tools The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.
