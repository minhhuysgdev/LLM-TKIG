    "content": "Buckeye (also known as APT3, Gothic Panda, UPS Team, and TG-0110) is a cyberespionage group that is believed to have been operating for well over half a decade. Traditionally, the group attacked organizations in the US as well as other targets. However, Buckeye’s focus appears to have changed as of June 2015, when the group began compromising political entities in Hong Kong. Since March 2016, the group has appeared to mostly focus on organizations in Hong Kong, sending malicious emails to targets as recently as August 4, and attempting to spread within compromised networks in order to steal information. Using the combined threat intelligence of Symantec and Blue Coat Systems, we have built a clear and concise picture of how Buckeye has evolved its tactics in recent years. This has allowed us to further enhance our protection capabilities against the group’s campaigns. Symantec has observed Buckeye activity dating back to 2009, involving attacks on various organizations in several regions. Buckeye used a remote access Trojan (Backdoor.Pirpi) in attacks against a US organization’s network in 2009. The group delivered Backdoor.Pirpi through malicious attachments or links in convincing spear-phishing emails. Symantec has identified additional tools used by the group, which will be discussed later. Buckeye has been known to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities in the past, such asCVE-2010-3962in an campaign in 2010 and CVE-2014-1776 in 2014. Although other zero-day attacks have been reported, they have not been confirmed by Symantec. All zero-day exploits known, or suspected, to have been used by this group are for vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash. More recently, Symantec telemetry has revealed Backdoor.Pirpi connections from compromised computers based in Hong Kong dating back to August 2015. The infections significantly increased in number towards the end of March 2016 and the beginning of April 2016. Additional investigations discovered related malware samples and determined that targeted organizations were political entities in Hong Kong. In at least some of these recent attacks, Buckeye used spear-phishing emails with a malicious .zip attachment. The .zip archive attached to the email contains a Windows shortcut (.lnk) file with the Microsoft Internet Explorer logo. Clicking on the shortcut ultimately leads to Backdoor.Pirpi being downloaded and executed on the affected computer. From 2015 to date, Symantec identified approximately 82 organizations in various regions that had Buckeye tools present on their network. However, this is not an accurate picture of the targets of interest to Buckeye. The group casts a wide net while trawling for targets but only remains active on the networks of organizations it is interested in. Symantec determined a more accurate picture of Buckeye’s targets by looking at where Buckeye remained active on the network longer than a day, deployed additional tools, and spread onto multiple computers. After these filters were applied to our data, we found a total of 17 organizations, located in Hong Kong (13), the US (3), and the UK (1). It should be noted that this data goes back to 2015 and that the proportion of targets in Hong Kong from March 2016 would be considerably higher. Up to mid-2015, Buckeye’s traditional targets were varying categories of US organizations, which match the types of victims seen in the UK. Buckeye interests changed substantially around June 2015 when the group began infecting organizations in Hong Kong. Infections in the UK and US ceased shortly after this time. Buckeye uses a number of hacking tools as well as malware. Many of the hacking tools are open source applications that have been patched or modified in some manner by Buckeye in an attempt to evade detection. Buckeye uses Backdoor.Pirpi, a remote access Trojan capable of reading, writing, and executing files and programs. Backdoor.Pirpi also collects information about the target’s local network, including the domain controller and workstations. As mentioned previously, Buckeye also uses a number of hacking tools, including the following: Keylogger: The keylogger is configured using the command line parameters: NetworkService, Replace, Install, Register and Unregister. These parameters install it as a service. The keylogger then records keystrokes in encrypted files, for example: thumbcache_96.dbx. It also gathers network information such as the MAC address, IP address, WINS, DHCP server, and gateway. RemoteCMD: This tool executes commands on remote computers, similar to the PsExec tool. Usage is: %s shareIp domain[USER INFORMATION|[USER NAME AND PASSWORD]] [/run:[COMMAND]] The commands to be passed consist of upload, download, Service (create, delete, start, stop), delete, rename, andAT PwDumpVariant: This tool imports lsremora.dll (often downloaded by the attacker as part of the toolset) and uses the GetHash export of this DLL. On execution, the tool injects itself into lsass.exe and is triggered with the argument “dig”. OSinfo: OSInfo is a general purpose, system information gathering tool. It has the following command line argument help: info  <Server/Domain> [options][options]:-d Domain-o OsInfo-t TsInfo-n NetuseInfo-s ShareInfo ShareDir-c Connect Test-a Local And Global Group User Info-l Local Group User Info-g Global Group User Info-ga Group Administrators-gp Group Power Users-gd Group Domain Admins-f <infile> //input server list from infile, OneServerOneLineinfo <\\\\server> <user> ChromePass: A tool from NirSoft used for recovering passwords stored in the Chrome browser. Lazagne: A compiled Python tool that extracts passwords from various locally installed application classes, such as web browsers. The full list is: chats, svn, wifi, mails, windows, database, sysadmin, and browsers. Buckeye seems to target file and print servers, which makes it likely the group is looking to steal documents. This, coupled with the group’s use of zero-day exploits in the past, customized tools, and the types of organizations being targeted would suggest that Buckeye is a state-sponsored cyberespionage group. Symantec, Norton, and Blue Coat products protect against the activities of this cyberespionage group. Symantec and Norton products offer the following detections: Intrusion prevention system The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "title": "equation cyberespionage group breached",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/equation-cyberespionage-group-breached",
    "content": "An attack group calling itself the Shadow Brokers has released a trove of data it claims to have stolen from the Equation cyberespionage group. The data contains a range of exploits and tools the attack group state were used by Equation. The Shadow Brokers said that the data dump was a sample of what had been stolen from hacking Equation and that the “best” files would be auctioned off to the highest bidder. Equation was uncovered last year, when it was found to be using highly advanced malware tools to target organizations in a range of countries. The group is technically competent and well resourced, using highly developed malware tools that go to great lengths to evade detection. Symantec Security Response is analyzing the data released by Shadow Brokers in order to assess the accuracy of the group's claims and will update our malware and exploit protections if necessary. Q: How much data has been released?A: Shadow Brokers released a 256-megabyte compressed archive containing around 4,000 files. Q: What kinds of files are in the archive?A: The files mainly appear to be installation scripts, configuration files, and exploits targeting a range of routers and firewall appliances. Q: How old is the data?A: Most of the files appear to be several years old, dating back to between 2010 and 2013. Q: Does the data dump actually contain working exploits?A: It will take some time to assess all of the released files. However, early indications are that at least some of the tools released are functioning exploits. Q: What do we know about Shadow Brokers?A: The group has no prior history. While it may be previously unknown, “Shadow Brokers” could also be a cover name for another group. Q: What do we know about the unreleased data held by the group?A: Very little. It has said it is keeping this a secret and simply claimed that it contains the “best” files. Q: How will it auction the unreleased data?A: The group provided a Bitcoin address and instructed interested parties to send Bitcoin to it. Losing bids would not be refunded and instead losing bidders would be granted “consolation prizes”. It claimed it was seeking to raise the incredibly large sum of 1 million Bitcoin (US$576.3 million) and, if it received this, it would publicly release more data. Q: Is it possible this is a hoax?A: While the files released are certainly not junk, it will take some time to fully establish if they are definitely linked to the Equation group. Q: Does the data dump have links to any known tools?A: Some of the files reference alleged US National Security Agency (NSA) tools named in the Edward Snowden leaks, e.g. “EPIC BANANA”, “EXTRA BACON”, and “ELIGIBLE CONTESTANT.” However, since these names were already public information it doesn’t provide proof of the files’ origin. Update – August 18, 2016: Q: There have been reports that leaked files contain a unique implementation of the RC5/RC6 encryption algorithm that has previously only been seen in Equation Group malware. Can you corroborate this?A: We don’t believe this can prove a definite link between the two. The RC5/RC6 implementations are similar, in that some values used for instantiating the algorithm in their implementation were negated. However, further analysis by Symantec found a large number of files previously seen in the wild where these values were also present. We believe that the negated values might be an optimization introduced by the compiler used. In short, the similarities could have come about by accident rather than design. Q: Have patches been released for any of the vulnerabilities disclosed in the leak?A: To date, Cisco and Fortinet have issued security updates after exploits for their products were found in the leak.Cisco saidthat the leaked files contained exploits of two vulnerabilities affecting a number of its products: the Cisco ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) and legacy Cisco PIX firewalls. The company has issued security advisories for both: Cisco said that the while CVE-2016-6366 was a newly discovered vulnerability, CVE-2016-6367 had been fixed in 2011. Meanwhile Fortinet has published asecurity advisoryabout a cookie parser buffer overflow vulnerability which it said affected older versions of its FortiGate (FOS) firmware, versions 4.3.8 and below. Customers are advised to upgrade to release 5.x or upgrade to 4.3.9 or above for models not compatible with 5.x. Q: Did the leak include any exploits for Symantec products?A: No exploits of Symantec products were found in the released files. Our investigation is still in progress. Update – August 23, 2016: Q: Are Juniper Networks products affected by the leak?A: Juniper Networks has said the leakincluded tools targeting its NetScreen devices. “As part of our analysis of these files, we identified an attack against NetScreen devices running ScreenOS,” a Juniper Networks spokesperson said. “We are examining the extent of the attack, but initial analysis indicates it targets the boot loader and does not exploit a vulnerability on ScreenOS devices.” The company said it would continue its analysis and publish any new information in a blog or security advisory once more is known. Q: Has any money been sent to the Shadow Brokers yet?A: Records associated with the Bitcoin address provided by the Shadow Brokers show that the group  has received 63 payments totaling 1.76 Bitcoin (approximately US$1,023). The majority came from a single payment of 1.5 Bitcoin. Q: Do Symantec products detect the tools released in the leak?A: Symantec and Norton products protect against the malware and exploits found in the leak with the following detections: The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "title": "strider cyberespionage sauron",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/strider-cyberespionage-sauron",
    "content": "A previously unknown group called Strider has been conducting cyberespionage-style attacks against selected targets in Russia, China, Sweden, and Belgium. The group uses an advanced piece of malware known as Remsec (Backdoor.Remsec) to conduct its attacks. Remsec is a stealthy tool that appears to be primarily designed for spying purposes. Its code contains a reference to Sauron, the all-seeing antagonist in Lord of the Rings. Strider’s attacks have tentative links with a previously uncovered group,Flamer. The use of Lua modules, which we’ll discuss later, is a technique that has previously been used by Flamer. One of Strider’s targets had also previously been infected byRegin. Strider has been active since at least October 2011. The group has maintained a low profile until now and its targets have been mainly organizations and individuals that would be of interest to a nation state’s intelligence services. Symantec obtained a sample of the group’s Remsec malware from a customer who submitted it following its detection by our behavioral engine. Remsec is primarily designed to spy on targets. It opens a back door on an infected computer, can log keystrokes, and steal files. Strider has been highly selective in its choice of targets and, to date, Symantec has found evidence of infections in 36 computers across seven separate organizations. The group’s targets include a number of organizations and individuals located in Russia, an airline in China, an organization in Sweden, and an embassy in Belgium. The Remsec malware used by Strider has a modular design. Its modules work together as a framework that provides the attackers with complete control over an infected computer, allowing them to move across a network, exfiltrate data, and deploy custom modules as required. Remsec contains a number of stealth features that help it to avoid detection. Several of its components are in the form of executable blobs (Binary Large Objects), which are more difficult for traditional antivirus software to detect. In addition to this, much of the malware’s functionality is deployed over the network, meaning it resides only in a computer’s memory and is never stored on disk. This also makes the malware more difficult to detect and indicates that the Strider group are technically competent attackers. Remsec modules seen by Symantec to date include: Strider is capable of creating custom malware tools and has operated below the radar for at least five years. Based on the espionage capabilities of its malware and the nature of its known targets, it is possible that the group is a nation-state level attacker. Symantec will continue to search for more Remsec modules and targets in order to build upon our understanding of Strider and better protect our customers. Symantec and Norton products detect this threat as Backdoor.Remsec. The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "title": "swift malware financial attacks",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/swift-malware-financial-attacks",
    "content": "Symantec has found evidence that a bank in the Philippines has also been attacked by the group that stole US$81 million from the Bangladesh central bank and attempted to steal over $1 million from the Tien Phong Bank in Vietnam. Malware used by the group was also deployed in targeted attacks against a bank in the Philippines. In addition to this, some of the tools used share code similarities with malware used in historic attacks linked to a threat group known as Lazarus. The attacks can be traced back as far as October 2015, two months prior to the discovery of the failed attack in Vietnam, which was hitherto the earliest known incident. The attack against the Bangladesh central banktriggered an alert by payments network SWIFT, after it was found the attackers had used malware to cover up evidence of fraudulent transfers.SWIFT issued a further warning, saying that it had found evidence of malware being used against another bank in a similar fashion.Vietnam’s Tien Phong Bank subsequently statedthat it intercepted a fraudulent transfer of over $1 million in the fourth quarter of last year. SWIFT concluded that the second attack indicates that a “wider and highly adaptive campaign” is underway targeting banks. A third bank, Banco del Austro in Ecuador,was also reported to have lost $12 million to attackersusing fraudulent SWIFT transactions. However, no details are currently known about the tools used in this incident or if there are any links to the attacks in Asia. Symantec has identified three pieces of malware which were being used in limited targeted attacks against the financial industry in South-East Asia: Backdoor.Fimlis, Backdoor.Fimlis.B, and Backdoor.Contopee. At first, it was unclear what the motivation behind these attacks were, however code sharing between Trojan.Banswift (used in the Bangladesh attack used to manipulate SWIFT transactions) and early variants of Backdoor.Contopee provided a connection. While analyzing samples of Trojan.Banswift, a distinct file wiping code was found. Some of the distinctive properties of the wiping code include: Already this code looked fairly unique. What was even more interesting was that when we searched for additional malware containing the exact combination of “control” bytes, an early variant of Backdoor.Contopee and the“msoutc.exe”sample already discussed inthe recent BAE bloganalyzing the Bangladesh attack were also found. Symantec believes distinctive code shared between families and the fact that Backdoor.Contopee was being used in limited targeted attacks against financial institutions in the region, means these tools can be attributed to the same group. Backdoor.Contopee has been previously used by attackers associated with a broad threat group known as Lazarus.Lazarus has been linked to a string of aggressive attacks since 2009, largely focused on targets in the US and South Korea. The group was linked to Backdoor.Destover, a highly destructive Trojan that was the subject of an FBI warning after it was used in an attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. The FBI concluded that the North Korean governmentwas responsible for this attack. The group was the target of a cross-industry initiative known as Operation Blockbuster earlier this year, which involved major security vendors sharing intelligence and resources in order to assist commercial and government organizations in protecting themselves against Lazarus. As part of the initiative, vendors are circulating malware signatures and other useful intelligence related to these attackers. The discovery of more attacks provides further evidence that the group involved is conducting a wide campaign against financial targets in the region. While awareness of the threat posed by the group has now been raised, its initial success may prompt other attack groups to launch similar attacks. Banks and other financial institutions should remain vigilant. Symantec and Norton products protect against these threats with the following detections: The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "title": "tick cyberespionage japan",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/tick-cyberespionage-japan",
    "content": "A longstanding cyberespionage campaign has been targeting mainly Japanese organizations with its own custom-developed malware (Backdoor.Daserf). The group, known to Symantec as Tick, has maintained a low profile, appearing to be active for at least 10 years prior to discovery. In its most recent campaign, Tick employed spear-phishing emails and compromised a number of Japanese websites in order to infect a new wave of victims. The group is highly selective in its approach and only appears to deploy its full range of tools once it establishes that the compromised organization is an intended target. Tick also uses a range of hacktools to map the victim’s network and attempt to escalate privileges further. Daserf’s main purpose is information stealing and the Trojan is capable of gathering information from infected computers and relaying it back to attacker-controlled servers. Tick’s most recent attacks have concentrated on the technology, aquatic engineering, and broadcasting sectors in Japan. Symantec discovered the most recent wave of Tick attacks in July 2015, when the group compromised three different Japanese websites with a Flash (.swf) exploit to mount watering hole attacks. Visitors to these websites were infected with a downloader known as Gofarer (Downloader.Gofarer). Gofarer collects information about the compromised computer and then downloads and installs Daserf. Tick also used spear-phishing emails in these recent attacks. While Symantec did not find the emails themselves, it did identify the use of an exploit designed to take advantage of a vulnerability in Microsoft Office documents (CVE-2014-4114). This was used to distribute malware in addition to the watering hole activity. Daserf appears to be custom-developed for use in Tick’s cyberespionage campaigns. Once installed, it establishes a remote connection to Tick’s command and control server, providing the attacker with access to the compromised computer. Once the malware is installed on a targeted computer, the attackers attempt to enumerate the network and escalate their privilege level. To do this, Tick uses a number of publicly available hacktools such as Mimikatz, GSecdump, and Windows Credential Editor. The tools are downloaded and deployed to the original install directory previously created by the malware. Tick’s primary objective appears to be the theft of sensitive information from targeted Japanese organizations. To date, Symantec has observed the group attempting to steal emails and documents such as PowerPoint presentations. The Daserf Trojan employs a number of tactics to avoid detection. Once collected, the stolen data is hidden in password-protected .rar archives. Daserf also uses file and folder names related to legitimate programs often found in Windows environments in order to blend in. Observed folder names include HP, Intel, Adobe, and perflogs and folders are generally created in either the root drive or the Application Data or Program Files folders. File names used in recent attacks include adobe.exe, adobe_sl.exe, intel.exe, and intellog.exe. Tick uses compromised web servers to distribute malware and, in some instances, for its command and control (C&C) infrastructure. However, in most cases, it relies on its own infrastructure for C&C purposes. In its most recent campaigns, the group registered the domains used for C&C servers days after the malware was compiled. For example, one of the variants of Daserf used was compiled on July 8, 2015. This sample was seen contacting the C&C domain www[.]dreamsig[.]com, which was first registered on July 13, 2015, five days after the compilation date. This pattern occurred in multiple Daserf samples. Another interesting aspect of the communication between the malware and the C&C infrastructure is how the malware changes the URL from a randomly chosen variable selected from a predefined list. Predefined list from Daserf MD5: 765017E16842C9EB6860A7E9F711B0DB Symantec identified multiple C&C domains used by Tick. Unfortunately, Tick frequently used either privacy protection services or domain brokers to mask registration information. These tactics are used to make discovery and attribution more difficult. The majority of the malware analyzed was not digitally signed. However, a small percentage was signed with a stolen digital certificate. It is unclear why the certificate was used so sparingly, since signed malware would receive a greater level of trust and reduce the risk of detection. It is possible that the certificate was used against a target that had a secure environment which may have required binaries to be signed in order to interact with the operating system. The issuer of the certificate has been informed of its misuse and confirmed that it would be revoked. The use of compromised websites to infect victims results in unintentional infections, making it difficult to identify the motives of the attacker. By searching for evidence of post-infection activity, Symantec identified seven organizations where Tick had mounted persistent post-compromise attacks. These organizations were primarily large Japanese technology, engineering, and media firms. The seven organizations therefore appear to be Tick’s intended targets. In addition to seeing post-compromise tools used in these attacks, the length of time the attackers were active on the networks provided additional evidence that these were high-value targets. The longest time Tick was active in a victim’s environment was 18 months. The average timeframe was five months and the number of infected hosts in a victim’s network ranged from 3 to 15 systems. Tick has left a trail of evidence indicating that its activity began as early as 2006. In earlier attacks, the group used malicious Microsoft Word documents to infect victims, with compromised websites being added to the mix as a more recent attack vector. Tick appears to be a well-organized group, with the funding and capability to develop and update its malware. It has the ability to compromise legitimate infrastructure to use for malware distribution and has access to stolen digital certificates to sign its malware when needed. Tick primarily uses purchased infrastructure for its C&C servers and has been able to stay off the radar since 2006. Tick exhibits all the hallmarks of an advanced cyberespionage group. The long lifespan of the group, as well as the consistent targeted attacks against specific industries, support this theory. The individuals or organization behind Tick’s operations has an interest in Japanese technology along with Japanese media and broadcasting organizations. While Tick’s tactics may change over time, the group’s history indicates that its focus will continue to be a narrow range of targets, mainly in Japan. Symantec and Norton products protect against these threats with the following detections: Intrusion prevention system The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "title": "taiwan cyberespionage backdoor trojan",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/taiwan-cyberespionage-backdoor-trojan",
    "content": "In late August 2015, Symantec identified a previously unknown back door Trojan (Backdoor.Dripion) infecting organizations primarily located in Taiwan, as well as Brazil and the United States. Dripion is custom-built, designed to steal information, and has been used sparingly in a limited number of targeted attacks. The attackers behind this campaign went to some lengths to disguise their activities, including using domains names disguised as antivirus (AV) company websites for their command and control (C&C) servers. These attacks have some links to earlier attacks by a group called Budminer involving the Taidoor Trojan (Trojan.Taidoor). The threat posed by custom malware such as Dripion illustrates the value of multilayered security. Unknown threats may evade signature-based detection, but can be blocked by other detection tools which identify malicious behavior. Our investigation began when we received three file hashes, which we determined to have the functionality of a back door with information-stealing capabilities. The malware appeared to be new, rarely detected, and not publicly available. As we analyzed the binary and compared it against other known back door Trojans, we realized this was custom-developed malware. Developing a back door with information-stealing capabilities designed to evade detection requires both knowledge and funding. Usually when we see a new back door Trojan like this, it is tied to organizations involved in cyberespionage campaigns. One of the first steps taken when investigating malware is to determine how it is getting onto a victim’s computer. Many publicly available downloaders exist; however, only a few unique downloaders have been used over the past few years that have been exclusive to cyberespionage activity. Since Dripion appeared to be used by a single attacker against a small target group, we wanted to determine if the downloader could provide additional evidence to help attribute the threat to any known threat groups. The downloader was identified as Downloader.Blugger (MD5: 260f19ef39d56373bb5590346d2c1811). It is not a new piece of malware, having been in existence since at least 2011. How the victim was infected with Blugger is currently unknown. Blugger used encryption to make its infrastructure and commands queried in the URL requests harder to detect. After decrypting however, we identified the following URL requests: Both of the domains we analyzed in the URLs requested by the downloader are publicly accessible blogs. The downloader contacts these blog URLs in order to retrieve Dripion for installation. The blog posts are primarily in English yet most of the targets are based in Taiwan. As illustrated in Figure 1, one of the blogs references US healthcare spending.  It is unknown if the attacker created the blog or simply compromised another to use in their attacks. If the blog was compromised, then the attacker likely would not create posts themselves as it would show the blog’s creator that something was awry. If the blog was created by the attacker, it may be an attempt to develop a blog with topics that would likely be of interest to the intended target. Most of the blogs were related to news events. The Dripion back door TrojanOnce Dripion is installed, the attacker can access the user’s computer. Dripion has the functionally of a back door Trojan, letting attackers upload, download, and steal pre-determined information from the victim, and execute remote commands. Information such as the victim’s computer name and IP address are automatically transmitted to the C&C server upon the initial infection. GoSleepSleeps for 10 minutes GoKillAttempts to delete itself and ends its activities GoByeDisconnects from the computer nodataSimilar to GoBye CommandExecute command (lpCommandLine in CreateProcessA), redirect result through pipe to .tmp file and Download file UpFileWrite data in file on victim's computer DownFileWrite data to a remote open file (InternetWriteFile). The .tmp file used may be deleted after success operation. ExecuteFileCreate a new process (CreateProcessA) Table1. Commands associated with the Dripion malware Additionally, the developer of the Dripion malware used XOR encoding for both the binary configuration file (XOR: 0xA8) as well as network requests with the C&C server (XOR: 0xA3), to make detection more difficult. Dripion has been identified in multiple variations and has version numbers hardcoded within the malware. This indicates that the attackers have the ability to both create and develop their own custom malware as well as update their code to provide new capabilities and make detection more difficult. The use of publicly accessible blogs to distribute malware is a tactic we have seen previously, but few cyberespionage groups have used this technique. Fewer still have used this strategy to deliver custom-developed malware not often seen in the wild. The first piece of evidence pointing towards a link with previous cyberespionage campaigns was the use of the Blugger downloader, which has only been used by a group Symantec calls Budminer. This group has used Blugger to distribute its own custom malware known as Taidoor (Trojan.Taidoor). Symantec haspreviously written about Budminer’s Taidoor campaigns. Significantly, this is the first time we have seen Blugger used to deliver malware other than Taidoor. Further investigation uncovered a second tie with earlier Budminer activity. One of the Blugger samples associated with Dripion connected with a root domain also used in Taidoor-related activity. Both of the URL queries originated from the Blugger downloader which connected to the blog classic-blog.[REDACTED DOMAIN 1].com. They then call out to subdomains of the domain [REDACTED DOMAIN 3].net. Both Dripion and Taidoor not only connected to the same website (classic-blog.[REDACTED DOMAIN 1].com) but also used the same URL (classic-blog.[REDACTED DOMAIN 1].com /nasyzk/[ENCODED TEXT]) to obtain the encrypted C&C configuration. Symantec first identified activity involving Dripion in September 2015. Based on the timestamp of the earliest known sample however, Dripion may have been in existence since 2013. The Dripion activity that we have analyzed is extremely targeted and has involved far fewer victims compared to the number of users infected with Taidoor. The similarity between the two sets of activity is the number of unique file hashes found infecting users located in Taiwan. Unfortunately, we need more data to determine if the timestamps associated with Dripion dating back to November 2013 (7ad3b2b6eee18af6816b6f4f7f7f71a6) are legitimate or if they have been forged. The earliest known Dripion activity we were able to validate took place in November 2014. Despite the one-year gap in activity, it is possible that campaigns involving Dripion happened during this period and went undetected due to its small target window. Another interesting tactic used to deceive potential targets lies within the C&C infrastructure. The attackers created multiple domains with names similar to that of legitimate companies and websites in the antivirus community. For example the domains hyydn.nortonsoft[.]com and  mhysix.mcfeesoft[.]com were both C&C domains used in attacks. Using typo-squat domains to mimic legitimate sites is a tactic frequently used to trick the targets as well as defenders, in an effort to make the domains blend in with normal activity. We began this investigation with what we believed was a new campaign using an unidentified back door Trojan against targets primarily in Taiwan. As the investigation grew we found multiple ties between this newly discovered attack and activity associated with the Budminer cyberespionage group: We compared Dripion against Taidoor malware samples to determine if there was any shared code or if it may have originated from the same developer. Our findings concluded there were no similarities between the two malware families. However, the downloader used by both malware families has unique attributes, and we believe it to be from the same developer. So what does all this mean? Attribution of cyberespionage groups is difficult and needs to be done carefully based on fact and not assumptions. We have a number of ties between the two sets of activity.  Not all of the ties are strong on their own, but together provide a strong case that there is a relationship between the groups targeting Taiwan using Dripion and Taidoor malware. Based on the evidence we have presented Symantec attributed the activity involving the Dripion malware to the Budminer advanced threat group. While we have not seen new campaigns using Taidoor malware since 2014, we believe the Budminer group has changed tactics to avoid detection after being outed publicly in security white papers and blogs over the past few years. This investigation is just one example of Symantec’s ongoing effort to identify unknown emerging threats. By remaining one step ahead of adversaries, we can protect customers with intelligence-driven security. Symantec and Norton products protect against these threats with the following detections: The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

Symantec has been tracking attacks associated with Lazarus since 2009. It has been linked to a wide range of incidents, several of which involved highly destructive malware. Lazarus appears to be particularly focused on targets in the US and South Korea. Announced today, Operation Blockbuster involves major security vendors sharing intelligence and resources in order to assist commercial and government organizations in protecting themselves against Lazarus. As part of the initiative, vendors will circulate malware signatures and other useful intelligence related to these attackers. Active since at least 2009, Lazarus is a well-resourced adversary, capable of mounting cyberespionage operations in addition to high-profile destructive attacks. There is some evidence to suggest that Lazarus may consist of several associated groups of attackers. If this is the case, then it is possible that these groups are acting in concert, under the direction of one entity. Lazarus has been linked to a series of attacks since 2009. Symantec has observed commonalities between multiple targeted campaigns it may have been involved with. Lazarus is notable for its use of aggressive and destructive tactics, such as the use of disk-wiping malware, to cause maximum disruption to its targets One of the earliest attacks linked to Lazarus occurred when distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS) attacks knockeda number of US and South Korean websites offline. A Trojan known as Dozer (detected by Symantec as Trojan.Dozer) mounted the DDoS attacks using computers it had previously compromised. Dozer was spread through emails in a campaign involving a number of worms (detected as W32.Dozer, W32.Mydoom.A@mm, and W32.Mytob!gen). A similar wave of DDoS attacks hit South Korean websites in 2011, this time involving more destructive malware known as Trojan.Koredos. The Koredos Trojan not only used the infected computer to mount DDoS attacks; it also wiped the computer after a short period of time. Upon infection, the Trojan scanned for a number of different file types and copied them into an inaccessible encrypted .cab file before deleting the originals. A number of files that the Trojan searched for were related to software predominantly used in Korea (e.g. .alz, .gul, and .hwp). After this, the Trojan delivered the coup de grâce by deleting the master boot record (MBR) on all connected drives between 7 and 10 days after the initial infection. This resulted in Windows being unable to restart, effectively rending the computer unusable. Lazarus was also linked to aseries of destructive attacks against a number of South Korean corporations in 2013. Banks, broadcasters, and telecoms companies were among those affected. The attacks were reported to have compromised the targets’ servers with a disk-wiping Trojan (detected by Symantec as Trojan.Jokra). In addition to this, one telecoms firm had its website defaced with an animated image of skulls and a message from the alleged attackers, who called themselves the “Whois” team. Aggressive attacks linked to Lazarus continued in 2014and the group was linked to Backdoor.Destover, a highly destructive Trojan that was the subject of an FBI warning after it was used in an attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. The FBI concluded that the North Korean governmentwas responsible for this attack. Although used against US targets, Destover shared several links to earlier attacks directed at targets in South Korea. Some samples of Destover reported to a command and control (C&C) server that was also used by a version of Trojan.Volgmer, which was crafted to attack South Korean targets. The shared C&C server indicated that the same group may have been behind both attacks. An updated version of this malware (detected as Trojan.Volgmer.B) has been used in more recent attacks against large South Korean companies. Some of the most recent activity linked to Lazarusinvolved a Trojan detected as Backdoor.Duuzer. Although detected in a range of locations, one of the threat’s targets was the South Korean manufacturing industry. Duuzer’s main function appears to be cyberespionage. The Trojan provides attackers with remote access to the compromised computer, and allows them to download additional files and steal data. There was also some evidence to suggest that the attackers behind Duuzer were spreading two other threats, detected as W32.Brambul and Backdoor.Joanap, to target more organizations in South Korea. Both pieces of malware appear to be designed to download extra payloads and carry out reconnaissance on infected computers. Ongoing vigilance requiredAttacks associated with Lazarus have frequently been highly destructive. Aside from the level of aggression displayed, Lazarus is notable for the range of tools used and the fact that it is linked to destructive attacks and lower-profile, espionage operations. By pooling together our respective insights into Lazarus, Symantec and other members of the Operation Blockbuster team hopes to strike a blow to this group while ensuring that our customers have robust protection against its tools. ProtectionSymantec and Norton products protect against threats associated with Lazarus with the following detections: Intrusion prevention system The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "title": "dridex financial trojan spam",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/dridex-financial-trojan-spam",
    "content": "Tidal waves of spam are fuelling the growth of the Dridex Trojan, which has emerged as one of the most dangerous financial threats over the past year. The sheer size of the spam campaigns spreading Dridex (detected by Symantec as W32.Cridex) can sometimes overwhelm organizations hit by them. Symantec analysis of recent Dridex spam campaigns found that they are operating on a vast scale, with millions of new emails being sent out on a daily basis. The attackers behind Dridex are disciplined and professional. They operate on a standard working week, continually refine the malware, and put significant effort into disguising their spam campaigns as legitimate emails. As detailed in a newSymantec whitepaperpublished today, at least 145 Dridex spam campaigns were observed during one sample 10-week period. The average number of emails blocked by Symantec per campaign was 271,019, indicating that the total number of emails being sent every day runs to millions. Almost three quarters (74 percent) of Dridex spam campaigns used real company names in the sender address and frequently in the email text. The vast majority of spam campaigns were disguised as financial emails, such as invoices, receipts, and orders. The spam was heavily focused on English speakers, with the majority of emails purporting to come from English-speaking companies. Dridex is mainly used to steal banking credentials. The malware is configured to target the customers of nearly 300 different organizations in over 40 regions. Dridex is heavily focused on customers of financial institutions in wealthy, English-speaking countries, with the majority of targeted organizations located in these countries. The attackers also prioritized other European nations, along with a range of Asia-Pacific regions. The number of Dridex infections detected by Symantec rose during 2015. Between January and April, there were less than 2,000 infections per month. Infection numbers spiked considerably in the following months, hitting almost 16,000 in June before dropping and stabilizing at a rate of 3,000 to 5,000 per month in the final quarter. Dridex infections were detected in a wide range of regions during 2015. English-speaking countries, such as the US, UK, and Australia experienced high rates of infection. This was due to how the attackers configured the malware to attack the large number of banks in these regions, as well as the number of English-language spam campaigns spreading the Dridex Trojan. Western European countries, including France, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland also experienced high infection rates. The level of activity surrounding Dridex indicates that a large cybercrime group is behind the malware. The US Department of Justicehas said that the botnet is “run by criminals in Moldova and elsewhere.” In October 2015,an international law enforcement operationsaw one man charged alongside a coordinated effort to sinkhole thousands of compromised computers, cutting them off from the botnet’s control. It appears this may have only been a partial success as Dridex continues to propagate, indicating that many key elements of the operation are still functioning. The group is likely to continue to pose a serious threat during 2016. A multi-layered defense strategy maximizes protection against aggressive threats such as Dridex. The following Symantec and Norton products will help guard against infection: Intrusion prevention system detections For more information and a detailed analysis of the Dridex threat, read our whitepaper: The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "title": "dyre bank fraud group takedown",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/dyre-bank-fraud-group-takedown",
    "content": "The cybercrime group controlling the Dyre financial fraud Trojan appears to have suffered a major blow followinga Russian law enforcement operation in November. Symantec telemetry has confirmed a virtual cessation of the group’s activities. Dyre (detected by Symantec as Infostealer.Dyre) is spread through email spam campaigns and no Dyre-related spam campaigns have been observed since November 18. Detections of the Dyre Trojan and associated malware have also dropped dramatically since mid-November. Dyre is primarily spread through email spam campaigns, most of which masquerade as business documents, voicemail, or fax messages. The Dyre group had been running email campaigns on most weekdays, dispatching between one and 15 separate email campaigns per day. However, Dyre-related spam campaigns halted abruptly on November 18 and none have been observed since then, indicating a major disruption in the group’s operations. Dyre spam campaigns come with a malicious attachment, which, if opened, will install the Upatre downloader on their computer (detected by Symantec as Downloader.Upatre). Upatre collects information about the victim’s computer, attempts to disable security software, and finally downloads and installs the Dyre Trojan. The Dyre group has been one of the main users of Upatre in over the past year. Symantec telemetry indicates a huge fall in the number of Upatre infections since November. The monthly infection rate has fallen below 20,000, after reaching a high of more than 250,000 per month in July 2015. The number of infections involving the Dyre Trojan itself has also dropped off significantly in the same period. The infection rate was running above 9,000 a month in early 2015. Since November it has fallen to below 600 per month. Prior to this takedown, Dyre had emerged as one of the most dangerous financial fraud operations. The Dyre Trojan is configured to defraud the customers of more than 1,000 banks and other companies worldwide. Consumers in English speaking countries, in particular the US and UK were most at risk, since this is where the largest numbers of targeted banks were located. Dyre targets Windows computers and can defraud victims by snooping on their online banking sessions, stealing their credentials, and sending them back to the attackers. Dyre is also used to infect victims with additional malware and Symantec has to date seen at least seven other malware families being pushed out to infected computers. In many cases, the victim is added to a botnet, which is then used to power further spam campaigns and infect more victims. The move against Dyre appears to be one of the most successful of a number of recent takedown operations against similar financial fraud threats. Unless all of the key figures are arrested and major infrastructure seized, cybercrime groups can quickly rebuild their operations in the aftermath of a law enforcement swoop. For example,an October 2015 operation against Dridex, one of the other major financial fraud Trojans currently in operation, appears to have had a limited impact on its operations. While one man was charged and thousands of compromised computers were sinkholed, the rate of Dridex infections did not abate following the takedown. Early indications are that the operation against Dyre has been quite successful, with no sign of the group attempting to re-establish itself. Whether the threat will disappear entirely will become apparent in the coming months.

Symantec telemetry confirms that several computers in a major Ukrainian media company were compromised by Disakil in late October and may have been destroyed by the malware. One computer at the media company was compromised by a new variant of the BlackEnergy Trojan (detected by Symantec as Backdoor.Lancafdo). The attackers appear to have used this infection to retrieve administrator credentials and used them to execute Disakil on a number of computers.  Communication from these computers halted after Disakil was executed, suggesting that it succeeded in wiping them and rendering them inoperable. The group behind the Black Energy Trojan isknown as Sandworm and has a history of targeting organizations in Ukraine. It has also been known to attack NATO, a number of Western European countries, and companies operating in the energy sector. While Symantec does not have telemetry relating to more recent Disakil targets, the malware has been linked by others to attacks in late December against the energy sector in the Ukraine, which led to power outages in the country. Apress statementon theSecurity Service of Ukraine(SBU) website, alleged the discovery of malicious software responsible for these outages on the networks of regional power companies.  According to the SBU press statement, the cyberattack was accompanied by a barrage of phone calls to their technical support telephone numbers, which would have acted like a denial of service (DoS) attack. Ablogfrom the SANS ICS team meanwhile reported that it received a sample of Disakil from a trusted source which was used in one of the attacks, on December 23. While Symantec cannot confirm Disakil has been used in any cyberattack causing power outages at this time, we can confirm its destructive nature. Disakil is a multi-stage threat whose main characteristic is its appetite for destruction. If executed, it sets about rendering the infected system unusable by using a number of relatively simple but effective techniques such as overwriting the MBR (Master Boot Record) and overwriting certain file types with junk data. It also attempts to cover its tracks by clearing Windows log files and destroying the malware structure before restarting the system. A notable feature of Disakil is that it attempts to stop and delete a service named “sec_service”.   This service appears to belong to ‘Serial to Ethernet Connector’ software byEltima. This software allows access to remote serial ports over network connections.  A lot of legacy SCADA systems still use serial ports forRTU(Remote Terminal Unit or Remote Telemetry Unit) communications. This software is the type of solution a company would implement in their environment for communicating remotely with these legacy devices. According tomanufacturers, RTU features can include discrete alarms to monitor device failure, redundant backup communication for monitoring during a LAN failure and analog alarm inputs which monitor voltage, temperature, humidity and pressure.  Hypothetically, if an attacker knew that their target was using this software for communicating with their legacy SCADA devices, stopping the service and any communications would increase the potential for damage within their environment. Attacks of this nature against the energy sector are not unheard-of. In 2012 Symantec reported on theShamoon attacks, where at least one organization in the energy sector was attacked using very similar techniques to render the targeted system unusable. The destructive capabilities of Disakil would make it ideal for use in any attack looking to inflict severe damage to a target’s environment.

    "content": "An international law enforcement crackdown against the Dridex botnet has seen one man charged and a coordinated effort to sinkhole thousands of compromised computers, cutting them off from the botnet’s control. The operation, which involvedthe FBI in the US, the UK National Crime Agency, and a number of other international agencies, may seriously disrupt a cybercrime enterprise which has stolen tens of millions of dollars from victims worldwide. Dridex, which is detected by Symantec as W32.Cridex and also known as Bugat, is a financial threat that adds the infected computer to a botnet and injects itself into the victim’s web browser in order to steal information, including banking credentials. The malware is usually spread through phishing emails designed to appear to come from legitimate sources in order to lure the victim into opening a malicious attachment. It is also capable of self-replication by copying itself to mapped network drives and attached local storage such as USB keys. As is common with most financial attackers, the Dridex group regularly changed its tactics and most recently has been observed using malicious macros in Microsoft Office documents attached to emails to infect computers. As reported in Symantec’sState of financial Trojans 2014whitepaper, Dridex was the third-largest financial threat last year, accounting for some 29,000 detections. Nevertheless, this represented a decrease, with the number of infections down 88 percent since 2012. Recent telemetry suggests that the threat has enjoyed something of a resurgence in activity, with detections beginning to increase again in the past few months. The attackers behind Dridex have targeted a broad range of countries. The largest number of detections in 2015 was in the US. This was followed by Japan and Germany, with significant numbers of infections also seen in the UK, Canada, Australia, and a number of other European countries. Yesterday’s operation saw a 30-year-old Moldovan man charged by prosecutors in the US for offences including criminal conspiracy, unauthorized computer access with intent to defraud, damaging a computer, wire fraud, and bank fraud. His extradition to the US is currently being sought following his arrest in Cyprus in August. The FBI also obtained an injunction permitting it to start sinkholing Dridex infections by redirecting traffic from infected computers away from command-and-control (C&C) servers to benign substitute servers. This sinkholing operation is also being supported by the UK National Crime Agency. This is the latest in a series of recent takedowns against major financial fraud cybercrime groups, following earlier operations againstGameover Zeus,Shylock, andRamnit.

    "title": "regin mysteries cyberespionage",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/regin-mysteries-cyberespionage",
    "content": "Symantec’s continuing investigation into the Regin Trojan has cast new light on the cyberespionage tool, revealing a wider range of capabilities and a complex infrastructure supporting the threat. Regin was uncovered last year by Symantecand remains one of the most advanced spying tools discovered to date. The malware has been in circulation since at least 2008 and has been used against a range of targets, including government organizations, infrastructure operators, businesses, researchers, and private individuals. Regin is a five-stage threat, with each stage loading and decrypting the next one. The malware is modular in structure, which allows its controllers to add and remove specific features depending on the target. Some Regin modules control basic functions of the malware, such as networking or handling Regin’s encrypted virtual file system (EVFS). Other modules act as payloads, dictating the functionality of each Regin infection. As outlined in an updated technical whitepaper, Symantec has found 49 new modules, bringing the total number of Regin modules uncovered to 75. This remains an incomplete list. A number of other Regin payloads are known to exist since some modules analyzed contain references to them. Symantec has found an extensive command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure supporting Regin infections. The attackers have devised a complex system for communication with C&C servers, in which traffic is relayed through a network of Regin-infected computers. Compromised computers can act as a proxy for other infected computers and peer-to-peer (P2P) communications are used. The networking protocols used by the malware are extensible and can be configured between each pair of Regin-infected computers, providing the attackers with a granular level of control over C&C communications. All C&C communications use strong encryption and follow a two-stage protocol, where the attackers contact the infected computer on one channel and instruct it to open communications on another. A single Regin module (0009h) is responsible for the core handling of communications protocols, while each individual protocol has its own separate module. A total of six transport protocols have been identified: ICMP, UDP, TCP, HTTP Cookies, SSL, and SMB. Regin’s P2P communications capability sees each Regin infection assigned a virtual IP address, forming a virtual private network (VPN) on top of the physical network of the infected computer. This P2P capability allows the attackers to maintain deep access to critical assets within compromised organizations and mask core infrastructure belonging to the group. Traffic between nodes can be configured to match expected protocols based on where the nodes are placed on a network, adding a further degree of stealth to communications. Regin’s authors facilitate communication between modules with a lightweight remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism. This RPC mechanism appears to be custom-built. The RPC mechanism allows for procedure calls to be made locally and across the network of Regin-infected computers. Operators can directly call any procedure on the Regin network to remotely control, install, or update modules, or change module configuration by replacing EVFS files. Despite the threat’s exposure last year, it is unlikely that the group behind this malware has ceased operations. Its track record and available resources mean it is probable that the group will re-equip itself with a new threat or upgrade Regin in a bid to evade detection. The latter is the most likely course of action, given the time it would take to develop an equally capable malware framework from scratch. In terms of technical capabilities, Regin was several years ahead of most other threats. Its impact may continue to be felt as other, less advanced threat actors draw inspiration from it and copy its features in a bid to improve their own tools. Indicators of compromise for security administrators and more detailed technical information can be found in our updated technical paper−Regin: Top-tier espionage tool enables stealthy surveillance Symantec and Norton products detect this threat as Backdoor.Regin.

    "title": "black vine cyberespionage aerospace healthcare",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/black-vine-cyberespionage-aerospace-healthcare",
    "content": "Earlier this year, the second-largest health insurance provider in the US publicly disclosed that it had been the victim of a major cyberattack. The attack against Anthem resulted in the largest known healthcare data breach to date, with80 million patient records exposed. Symantec believes that the attackers behind the Anthem breach are part of a highly resourceful cyberespionage group called Black Vine. The Anthem attack is only one of multiple campaigns that Symantec has attributed to this group. Symantec’slatest whitepaperdocuments multiple Black Vine operations that have been occurring since 2012. Black Vine’s targets include gas turbine manufacturers, large aerospace and aviation companies, healthcare providers, and more. The group has access to zero-day exploits, most likely obtained through theElderwood framework, and uses custom-developed back door malware. By connecting multiple Black Vine campaigns, we traced how the attack group has evolved over the last three years. Black Vine’s attacks to date delivered exploits for the following zero-day vulnerabilities, primarily through watering-hole attacks: In its campaigns, Black Vine compromised legitimate websites that were of interest to its targets in order to serve exploits to the sites’ visitors. If the zero-day exploits successfully worked against the vulnerable software on the victim’s computer, then they dropped Black Vine’s custom malware, providing the attackers with remote access to the computer. In addition to watering-hole attacks, Black Vine also sent spear-phishing emails that disguised its threats using technology-themed lures. Black Vine has compromised companies in the following industries: The vast majority of Black Vine malware infections were located in the US, followed by China, Canada, Italy, Denmark, and India. Symantec observed Black Vine using three types of custom malware throughout its campaigns: Hurix and Sakurel (both detected as Trojan.Sakurel), and Mivast (detected as Backdoor.Mivast). All three threats can perform the following actions: Our analysis suggests that Black Vine is well resourced, as the group is capable of frequently updating and modifying its malware to avoid detection. During our analysis, we noticed that Black Vine used certain zero-day exploits at the same time that other attack groups used them. The other campaigns have been previously investigated by Symantec, such asone by Hidden Lynx. While these campaigns included the same zero-day exploits, they delivered different payloads unique to each attack group. The fact that these different adversaries simultaneously used the same exploits suggests that they all have access to a common zero-day exploit distribution framework. Symantec has previously identified the framework in question as the Elderwood platform. We first researched the platform in 2012 and observed how it has been continuously updated with the latest zero-day exploits ever since. In 2014, we discovered thatseveral attack groups were likely using the Elderwood framework, rather than just one. All of the campaigns that leveraged Elderwood’s zero-day exploits have been attributed to attackers based in China. Other reports suggestthat some of the actors involved in Black Vine’s activity may have had connections with a Beijing-based IT security firm called Topsec. Black Vine is a formidable, highly resourced attack group which is equipped to conduct cyberespionage against targeted organizations. Based on our records of its past campaigns, Symantec believes that Black Vine’s malicious activity will continue. We hope that our whitepaper will allow organizations to better understand the risk that this attack group poses, helping them to develop stronger defenses for their sensitive information. Symantec has the following detections in place to protect against Black Vine’s malware: Intrusion prevention system For a complete account of Symantec’s investigation into Black Vine and its campaigns,please read our whitepaper.

    "content": "Symantec has uncovered an elusive Trojan used by the cyberespionage group behind the “Duke” family of malware. Seaduke (detected by Symantec as Trojan.Seaduke) is a low-profile information-stealing Trojan which appears to be reserved for attacks against a small number of high-value targets. Seaduke has been used in attacks against a number of major, government-level targets. The malware hides behind numerous layers of encryption and obfuscation and is capable of quietly stealing and exfiltrating sensitive information such as email from the victim’s computer. Seaduke has a highly configurable framework and Symantec has already found hundreds of different configurations on compromised networks. Its creators are likely to have spent a considerable amount of time and resources in preparing these attacks and the malware has been deployed against a number of high-level government targets. While the Duke group began to distribute Cozyduke in an increasingly aggressive manner, Seaduke installations were reserved only for select targets. Seaduke victims are generally first infected with Cozyduke and, if the computer appears to be a target of interest, the operators will install Seaduke. The group behind Seaduke is a cyberespionage operation that is responsible for a series of attacks against high-profile individuals and organizations in government, international policy and private research in the United States and Europe. It has a range of malware tools at its disposal, known as the Dukes, including Cozyduke (Trojan.Cozer), Miniduke (Backdoor.Miniduke) and Cosmicduke (Backdoor.Tinybaron). News of the Duke group first emerged in  March and April of 2015, when reports detailing attacks involving a sophisticated threat actor variously called Office Monkeys,EuroAPT,Cozy Bear, andCozydukewere published. Symantec believes that this group has a history of compromising governmental and diplomatic organizations since at least 2010. The group began its current campaign as early as March 2014, when Trojan.Cozer (aka Cozyduke) was identified on the network of a private research institute in Washington, D.C. In the months that followed, the Duke group began to target victims with “Office Monkeys”- and “eFax”-themed emails, booby-trapped with a Cozyduke payload. These tactics were atypical of a cyberespionage group. It’s quite likely these themes were deliberately chosen to act as a smokescreen, hiding the true intent of the adversary. The Duke group has mounted an extended campaign targeting high-profile networks over extended periods, something which is far beyond the reach of the majority of threat actors. Its capabilities include: Although Cozyduke activity was first identified in March 2014, it wasn’t until July that the group managed to successfully compromise high-profile government networks. Cozyduke was used throughout these attacks to harvest and exfiltrate sensitive information to the attackers. In parallel, the Duke group was also installing separate malware onto these networks, namely Backdoor.Miniduke and the more elusive Trojan.Seaduke. It could use these payloads to exploit networks on multiple fronts and providing it with additional persistence mechanisms. In July of 2014, the group instructed Cozyduke-infected computers to install Backdoor.Miniduke onto a compromised network. Miniduke has been the group’s tool of choice for a number of years in espionage operations predominantly targeting government and diplomatic entities in Eastern Europe and ex-Soviet states.  “Nemesis Gemina” appears to be the internal name for the framework used by the group to identify the project, previously reported byKaspersky. The following debug string was present in the sample used in these attacks: This project name has been seen in Backdoor.Tinybaron (aka Cosmicduke) samples, which Symantec also attributes to the Duke group. This deployment of Miniduke and the technical similarities with Cozyduke provided strong indicators as to who was behind the attacks. These attacks were already well underway when another group began to deploy a previously unknown piece of malware. In October 2014, the Seaduke payload began to appear within target networks. Although Seaduke was developed in Python, the overall framework bears a striking resemblance to Cozyduke in terms of operation.  It’s unclear why the attackers waited until October to deploy Seaduke. Was it reserved for a more specific attack? Was part of their cover blown, necessitating the use of an alternative framework? The Seaduke framework was designed to be highly configurable. Hundreds of reconfigurations were identified on compromised networks. The communication protocol employed had many layers of encryption and obfuscation, using over 200 compromised web servers for command and control. Seaduke required a significant investment of time and resources in the preparatory and operational phases of the attack. The attackers control Cozyduke via compromised websites, issuing instructions to infected machines by uploading “tasks” to a database file. Cozyduke will periodically contact these websites to retrieve task information to be executed on the local machine.  One such task (an encoded PowerShell script) instructed Cozyduke to download and execute Seaduke from a compromised website. The attackers can operate Seaduke in a broadly similar fashion to Cozyduke. The Seaduke control infrastructure is essentially distinct, opening up the possibility of sub-teams concurrently exploiting the target network. Unlike Cozyduke, Seaduke operators upload “task” files directly to the command-and-control (C&C) server; there is no database as such present. Seaduke securely communicates with the C&C server over HTTP/HTTPS beneath layers of encoding (Base64) and encryption (RC4, AES). To an untrained eye, the communications look fairly benign, no doubt an effort to stay under the radar on compromised networks. Seaduke has many inbuilt commands which are available to the attackers. They have the ability to retrieve detailed bot/system information, update bot configuration, upload files, download files, and self-delete the malware from the system. The self-delete function is interestingly called “seppuku”. This is a form of Japanese ritual suicide. The attackers have also developed a number of additional payloads. Operators can push these payloads onto infected machines for very specific attacks. The Duke group has brought its operational capability to the next level. Its attacks have been so bold and aggressive, that a huge amount of attention has been drawn to it, yet it appears to be unperturbed.  Its success at compromising such high-profile targets has no doubt added a few feathers to its cap. Even the developers reveled in this fact, naming one of Seaduke’s functions “forkmeiamfamous”. While the group is currently keeping a lower profile, there’s no doubt it will reappear. Some tools may have to be abandoned, some reworked and others built completely from scratch. This attack group is in it for the long haul.

    "title": "butterfly corporate attacks",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/butterfly-corporate-attacks",
    "content": "Note:“Morpho” was used in the original publication to refer to this attack group. Symantec has renamed the group “Butterfly” to avoid any link whatsoever to other legitimate corporate entities named “Morpho” A corporate espionage group has compromised a string of major corporations over the past three years in order to steal confidential information and intellectual property. The gang, which Symantec calls Butterfly, is not-state sponsored, rather financially motivated. It has attacked multi-billion dollar companies operating in the internet, IT software, pharmaceutical, and commodities sectors. Twitter, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft are among the companies who have publicly acknowledged attacks. Butterfly is technically proficient and well resourced. The group has developed a suite of custom malware tools capable of attacking both Windows and Apple computers, and appears to have used at least one zero-day vulnerability in its attacks. It keeps a low profile and maintains good operational security. After successfully compromising a target organization, it cleans up after itself before moving on to its next target. This group operates at a much higher level than the average cybercrime gang. It is not interested in stealing credit card details or customer databases and is instead focused on high-level corporate information. Butterfly may be selling this information to the highest bidder or may be operating as hackers for hire. Stolen information could also be used for insider-trading purposes. The first signs of Butterfly’s activities emerged in early 2013 when several major technology and internet firms were compromised.Twitter,Facebook,Appleand Microsoft disclosed that they had been compromised by very similar attacks. The attackers attacked victims by compromising a website used by mobile developers and using a Java zero-day exploit to infect them with malware. The malware used in these attacks was a Mac OS X back door known as OSX.Pintsized. Subsequent analysis by security researcher Eric Romang identified a Windows back door, Backdoor.Jiripbot, which was also used in the attacks. Following this flurry of publicity, the Butterfly group slipped back into the shadows. However, an investigation by Symantec has found that the group has been active since at least March 2012 and its attacks have not only continued to the present day, but have also increased in number. Symantec has to date discovered 49 different organizations in more than 20 countries that have been attacked by Butterfly. Over time, a picture has emerged of a cybercrime gang systematically targeting large corporations in order to steal confidential data. Aside from the four companies which have publicly acknowledged attacks, Symantec has identified five other large technology firms compromised by Butterfly, primarily headquartered in the US. However, technology is not the only sector the group has focused on and Symantec has found evidence that Butterfly has attacked three major European pharmaceutical firms. In the first attack, the attackers gained a foothold by first attacking a small European office belonging to one firm and using this infection to then move on to its US office and European headquarters. This template appeared to be followed in the two subsequent attacks on big pharma firms, with Butterfly compromising computers in a number of regional offices before being discovered. Butterfly has also shown an interest in the commodities sector, attacking two major companies involved in gold and oil in late 2014. In addition to this, the Central Asian offices of a global law firm were compromised in June 2015. The company specializes in finance and natural resources specific to that region. The latter was one of at least three law firms the group has targeted over the past three years. Butterfly appears to have a good working knowledge of the organizations it is attacking and is focused on stealing specific kinds of information. In many attacks, the group has succeeded in compromising Microsoft Exchange or Lotus Domino email servers in order to intercept company emails and possibly use them to send counterfeit emails. The group has also attacked enterprise content management systems, which would often be home to legal and policy documents, financial records, product descriptions, and training documents. In some instances, the group has zoned in on specialist systems. For example, one attack saw it gain access to a Physical Security Information Management (PSIM) system, which is used for managing and monitoring physical security systems, including swipe card access. This could have provided the attackers with access to CCTV feeds, allowing them to track the movement of people around buildings. Butterfly has a number of malware tools at its disposal, all of which appear to be internally developed. Each tool is well documented, indicating that a group rather than an individual is responsible for the attacks. Its primary tools are two back door Trojans. OSX.Pintsized is capable of opening a back door on Mac OS X computers. Its Windows counterpart is Backdoor.Jiripbot, which has shown signs of continuous development over the past two years, with various minor features being removed or added. Butterfly has also developed a number of its own hacking tools. Hacktool.Securetunnel is a modified version of OpenSSH which contains additional code to pass a command-and-control (C&C) server address and port to a compromised computer. Hacktool.Bannerjack is meanwhile used to retrieve default messages issued by Telnet, HTTP, and generic Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) servers. Symantec believes it is used to locate any potentially vulnerable servers on the local network, likely including printers, routers, HTTP servers, and any other generic TCP server. Butterfly uses Hacktool.Multipurpose to help it move across a compromised networking by editing event logs to hide activity, dumping passwords, securely deleting files, encrypting files, and carrying out basic network enumeration. The group uses Hacktool.Eventlog to parse event logs, dumping out ones of interest, and delete entries. It also kills processes and performs a secure self-delete. Hacktool.Proxy.A is used to create a proxy connection that allows attackers to route traffic through an intermediary node, onto their destination node. Based on the profile of the victims and the type of information targeted by the attackers, Symantec believes that Butterfly is financially motivated, stealing information it can potentially profit from. The group appears to be agnostic about the nationality of its targets, leading us to believe that Butterfly is unaffiliated to any nation state. The group’s malware is documented in fluent English, indicating that some of the group members, if not all, can speak the language. They also display some knowledge of English-speaking pop culture, such as using the meme AYBABTU (All your base are belong to us) as an encryption key in Backdoor.Jiripbot. Command-and-control server activity is highest at times that correspond to the US working day, which may suggest some or all of the group are operating in this region. However, this could also be accounted for by the fact that many of the group’s victims are located in the US. Butterfly may profit from its attacks in a number of ways. The group may be operating as “hackers for hire”, targeting corporations on request. Alternatively, it may select its own targets and either sell stolen information to the highest bidder or use it for insider-trading purposes. Butterfly is a disciplined, technically capable group with a high level of operational security. Having managed to increase its level of activity over the past three years while maintaining a low profile, the group poses a threat that ought to be taken seriously by corporations.

    "title": "dyre financial trojan",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/dyre-financial-trojan",
    "content": "The Dyre financial Trojan has emerged over the past year to become one of the most potent financial fraud tools in operation. Dyre is configured to defraud the customers of more than 1,000 banks and other companies worldwide. Consumers in English-speaking countries, in particular the US and UK, are most at risk, since this is where the largest numbers of targeted banks are located. After a number of recent takedowns against major financial threats such as Gameover Zeus, Shylock, and Ramnit, the threat posed by these groups has receded but Dyre has taken their place as one of the main threats to ordinary consumers. Detected by Symantec as Infostealer.Dyre, Dyre targets Windows computers and can steal banking and other credentials by attacking all three major web browsers (Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Firefox). Dyre is a two-pronged threat. Aside from stealing credentials, it can also be used to infect victims with other types of malware, such as adding them to spam botnets. A year of growthAs outlined in a newtechnical paperfrom Symantec Security Response published today, the number of Dyre infections began to surge a year ago and the attackers behind this malware have steadily improved its capabilities and continued to build out supporting infrastructure. Dyre is mainly spread using spam emails. In most cases, the emails masquerade as businesses documents, voicemail, or fax messages. If the victim clicks on an email’s attachment, they are redirected to a malicious website which will install the Upatre downloader on their computer (detected by Symantec as Downloader.Upatre). Upatre is one of the most popular reconnaissance/downloader tools used by financial fraud groups and has previously been employed by the Gameover Zeus and Cryptolocker gangs. Upatre acts as a bridgehead on the victim’s computer, collecting information about it, attempting to disable security software, and finally downloading and installing the Dyre Trojan. Dyre is capable of using several different types of man-in-the-browser (MITB) attacks against the victim’s web browser to steal credentials. One MITB attack involves scanning every web page visited and checking it against a list of sites that Dyre is pre-configured to attack. If a match is found, it redirects the victim to a fake website that looks similar to its genuine counterpart. This fake website will harvest the victim’s credentials before redirecting back to the genuine website. A second MITB attack allows Dyre to alter the way legitimate websites are displayed in the browser window by adding malicious code to it to steal the victim’s login credentials. In some scenarios, Dyre may also display an additional fake page informing the victim that their computer has not been recognized and that additional credentials need to be provided to verify their identity, such as their date of birth, PIN code, and credit card details. Dyre is also used to infect victims with further malware and Symantec has to date seen seven other malware families being pushed out to infected computers. In many cases, the victim is added to a botnet, which is then used to power further spam campaigns and infect more victims. Based on the times at which the Dyre attackers are most active, Symantec believes that the group is likely based in Eastern Europe or Russia. A large amount of the group’s command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure is located in these regions, but a relatively low number of infections occur in these countries. It is possible that the group may be attempting to keep a low profile by avoiding targets close to home. Symantec and Norton products detect these threats as: Other threats distributed by the Dyre Trojan are detected as: For detailed technical analysis and indicators of compromise, please read our whitepaperDyre: Emerging threat on financial fraud landscape.

    "title": "duqu 20 cyberespionage",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/duqu-20-cyberespionage",
    "content": "Duqu 2.0, the cyberespionage tool that was used to compromise security firm Kaspersky Lab, has also been used in a number of other attack campaigns against a range of targets, including several telecoms firms. Analysis by Symantec concurs withKaspersky’s assessment todaythat Duqu 2.0 (detected by Symantec as W32.Duqu.B) is an evolution of the older Duqu worm, which wasused in a number of intelligence-gathering attacks against a range of industrial targets before it was exposed in 2011. Although their functionalities were different, the original Duqu worm had many similarities with the Stuxnet worm used to sabotage the Iranian nuclear development program. Symantec has found evidence that Duqu has been used in a number of different attack campaigns against a small number of selected targets. Among the organizations targeted were a European telecoms operator, a North African telecoms operator, and a South East Asian electronic equipment manufacturer. Infections were also found on computers located in the US, UK, Sweden, India, and Hong Kong. In addition to the attack against itself, Kaspersky believes Duqu was used to target countries involved in international negotiations surrounding Iran’s nuclear program. Given the diversity of targets, Symantec believes that the Duqu attackers have been involved in multiple cyberespionage campaigns. Some organizations may not be the ultimate targets of the group’s operations, but rather stepping stones towards the final target. The group’s interest in telecoms operators could be related to attempts to monitor communications by individuals using their networks. Symantec has found no evidence to suggest that it has been affected by attacks using this malware. This new version of Duqu is stealthy and resides solely in the computer’s memory, with no files written to disk. It comes in two variants. The first is a basic back door that appears to be used to gain a persistent foothold inside the targeted entity by infecting multiple computers. The second variant is more complex. It has the same structure as the first, but contains several modules that provide a range of functionality to the malware, such as gathering information on the infected computer, stealing data, network discovery, network infection, and communication with command-and-control (C&C) servers. This variant appears to be deployed to computers deemed to be targets of interest by the attackers. Duqu and Duqu 2.0 share large amounts of code, in addition to similarities in how that code is organized. The shared code includes a number of helper functions. For example, as shown in Figure 1, there is a “gen_random” function (as labelled by an engineer) that is shared between Duqu and Duqu 2.0. Not only is that gen_random code shared, but the code that calls that function is also organized almost identically. Such similarities in how code is called is repeated in several other locations throughout Duqu 2.0, including in how C&C IP addresses are formatted, how network messages are generated, and how files are encrypted and decrypted. When a program needs to store data, the program author will design structures to store that data in a logical and easily accessible manner. Duqu and Duqu 2.0 share a number of these data structures. Another shared feature between the two variants, as shown in Figure 1, is the use of a cookie header with a hardcoded string and a random string when sending messages to a C&C server. For example: A second shared feature in the network communications code is to connect to a number of Microsoft URLs to retrieve a proxy address, as shown in Figure 2. The list of Microsoft URLs connected to, by both variants, is identical. Finally, for network communications, when Duqu uses HTTP, it will use image names in the “Content-Disposition” header. For Duqu, the value “DSC00001.jpg” was used, whereas for Duqu 2.0, the value “%05d.gif” is used. Based on our analysis, Symantec believes that Duqu 2.0 is an evolution of the original threat, created by the same group of attackers. Duqu 2.0 is a fully featured information-stealing tool that is designed to maintain a long term, low profile presence on the target’s network. Its creators have likely used it as one of their main tools in multiple intelligence gathering campaigns. Given that activity surrounding the original version of Duqu dropped off following its discovery, it is likely that the group may now retreat before re-emerging with new malware. Symantec and Norton products detect this threat as: The Threat Hunter Team is a group of security experts within Broadcom whose mission is to investigate targeted attacks, drive enhanced protection in Symantec and Carbon Black products, and offer analysis that helps customers respond to attacks.

    "content": "An adept and well-resourced cyberespionage group known as Equation has been targeting organizations in a number of countries with a range of highly developed malware tools that go to great lengths to evade detection. New research from our peers at Kaspersky Lab has brought the group’s activities and tools to public attention. Symantec products detect the malware currently known to be used by Equation. The Equation group has used a range of different malware tools to mount its operations. Targeted computers are often compromised initially with malware that acts as a reconnaissance tool, gathering information about the infected computer and keeping a back door open, allowing for the installation of further malware if the computer is identified as something of interest. This is a common tactic adopted by cyberespionage groups. For example, the group behind the Turla Trojanusually initially infects its victims with the Wipbot Trojan before infecting them with Trojan Turla if it decides the computer is worthy of interest. The main tool used for this purpose appears to be Infostealer.Micstus, which is also known as “DoubleFantasy”. Trojan.Tripfant (also known as “TripleFantasy”) has similar capabilities and may be a replacement for Micstus. Equation has used a succession of advanced, multipurpose Trojans as its main malware tools. Trojan.Grayphish, which is also known as “GrayFish”, is believed to be the group’s current weapon of choice. It has a complex structure and stealthy characteristics. Grayphish includes a bootkit which allows the malware to take control of the entire Windows boot process. Highly stealthy, Grayphish uses an encrypted virtual file system hidden inside the Windows registry. This appears to have replaced the older Trojan.Equdrug (also known as “EquationDrug”) which was favored until recently. Equdrug in turn appears to have replaced the older Backdoor.Lassrv.B. Also known as “EquationLaser”, this Trojan seems to be one of the early workhorses used by the group until it was phased out. Grayphish and Equdrug have a modular structure. Aside from standard modules, a number of specialized features can also be employed. Among this is a highly sophisticated and rarely used module that allows the malware to reprogram the firmware on a range of popular hard disks, providing the attackers with a persistent presence that can survive disk reformatting. Symantec detects this module as Packed.Generic.483. In addition to these powerful Trojans, Equation has employed a number of specialist tools. Among these are Trojan.Grokey a custom keylogger (also known as “Grok”) and W32.Fanni, which is also known as “Fanny worm”. This worm’s chief purpose appears to be the targeting of air-gapped networks. It can receive commands and exfiltrate data through infected USB sticks. Fanny used two zero day exploits that were also used in the Stuxnet attacks. The exploits were used in Fanny prior to Stuxnet indicating that Equation had prior knowledge of the vulnerabilities. Another similarity lies in the fact that Stuxnet was also designed to attack air-gapped networks. ProtectionSymantec and Norton products have the following detections in place against malware used by the Equation group: Prior to this, Symantec detected Equation malware with a range of detections including Trojan.Tracur, Backdoor.Trojan, Trojan Horse, Trojan.Gen.2, and W32.Stration@mm.

    "content": "Symantec has been tracking the activities of the Carbanak cybercrime group for some time and our customers are protected against the malware used by this group. Carbanak, which has been the subject of media reports over the past 24 hours, is an atypical financial crime group, focused on defrauding banks rather than their customers. Symantec calls the group Silicon, but other vendors refer to it as Carbanak or Anunak. The main piece of malware that has recently been used by the group is Trojan.Carberp.B, which contains code borrowed from the older Trojan.Carberp. The group is believed to have targeted up to 100 banks and other financial institutions in multiple countries. The exact amount stolen by the Carbanak group is unknown, but estimates range from tens of millions of US dollars up to $1 billion. Carbanak is a skilled group of attackers, capable of gaining a foothold on the networks of targeted banks through malware hidden in spear-phishing emails. Once inside, the group patiently and stealthily moves across the network of a bank, gathering intelligence and compromising enough computers until it has the resources and intelligence to launch a successful attack. Carbanak has employed two main tactics to cash out. In some cases, it has transferred funds to accounts controlled by the attackers and operated by money mules. In other instances, it has compromised ATMs, hijacking them in order to dispense funds to people working for the group. Carbanak is not the first group to target ATMs. For example, research by Symantec found that attackers using Backdoor.Ploutus.B were able to compromise ATMs andempty them of cash by simply sending an SMS to the ATM. Financial institutions have been fighting malware for more than ten years, and the financial industry was the most attacked sector with 29 percent of all spear-phishing attacks in January 2015. Attackers who are motivated by financial reward quickly adapt to countermeasures, and many security implementations are ineffective at protecting against advanced attacks. It’s imperative that organizations implement layered security measures to protect against today’s advanced threats and educate employees about security policies and best practices. ProtectionSymantec and Norton products have the following detections in place against the malware used by the Carbanak group. Intrusion prevention system Advice for businesses and consumersSymantec advises users to be careful when dealing with suspicious emails and to avoid clicking on suspicious links or opening suspicious attachments.

    "title": "destover destructive malware south korea",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/destover-destructive-malware-south-korea",
    "content": "Backdoor.Destover, the destructive malware that was the subject of an FBI Flash Warning this week, shares several links to earlier attacks directed at targets in South Korea. Some samples of Destover report to a command-and-control (C&C) server that was also used by a version of Trojan.Volgmer crafted to attack South Korean targets. The shared C&C indicates that the same group may be behind both attacks. Volgmer is a targeted piece of malware, likely used by a single group, which has been used in limited attacks, possibly as a first stage reconnaissance tool. It can be used to gather system information and download further files for execution. Significantly, the version of Volgmer which shares a C&C with Destover was configured specifically to attack South Korean targets and will only run on Korean computers. Destover also share some techniques and component names with theJokra attacks against South Korea in 2013. However there is no hard evidence as yet to link the attacks and a copycat operation can’t be ruled out. Links also exist to theShamoon Attacks, with both attackers using the same, commercially available drivers. However, in this instance it appears highly unlikely that the same group was behind both attacks and instead it would appear that the Destover attacks copied techniques from Shamoon. Destover is a particularly damaging form of malware that is capable of completely wiping an infected computer. It was the subject of an FBI Flash Warning earlier this week after at least one variant of it was understood to have been used in a high profile attack. There are several malicious files associated with the FBI Destover report: Diskpartmg16.exe is the first file that is created on an infected computer and, when executed, it creates the files net_ver.dat and igfxtrayex.exe. When “diskpartmg16.exe” is run, it connects to a number of specific IP addresses within a set IP range, as well as computer names in the format “USSDIX[Machine Name]”. This indicates that this variant of Destover was not intended to be indiscriminate and the malware had instead been configured to only attack computers belonging to one particular organization. The destructive payload of Destover is carried by igfxtrayex.exe. In certain instances, when run, it will: Iissvr.exe, meanwhile, is a backdoor which listens on port 80. Once an attacker communicates with the compromised computer, this file displays a message, which reads: Some samples of Destover seen by Symantec link to a C&C server that has been used by variants of Trojan.Volgmer in the past. Symantec has been tracking Trojan.Volgmer for several months. Volgmer is a threat capable of opening a back door on an infected computer, which allows the malware to communicate with a C&C server to retrieve system information, execute commands, upload files, and download files for execution. Interestingly, the variants of Volgmer that share a C&C server with Destover are configured to end execution if the compromised computer’s region is not “Korea”. The Destover attackers use techniques and components, such as file names, that are similar to those used in theJokra attacks against South Korea in 2013. These attacks crippled servers belonging to several South Korean banks and broadcasting organizations and also defaced the website of a Korean telecoms firm. The malware used in the Jokra attacks contained code that did not begin wiping the hard drive until a set time period expired. Destover is also configured to perform a delayed wipe. Furthermore,media outlets in South Korea have reported that a number of similar file names were used in both attacks(Korean language link). Destover also share some commonalities with theShamoon Attacks. Both Destover and the malware used by the Shamoon attackers (W32.Disttrack) share some drivers. These are not malicious files and are commercially available drivers. While both Destover and Disttrack are destructive forms of malware, there is no evidence to suggest that the same group is behind both attacks. Symantec and Norton products detect this threat as Backdoor.Destover.

    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/regin-espionage-surveillance",
    "content": "An advanced piece of malware, known as Regin, has been used in systematic spying campaigns against a range of international targets since at least 2008. A back door-type Trojan, Regin is a complex piece of malware whose structure displays a degree of technical competence rarely seen. Customizable with an extensive range of capabilities depending on the target, it provides its controllers with a powerful framework for mass surveillance and has been used in spying operations against government organizations, infrastructure operators, businesses, researchers, and private individuals. It is likely that its development took months, if not years, to complete and its authors have gone to great lengths to cover its tracks. Its capabilities and the level of resources behind Regin indicate that it is one of the main cyberespionage tools used by a nation state. As outlined in a new technical whitepaper from Symantec, Backdoor.Regin is a multi-staged threat and each stage is hidden and encrypted, with the exception of the first stage.  Executing the first stage starts a domino chain of decryption and loading of each subsequent stage for a total of five stages.  Each individual stage provides little information on the complete package. Only by acquiring all five stages is it possible to analyze and understand the threat. Regin also uses a modular approach, allowing it to load custom features tailored to the target. This modular approach has been seen in other sophisticated malware families such as Flamer and Weevil (The Mask), while the multi-stage loading architecture is similar to that seen in the Duqu/Stuxnet family of threats. Regin infections have been observed in a variety of organizations between 2008 and 2011, after which  it was abruptly withdrawn. A new version of the malware resurfaced from 2013 onwards. Targets include private companies, government entities and research institutes. Almost half of all infections  targeted private individuals and small businesses. Attacks on telecoms companies appear to be designed to gain access to calls being routed through their infrastructure. Infections are also geographically diverse, having been identified in mainly in ten different countries. The infection vector varies among targets and no reproducible vector had been found at the time of writing. Symantec believes that some targets may be tricked into visiting spoofed versions of well-known websites and the threat may be installed through a Web browser or by exploiting an application. On one computer, log files showed that Regin originated from Yahoo! Instant Messenger through an unconfirmed exploit. Regin uses a modular approach, giving flexibility to the threat operators as they can load custom features tailored to individual targets when required. Some custom payloads are very advanced and exhibit a high degree of expertise in specialist sectors, further evidence of the level of resources available to Regin’s authors. There are dozens of Regin payloads. The threat’s standard capabilities include several Remote Access Trojan (RAT) features, such as capturing screenshots, taking control of the mouse’s point-and-click functions, stealing passwords, monitoring network traffic, and recovering deleted files. More specific and advanced payload modules were also discovered, such as a Microsoft IIS web server traffic monitor and a traffic sniffer of the administration of mobile telephone base station controllers. Regin’s developers put considerable effort into making it highly inconspicuous. Its low key nature means it can potentially be used in espionage campaigns lasting several years. Even when its presence is detected, it is very difficult to ascertain what it is doing. Symantec was only able to analyze the payloads after it decrypted sample files. It has several “stealth” features. These include anti-forensics capabilities, a custom-built encrypted virtual file system (EVFS), and alternative encryption in the form of a variant of RC5, which isn’t commonly used. Regin uses multiple sophisticated means to covertly communicate with the attacker including via ICMP/ping, embedding commands in HTTP cookies, and custom TCP and UDP protocols. Regin is a highly-complex threat which has been used in systematic data collection or intelligence gathering campaigns. The development and operation of this malware would have required a significant investment of time and resources, indicating that a nation state is responsible. Its design makes it highly suited for persistent, long term surveillance operations against targets. The discovery of Regin highlights how significant investments continue to be made into the development of tools for use in intelligence gathering. Symantec believes that many components of Regin remain undiscovered and additional functionality and versions may exist.  Additional analysis continues and Symantec will post any updates on future discoveries Indicators of compromise for security administrators and more detailed and technical information can be found in our technical paper -Regin: Top-tier espionage tool enables stealthy surveillance Symantec and Norton products detect this threat as Backdoor.Regin.

    "title": "turla espionage diplomats",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/turla-espionage-diplomats",
    "content": "A cyberespionage campaign involving malware known as Wipbot and Turla has systematically targeted the governments and embassies of a number of former Eastern Bloc countries. Trojan.Wipbot (known by other vendors as Tavdig) is a back door used to facilitate reconnaissance operations before the attackers shift to long term monitoring operations using Trojan.Turla (which is known by other vendors as Uroboros, Snake, and Carbon). It appears that this combination of malware has been used for classic espionage-type operations for at least four years. Because of the targets chosen and the advanced nature of the malware used, Symantec believes that a state-sponsored group was behind these attacks. Turla provides the attacker with powerful spying capabilities. Configured to start every time a computer starts, once the user opens a Web browser it opens a back door that enables communication with the attackers. Through this back door, the attackers can copy files from the infected computer, connect to servers, delete files, and load and execute other forms of malware, among other capabilities. The group behind Turla has a two-pronged attack strategy that involves infecting victims through spear phishing emails and watering hole attacks. The watering hole attacks display competent compromise capabilities, with the attackers compromising a range of legitimate websites and only delivering malware to victims visiting from pre-selected IP address ranges. These compromised websites deliver a payload of Trojan.Wipbot. It is highly likely that Wipbot is then used as a downloader to deliver Turla to the victim. While infections initially appeared to be spread over a range of European countries, closer analysis revealed that many infections in Western Europe occurred on computers that were connected to private government networks of former Eastern Bloc countries. These infections appear to have transpired in the embassies of these countries. Analysis of infections revealed that the attackers were heavily focused on a small number of countries. For example, in May of 2012, the office of the prime minister of a former Soviet Union member country was infected. This infection spread rapidly and up to 60 computers at the prime minister’s office were compromised. Another attack saw a computer at the embassy to France of a second former Soviet Union member infected in late 2012. During 2013, infections began to spread to other computers linked to the network of this country’s ministry of foreign affairs. In addition, its ministry of internal affairs was also infected.  Further investigation uncovered a systematic spying campaign targeted at its diplomatic service. Infections were discovered at embassies in Belgium, Ukraine, China, Jordan, Greece, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Poland, and Germany. At least five other countries in the region were targeted by similar attacks. While the attackers have largely focused on the former Eastern Bloc, a number of other targets were also found. These included the ministry for health of a Western European country, the ministry for education of a Central American country, a state electrical authority in the Middle East, and a medical organization in the US. Prior to publication, Symantec notified all relevant national authorities, such as Computer Emergency Response Centers (CERTs) that handle and respond to Internet security incidents. The group behind Turla uses spear phishing emails and watering hole attacks to infect victims. Some of the spear phishing emails purported to come from a military attaché at a Middle Eastern embassy and had an attachment masquerading as the minutes of meetings. Opening the attachment resulted in Trojan.Wipbot being dropped on to the victim’s computer. It is believed that Wipbot may be the delivery mechanism for Turla as they share several similarities in code and structure. Since September 2012, the group has compromised at least 84 legitimate websites to facilitate watering hole attacks. Websites owned by a number of different governments and international agencies were among those compromised by the attackers. Visitors to these sites were being redirected to Web servers where a ‘fingerprinting’ script was executed. This script collected some identifying information about the visitor’s computer. This phase of the campaign appeared to serve as an intelligence trawl, gathering information about what browsers and plugins website visitors were using, which would help identify which exploits would work best against them. The next phase of the operation was highly targeted, with servers then configured to drop Wipbot only to IP addresses associated with intended targets. In one instance, the malware delivered was disguised as a Shockwave installer bundle. Wipbot was then used to gather further information about the infected computer. If the attackers deemed the victim of interest, it appears likely that a second back door (Trojan.Turla) with far greater capabilities was downloaded on to the victim’s computer. Wipbot appears to act as a reconnaissance tool, while Turla is used to maintain a long term presence on the victim’s computer. Analysis conducted by Symantec has found several technical connections between Wipbot and Turla which indicates the same group or larger organization wrote both pieces of code. Symantec has been tracking the activities of the group behind Turla for a number of years. The identity of the attackers has yet to be established, although timestamps from activity associated with the attacks indicate that most activity occurs during the standard working day of the UTC +4 time zone. Turla is an evolution of an older piece of malware, Trojan.Minit, which has been in operation since 2004. The current campaign is the work of a well-resourced and technically competent attack group that is capable of penetrating many network defenses. It is focused on targets that would be of interest to a nation state, with spying and theft of sensitive data among its objectives. Symantec has the following detection in place for the malware used in these attacks: Update – January 22, 2015:Symantec Security Response has published a whitepaper containing more information about the attack group behind this campaign and detailed indicators of compromise for the malware involved.

    "title": "dragonfly energy companies sabotage",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/dragonfly-energy-companies-sabotage",
    "content": "An ongoing cyberespionage campaign against a range of targets, mainly in the energy sector, gave attackers the ability to mount sabotage operations against their victims. The attackers, known to Symantec as Dragonfly, managed to compromise a number of strategically important organizations for spying purposes and, if they had used the sabotage capabilities open to them, could have caused damage or disruption to energy supplies in affected countries. Among the targets of Dragonfly were energy grid operators, major electricity generation firms, petroleum pipeline operators, and energy industry industrial equipment providers. The majority of the victims were located in the United States, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, and Poland. The Dragonfly group is well resourced, with a range of malware tools at its disposal and is capable of launching attacks through a number of different vectors. Its most ambitious attack campaign saw it compromise a number of industrial control system (ICS) equipment providers, infecting their software with a remote access-type Trojan. This caused companies to install the malware when downloading software updates for computers running ICS equipment. These infections not only gave the attackers a beachhead in the targeted organizations’ networks, but also gave them the means to mount sabotage operations against infected ICS computers. This campaign follows in the footsteps of Stuxnet, which was the first known major malware campaign to target ICS systems. While Stuxnet was narrowly targeted at the Iranian nuclear program and had sabotage as its primary goal, Dragonfly appears to have a much broader focus with espionage and persistent access as its current objective with sabotage as an optional capability if required. In addition to compromising ICS software, Dragonfly has used spam email campaigns and watering hole attacks to infect targeted organizations. The group has used two main malware tools: Backdoor.Oldrea and Trojan.Karagany. The former appears to be a custom piece of malware, either written by or for the attackers. Prior to publication, Symantec notified affected victims and relevant national authorities, such as Computer Emergency Response Centers (CERTs) that handle and respond to Internet security incidents. The Dragonfly group, which is also known by other vendors as Energetic Bear, appears to have been in operation since at least 2011 and may have been active even longer than that. Dragonfly initially targeted defense and aviation companies in the US and Canada before shifting its focus mainly to US and European energy firms in early 2013. The campaign against the European and American energy sector quickly expanded in scope. The group initially began sending malware in phishing emails to personnel in target firms. Later, the group added watering hole attacks to its offensive, compromising websites likely to be visited by those working in energy in order to redirect them to websites hosting an exploit kit. The exploit kit in turn delivered malware to the victim’s computer. The third phase of the campaign was the Trojanizing of legitimate software bundles belonging to three different ICS equipment manufacturers. Dragonfly bears the hallmarks of a state-sponsored operation, displaying a high degree of technical capability. The group is able to mount attacks through multiple vectors and compromise numerous third party websites in the process. Dragonfly has targeted multiple organizations in the energy sector over a long period of time. Its current main motive appears to be cyberespionage, with potential for sabotage a definite secondary capability. Analysis of the compilation timestamps on the malware used by the attackers indicate that the group mostly worked between Monday and Friday, with activity mainly concentrated in a nine-hour period that corresponded to a 9am to 6pm working day in the UTC +4 time zone. Based on this information, it is likely the attackers are based in Eastern Europe. Dragonfly uses two main pieces of malware in its attacks. Both are remote access tool (RAT) type malware which provide the attackers with access and control of compromised computers. Dragonfly’s favored malware tool is Backdoor.Oldrea, which is also known as Havex or the Energetic Bear RAT. Oldrea acts as a back door for the attackers on to the victim’s computer, allowing them to extract data and install further malware. Oldrea appears to be custom malware, either written by the group itself or created for it. This provides some indication of the capabilities and resources behind the Dragonfly group. Once installed on a victim’s computer, Oldrea gathers system information, along with lists of files, programs installed, and root of available drives. It will also extract data from the computer’s Outlook address book and VPN configuration files. This data is then written to a temporary file in an encrypted format before being sent to a remote command-and-control (C&C) server controlled by the attackers. The majority of C&C servers appear to be hosted on compromised servers running content management systems, indicating that the attackers may have used the same exploit to gain control of each server. Oldrea has a basic control panel which allows an authenticated user to download a compressed version of the stolen data for each particular victim. The second main tool used by Dragonfly is Trojan.Karagany. Unlike Oldrea, Karagany was available on the underground market. The source code for version 1 of Karagany was leaked in 2010. Symantec believes that Dragonfly may have taken this source code and modified it for its own use. This version is detected by Symantec as Trojan.Karagany!gen1. Karagany is capable of uploading stolen data, downloading new files, and running executable files on an infected computer. It is also capable of running additional plugins, such as tools for collecting passwords, taking screenshots, and cataloging documents on infected computers. Symantec found that the majority of computers compromised by the attackers were infected with Oldrea. Karagany was only used in around 5 percent of infections. The two pieces of malware are similar in functionality and what prompts the attackers to choose one tool over another remains unknown. The Dragonfly group has used at least three infection tactics against targets in the energy sector. The earliest method was an email campaign, which saw selected executives and senior employees in target companies receive emails containing a malicious PDF attachment. Infected emails had one of two subject lines: “The account” or “Settlement of delivery problem”. All of the emails were from a single Gmail address. The spam campaign began in February 2013 and continued into June 2013. Symantec identified seven different organizations targeted in this campaign. The number of emails sent to each organization ranged from one to 84. The attackers then shifted their focus to watering hole attacks, comprising a number of energy-related websites and injecting an iframe into each which redirected visitors to another compromised legitimate website hosting the Lightsout exploit kit. Lightsout exploits either Java or Internet Explorer in order to drop Oldrea or Karagany on the victim’s computer. The fact that the attackers compromised multiple legitimate websites for each stage of the operation is further evidence that the group has strong technical capabilities. In September 2013, Dragonfly began using a new version of this exploit kit, known as the Hello exploit kit. The landing page for this kit contains JavaScript which fingerprints the system, identifying installed browser plugins. The victim is then redirected to a URL which in turn determines the best exploit to use based on the information collected. The most ambitious attack vector used by Dragonfly was the compromise of a number of legitimate software packages. Three different ICS equipment providers were targeted and malware was inserted into the software bundles they had made available for download on their websites. All three companies made equipment that is used in a number of industrial sectors, including energy. The first identified Trojanized software was a product used to provide VPN access to programmable logic controller (PLC) type devices. The vendor discovered the attack shortly after it was mounted, but there had already been 250 unique downloads of the compromised software. The second company to be compromised was a European manufacturer of specialist PLC type devices. In this instance, a software package containing a driver for one of its devices was compromised. Symantec estimates that the Trojanized software was available for download for at least six weeks in June and July 2013. The third firm attacked was a European company which develops systems to manage wind turbines, biogas plants, and other energy infrastructure. Symantec believes that compromised software may have been available for download for approximately ten days in April 2014. The Dragonfly group is technically adept and able to think strategically. Given the size of some of its targets, the group found a “soft underbelly” by compromising their suppliers, which are invariably smaller, less protected companies.

    "content": "For the past few years, reports have continued to emerge detailing the activities of actors behind various targeted attacks or Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). Here at Symantec Security Response, we’ve been keeping our eyes on a group that we believe are among the best of breed. We’ve given them the name of Hidden Lynx—after a string that was found in the command and control server communications. This group has a hunger and drive that surpass other well-known groups such as APT1/Comment Crew. Key characteristics of this group are: These attributes are shown by the relentless campaigns waged against multiple concurrent targets over a sustained period of time. They are the pioneers of the “watering hole” technique used to ambush targets, they have early access to zero-day vulnerabilities, and they have the tenacity and patience of an intelligent hunter to compromise the supply chain to get at the true target. These supply chain attacks are carried out by infecting computers at a supplier of an intended target and then waiting for the infected computers to be installed and call home, clearly these are cool calculated actions rather than impulsive forays of amateurs. This group doesn’t just limit itself to a handful of targets; instead it targets hundreds of different organizations in many different regions, even concurrently. Given the breadth and number of targets and regions involved, we infer that this group is most likely a professional hacker-for-hire operation that are contracted by clients to provide information. They steal on demand, whatever their clients are interested in, hence the wide variety and range of targets. We also believe that to carry out attacks of this scale, the group must have considerable hacking expertise at its disposal, perhaps 50 to 100 operatives are employed and organized into at least two distinct teams both tasked with carrying out different activities using different tools and techniques. These types of attacks require time and effort to carry out, some of the campaigns require research and intelligence gathering before any successful attacks can be mounted. At the front line of this group is a team that uses disposable tools along with basic but effective techniques to attack many different targets. They may also act as intelligence collectors too. This team we call Team Moudoor after the name of the Trojan that they use. Moudoor is a back door Trojan that the team uses liberally without worry about discovery by security firms. The other team acts like a special operations unit, elite personnel used to crack the most valuable or toughest targets. The elite team uses a Trojan named Naid and are therefore referred to as Team Naid. Unlike Moudoor, the Naid Trojan is used sparingly and with care to avoid detection and capture, like a secret weapon that is only used when failure is not an option. Since 2011, we have observed at least six significant campaigns by this group. The most notable of these campaigns is the VOHO attack campaign of June, 2012. What was particularly interesting about this attack was the use of the watering hole attack technique and the compromise of Bit9’s trusted file signing infrastructure. The VOHO campaign was ultimately targeting US defense contractors whose systems were protected by Bit9’s trust-based protection software but when the Hidden Lynx attackers’ progress was blocked by this obstacle, they reconsidered their options and found that the best way around the protection was to compromise the heart of the protection system itself and subvert it for their own purpose. This is exactly what they did when they diverted their attention to Bit9 and breached their systems. Once breached, the attackers quickly found their way into the file signing infrastructure that was the foundation of the Bit9 protection model, they then used this system to sign a number of malware files and then these files were used in turn to compromise the true intended targets. For those interested in more in-depth information, we havepublished a whitepaperthat describes the group and the attack campaigns carried out by them. We have also put together an infographic that summarizes the key information about this prolific Hidden Lynx group.

    "content": "Yesterday, June 25, the Korean peninsula observed a series of cyberattacks coinciding with the 63rd anniversary of the start of the Korean War. While multiple attacks were conducted by multiple perpetrators, one of the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks observed yesterday against South Korean government websites can be directly linked to the DarkSeoul gang and Trojan.Castov. We can now attribute multiple previous high-profile attacks to the DarkSeoul gang over the last 4 years against South Korea, in addition to yesterday’s attack. These attacks include the devastatingJokra attacksin March 2013 that wiped numerous computer hard drives at South Korean banks and television broadcasters, as well as theattacks on South Korean financial companiesin May 2013. Conducting DDoS attacks and hard disk wiping on key historical dates is not new for the DarkSeoul gang. They previously conducted DDoS and wiping attacks on the United States Independence Day as well. The DarkSeoul gang’s attacks tend to follow similar methods of operation. Trademarks of their attacks include: The attacks conducted by the DarkSeoul gang have required intelligence and coordination, and in some cases have demonstrated technical sophistication. While nation-state attribution is difficult, South Koreanmedia reportshave pointed to an investigation which concluded the attackers were working on behalf of North Korea. Symantec expects the DarkSeoul attacks to continue and, regardless of whether the gang is working on behalf of North Korea or not, the attacks are both politically motivated and have the necessary financial support to continue acts of cybersabotage on organizations in South Korea. Cybersabotage attacks on a national scale have been rare—Stuxnet and Shamoon (W32.Disttrack) are the other two main examples. However, the DarkSeoul gang is almost unique in its ability to carry out such high-profile and damaging attacks over several years.

    "title": "duqu next stuxnet",
    "link": "https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/duqu-next-stuxnet",
    "content": "On October 14, 2011, a research lab with strong international connections alerted us to a sample that appeared to be very similar to Stuxnet. They named the threat \"Duqu\" [dyü-kyü] because it creates files with the file name prefix “~DQ”. The research lab provided us with samples recovered from computer systems located in Europe, as well as a detailed report with their initial findings, including analysis comparing the threat to Stuxnet, which we were able to confirm. Parts of Duqu are nearly identical to Stuxnet, but with a completely different purpose. Duqu is essentially the precursor to a future Stuxnet-like attack. The threat was written by the same authors (or those that have access to the Stuxnet source code) and appears to have been created since the last Stuxnet file was recovered. Duqu's purpose is to gather intelligence data and assets from entities, such as industrial control system manufacturers, in order to more easily conduct a future attack against another third party. The attackers are looking for information such as design documents that could help them mount a future attack on an industrial control facility. Duqu does not contain any code related to industrial control systems and is primarily a remote access Trojan (RAT). The threat does not self-replicate. Our telemetry shows the threat was highly targeted toward a limited number of organizations for their specific assets. However, it’s possible that other attacks are being conducted against other organizations in a similar manner with currently undetected variants. The attackers used Duqu to install another infostealer that could record keystrokes and gain other system information. The attackers were searching for assets that could be used in a future attack. In one case, the attackers did not appear to successfully exfiltrate any sensitive data, but details are not available in all cases. Two variants were recovered, and in reviewing our archive of submissions, the first recording of one of the binaries was on September 1, 2011. However, based on file compile times, attacks using these variants may have been conducted as early as December 2010. One of the variant’s driver files was signed with a valid digital certificate that expires August 2, 2012. The digital certificate belongs to a company headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan. The certificate was revoked on October 14, 2011. Duqu uses HTTP and HTTPS to communicate with a command-and-control (C&C) server that at the time of writing is still operational. The attackers were able to download additional executables through the C&C server, including an infostealer that can perform actions such as enumerating the network, recording keystrokes, and gathering system information. The information is logged to a lightly encrypted and compressed local file, which then must be exfiltrated out. The threat uses a custom C&C protocol, primarily downloading or uploading what appear to be JPG files. However, in addition to transferring dummy JPG files, additional data for exfiltration is encrypted and sent, and likewise received. Finally, the threat is configured to run for 36 days. After 36 days, the threat will automatically remove itself from the system. Duqu shares a great deal of code with Stuxnet; however, the payload is completely different. Instead of a payload designed to sabotage an industrial control system, the payload has been replaced with general remote access capabilities. The creators of Duqu had access to the source code of Stuxnet, not just the Stuxnet binaries. The attackers intend to use this capability to gather intelligence from a private entity to aid future attacks on a third party. While suspected, no similar precursor files have been recovered that predate the Stuxnet attacks. You can find additional details inour paper here. The research lab that originally found the sample has allowed us to share their initial report as an appendix. We expect to make further updates over the coming days.Key points: Note: At press time we have recovered additional variants from an additional organization in Europe with a compilation time of October 17, 2011. These variants have not yet been analyzed. More information will follow. Update [October 18, 2011] -Symantec has known that some of the malware files associated with the W32.Duqu threat were signed with private keys associated with a code signing certificate issued to a Symantec customer. Symantec revoked the customer certificate in question on October 14, 2011. Our investigation into the key’s usage leads us to the conclusion that the private key used for signing Duqu was stolen, and not fraudulently generated for the purpose of this malware. At no time were Symantec’s roots and intermediate CAs at risk, nor were there any issues with any CA, intermediate, or other VeriSign or Thawte brands of certificates. Our investigation shows zero evidence of any risk to our systems; we used the correct processes to authenticate and issue the certificate in question to a legitimate customer in Taiwan.

    "content": "We’re pleased to announce that we’ve compiled the results of many weeks of fast-paced analysis of Stuxnet into awhite paper entitled the W32.Stuxnet Dossier. On top of finding elements we described in the ongoing Stuxnet summer blog series, you will find all technical details about the threat’s components and data structures, as well as high-level information, including: The paper is scheduled to be delivered at the Virus Bulletin 2010 conference and can be downloaded here. Our investigations into Stuxnet started on July 13 of this year when the Symantec Security Response team began a journey full of surprises, wrong turns, frustrating moments, and moments of validation. Virusblokada, a security company in Belarus, announced they found a new interesting malware sample using an unpatched vulnerability to spread to removable drives and much of the media focused on the zero-day vulnerability. However, there was much more. Soon people began describing a threat now known as Stuxnet as a tool for cyber espionage stealing design data for industrial control systems, such as gas pipelines and power plants. Stuxnet then had difficulty shedding those initial reports with most only noting its use of a zero-day exploit and its ability to potentially steal design documents. Only more recently did the general public realize Stuxnet’s ultimate goal was to sabotage an industrial control system. Analyzing Stuxnet has been one of the most challenging issues we have worked on. The code is sophisticated, incredibly large, required numerous experts in different fields, and mostly bug-free, which is rare for your average piece of malware. Stuxnet is clearly not average. We estimate the core team was five to ten people and they developed Stuxnet over six months. The development was in all likelihood highly organized and thus this estimate doesn’t include the quality assurance and management resources needed to organize the development as well as a probable host of other resources required, such as people to setup test systems to mirror the target environment and maintain the command and control server. When looking through our archive, we were able to find a sample from June 2009. Therefore the attackers had been active for at least a year. We would not be surprised if they started even prior to that. Typical threats attack virtual or individual assets like credit card numbers. The real-world implications of Stuxnet are beyond any threat we have seen in the past and despite the exciting challenge in reverse engineering Stuxnet and understanding its purpose, Stuxnet is the type of threat we hope to never see again. In addition, we want to acknowledge the entire Symantec Security Response Team. Analyzing Stuxnet was a huge effort that involved many individuals who worked tirelessly to uncover Stuxnet’s ultimate motivation. Without each individual’s contribution, our exclusive analysis would have not been possible. Finally, while we believe we have uncovered all the major and even minor details of Stuxnet, the ultimate target of Stuxnet remains unknown. We have reversed and extracted all the STL code used, but the STL code does not provide any context of what it is controlling in the real world. For those that aren’t familiar with ICS systems, essentially the STL code will set a certain address to a number. But what is behind that address – a pump, a centrifuge, a conveyor belt – cannot be seen from the code. However, we suspect there might be some common constructs, such as certain values you’d only see when activating a centrifuge versus a pump used in STL coding that might give more clues to the target. Therefore if you are a verifiable expert in STL coding that has worked in multiple critical infrastructure industries and coded large STL programs for large industrial control systems in those multiple industries and wish to help, please contact me.
