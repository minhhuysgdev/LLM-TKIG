The vulnerability (CVE-2024-26169) occurs in the Windows Error Reporting Service. If exploited on affected systems, it can permit an attacker to elevate their privileges. The vulnerability was patched on March 12, 2024, and, at the time, Microsoft said there was no evidence of its exploitation in the wild. However, analysis of an exploit tool deployed in recent attacks revealed evidence that it could have been compiled prior to patching, meaning at least one group may have been exploiting the vulnerability as a zero-day.

    "content": "With the surging popularity of mobile applications, the landscape of cybersecurity is encountering increasingly intricate and discreet forms of malicious software. One common strategy in the realm of cybersecurity is code obfuscation. This practice involves the deliberate alteration of various elements within the code, such as variables, functions, and class names, rendering them virtually indecipherable. This not only poses a formidable challenge for anyone attempting to discern their purpose from their names but also significantly amplifies the complexity involved in decompilation. Recently, our attention was caught by a Spyware cluster, which has employed a series of ingenious techniques to heighten the difficulties associated with static analysis. These methods, which we will discuss b",

Some of the machines had two network interfaces to communicate with different networks, but all packet forwarding functionality was disabled. Each machine ran various network services that were reachable from its neighbors only. In this section we will dissect the network traffic between two backdoor instances running on the separate computers “Alice-PC” and “Bob-PC”.

News of the attack broke yesterday (Friday 3 July), prompting Kaseya to urge VSAusers to shut down their VSA serversto prevent them from being compromised. The attack may have been timed to coincide with the 4th of July holiday weekend in the U.S., where many organizations may be lightly staffed. Are Symantec customers protected? Yes, Symantec Endpoint products proactively blocked tools used to deliver the ransomware payload in this wave of attacks.",

The control flow, what happens after that contact is made, is also noteworthy. The control flow of Sunburst varies depending on commands received from the attacker. However, the general control flow can be reconstructed in order to understand how communications would have progressed on machines that were of interest to the attackers. As described in our previous blog, two types of DNS requests are used for initial communications, and both receive DNS replies. The attackers use two fields in the DNS replies: “A records” for control flow and CNAME to hold data on a secondary C&C server. Normally, when querying DNS,",

Sunburst (Backdoor.Sunburst), the malware which was used to Trojanize the SolarWinds Orion software, uses a domain generation algorithm (DGA) to generate domain names to contact for C&C purposes. However, unlike most DGAs, this DGA does not just randomly generate characters. Instead, information is encoded into the text that makes up the generated domain name",

Software supply chain attacks are relatively stealthy to begin with, since signed software from a trusted source is less likely to raise red flags. However, the attackers weren’t content to rely on the cover this provided and also took several other steps to avoid detection. To begin with, the Sunburst backdoor (Backdoor.Sunburst), which was delivered using a Trojanized update to SolarWinds Orion, sets a delay time of up to 14 days before execution. In other words, no malicious activity will begin until this period has elapsed. The length of time selected is most likely to increase the likelihood t",

Two of the men, who were based in Malaysia, were arrested and their extradition to the U.S. has been requested. The other five are based in China and remain at large. The attacks were attributed to a China-linked organization dubbed APT41 and involved a combination of intellectual property theft and financially motivated cyber crime. While some of our peers monitor APT41 as a single operation, Symantec regards it as two distinct actors: Grayfly and Blackfly. Grayfly has been particularly active in recent years, mounting high volume espionage attacks against organizations spread across Asia, Europe, and North America. They are i",

From a resurgence in cryptojacking activity to the return of a major malware distribution platform, let’s take a quick look at the trends that shaped the cyber security threat landscape in the second quarter of 2020. After a sharp decline in cryptojacking following the shutdown of browser-based mining script maker CoinHive in March 2019, the second quarter of 2020 saw a resurgence in activity. Browser-based cryptojacking events blocked by Symantec saw a 163 percent increase in Q2 2020 compared to the previous quarter. This spike in activity coincides with an increase in the value of cryptocurrencie",
